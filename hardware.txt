*****
If you are interested in local wildlife, you may want to consider this
wildlife camera project. [Arnis] has been using his to film
foxes and mice. The core components of this build are a Raspberry Pi and an
infrared camera module specifically made for the Pi. The system runs on a
20,000 mAh battery, which [Arnis] claims results in around 18 hours of battery
life.

*****
Conventional wisdom says small, powerful embedded Linux like the Raspberry Pi,
Beaglebone, or the Intel Edison are inherently manufactured devices, and
certainly not something the homebrew tinkerer can produce at home. [hak8or] is
doing just that, producing not one, but two

*****
In 2009 I created my first automated mushroom cultivator using an ATMega328
and networked Linux computer. It monitored and regulated the temperature and
humidity of a growth chamber with the use of a humidifier and heater attached
to individually-controlled 120-VAC relays, with a simple web control
interface. In 2012 I redesigned the software to run entirely on the Raspberry
Pi (RPi) and documented the build shortly after. Although the system worked,
it was still very basic and lacked some crucial features I desired. Over the
past couple months I’ve been redesigning both the hardware and the software.
I’m writing to present the third milestone in development.

Raspberry Pi Compute Module Development Kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compute module contains the guts of a Raspberry Pi (the BCM2835 processor
and 512Mbyte of RAM) as well as a 4Gbyte eMMC Flash device (which is the
equivalent of the SD card in the Pi). This is all integrated on to a small
67.6x30mm board which fits into a standard DDR2 SODIMM connector (the same
type of connector as used for laptop memory*). The Flash memory is connected
directly to the processor on the board, but the remaining processor interfaces
are available to the user via the connector pins. You get the full flexibility
of the BCM2835 SoC, which means that many more GPIOs and interfaces are
available as compared to the Raspberry Pi, and designing the module into a
custom system should be relatively straightforward as we’ve put all the tricky
bits onto the module itself.

The Compute Module IO Board is a simple, open-source breakout board that you
can plug a Compute Module into. It provides the necessary power to the module,
and gives you the ability to program the module’s Flash memory, access the
processor interfaces in a slightly more friendly fashion (pin headers and
flexi connectors, much like the Pi) and provides the necessary HDMI and USB
connectors so that you have an entire system that can boot Raspbian (or the OS
of your choice). This board provides both a starting template for those who
want to design with the Compute Module, and a quick way to start experimenting
with the hardware and building and testing a system before going to the
expense of fabricating a custom board.
 
The Compute Module IO Board has a 22-way 0.5mm FFC for two camera ports, with
CAM0 being a 2-lane interface and CAM1 being the full 4-lane interface. To
attach a standard Raspberry Pi Camera to the Compute module IO Board a small
camera adaptor board is used to adapt the 22W FFC to the Pi 15W FFC. The
Compute Module also has 2 MIPI serial display interfaces (DSI); a small camera
adaptor board included in the kit is used to adapt the 22W FFC to the Pi 15W
FFC.

*****
We have just release the 1st revision of our low power library for Arduino.
Please bear in mind that, most of the Arduino boards (official and also compatible) that is currently available in market (except some brilliant design from JeeLabs and Wiblocks, but there might be more out there that we are not aware of) are not low power by design. Low power design requires both hardware and software implementation. Our Mini Ultra 8 MHz (Arduino compatible) board is designed to be low power and is basically the testing platform for this library. Using the library on any Arduino boards (official or compatible) may and may not yield the best result.

*Designing Hardware/Software Systems for Embedded High-Performance Computing* - http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06832[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06832+]

*****
In this work, we propose an architecture and methodology to design hardware/software systems for high-performance embedded computing on FPGA. The hardware side is based on a many-core architecture whose design is generated automatically given a set of architectural parameters. Both the architecture and the methodology were evaluated running dense matrix multiplication and sparse matrix-vector multiplication on a ZYNQ-7020 FPGA platform. The results show that using a system-level design of the system avoids complex hardware design and still provides good performance results.

*Using System Hyper Pipelining (SHP) to Improve the Performance of a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) Mapped on an FPGA* - http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07139[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07139+]

*****
The well known method C-Slow Retiming (CSR) can be used to automatically convert a given CPU into a multithreaded CPU with independent threads. These CPUs are then called streaming or barrel processors. System Hyper Pipelining (SHP) adds a new flexibility on top of CSR by allowing a dynamic number of threads to be executed and by enabling the threads to be stalled, bypassed and reordered. SHP is now applied on the programming elements (PE) of a coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA). By using SHP, more performance can be achieved per PE. Fork-Join operations can be implemented on a PE using the flexibility provided by SHP to dynamically adjust the number of threads per PE. Multiple threads can share the same data locally, which greatly reduces the data traffic load on the CGRA's routing structure. The paper shows the results of a CGRA using SHP-ed RISC-V cores as PEs implemented on a FPGA.

*SparkCL: A Unified Programming Framework for Accelerators on Heterogeneous Clusters* - http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01120[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01120+]

*****
We introduce SparkCL, an open source unified programming framework based on Java, OpenCL and the Apache Spark framework. The motivation behind this work is to bring unconventional compute cores such as FPGAs/GPUs/APUs/DSPs and future core types into mainstream programming use. The framework allows equal treatment of different computing devices under the Spark framework and introduces the ability to offload computations to acceleration devices. The new framework is seamlessly integrated into the standard Spark framework via a Java-OpenCL device programming layer which is based on Aparapi and a Spark programming layer that includes new kernel function types and modified Spark transformations and actions. The framework allows a single code base to target any type of compute core that supports OpenCL and easy integration of new core types into a Spark cluster.

FPGA technology can offer significantly higher performance at much lower power than is available from CPUs and GPUs in many computational problems. Unfortunately, programming for FPGA (using hardware description languages, HDL) is a difficult and not-trivial task and is not intuitive for C/C++/Java programmers. To bring the gap between programming effectiveness and difficulty the High Level Synthesis (HLS) approach is promoting by many FPGA vendors. Nowadays, time-intensive calculations are mainly performed on GPU/CPU architectures, but can also be successfully performed using HLS approach. In the paper we implement a selected numerical algorithm (bandwidth selection for kernel density estimators, KDE) using HLS and show techniques which were used to optimise the final FPGA implementation.

FPGALink
^^^^^^^^

The aim of the FPGALink project is to provide a hardware abstraction layer for
hardware involving an FPGA connected to a computer over USB, to abstract core
functionality like FPGA-programming and subsequent host-FPGA communication. It
doesn't matter whether the hardware uses an AVR, an FX2LP or an ARM-based
micro for its USB interface. It doesn't matter whether the FPGA is from Xilinx
or Altera or Lattice or whomever. It doesn't matter whether the interface
between them is a fast 43MiB/s parallel synchronous interface, a much slower
EPP interface or some sort of USART connection. The cross-platform,
cross-language host-side API is the same, and the FPGA-side (VHDL or Verilog)
FIFO interface is the same, so you can easily port your design to a new FPGA
devkit or to your own custom PCB.

migen
^^^^^

Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and
VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven
model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for synchronous
circuits, which represent the lion's share of today's logic designs. Counter-
intuitive arithmetic rules result in steeper learning curves and provide a
fertile ground for subtle bugs in designs. Finally, support for procedural
generation of logic (metaprogramming) through "generate" statements is very
limited and restricts the ways code can be made generic, reused and organized.

To address those issues, we have developed the Migen FHDL library that
replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and
synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave
like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design's logic to
be constructed by a Python program. This last point enables hardware designers
to take advantage of the richness of the Python language - object oriented
programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading, libraries,
etc. - to build well organized, reusable and elegant designs.

Other Migen libraries are built on FHDL and provide various tools such as a
system-on-chip interconnect infrastructure, a dataflow programming system, a
more traditional high-level synthesizer that compiles Python routines into
state machines with datapaths, and a simulator that allows test benches to be
written in Python.
