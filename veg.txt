Freeze protection efforts should be based on the type of freeze, temperature, and wind speed that is impacting your crop. To apply frost protection, consider your crop value, the freeze protection capacity of your system, and the cropâ€™s susceptibility to injury at each growth stage.

Summer squash is one of the most popular warm season vegetables grown in home gardens. Unfortunately, the levels of insect attacks on summer squash have risen dramatically over the last 10 years. Safe and effective controls are needed to help produce this important crop with all of the pressures of insect pests. This publication will discuss both organic and non-organic solutions for homeowners to try in their home garden, including the use of barriers, trap crops and chemical controls.

"While pumpkins are edible and grown for both their flesh and seeds, they are more commonly used as fall decorations. This member of the cucurbit family can be found in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. While pumpkins are not very difficult to grow, they do require a substantial amount of space for their sprawling vines. Selecting the right cultivar and following good cultural practices are key to successfully growing pumpkins."

A wild tomato species from the Galapagos Islands has been discovered by scientists from Wageningen University & Research to be resistant to a wide range of pest insects. This species is closely related to the cultivated tomato, making the resilience easier to interbreed into the latter and ultimately making it resistant to many different types of insects.

=====
Charles Rick was a plant geneticist at UC Davis. His research and collecting efforts over a 50-year career led to the establishment of the C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center. It is a seed bank of tomato germplasm. This center at UC Davis now maintains nearly 1,200 wild tomato accessions representing 16 different taxonomic species. Many of these wild accessions were collected by Rick and his colleagues during 15 major collecting expeditions. Thanks to their efforts, todayâ€™s breeders have rich sources of genetic diversity with which to study and improve crop plants.

This is the story of how one wild tomato relative, a rare and endangered nightshade from the Atacama Desert of Chile, was (re)discovered and bred (eventually) with tomato.

=====
A home garden simply is not complete without a few tomato plants. At times, it can be a little challenging to keep tomatoes healthy, but no other vegetable comes close to bearing as much produce in such a limited space. Staking and pruning are two common practices that can help tomatoes stay healthier and produce larger fruit. The system of staking you choose and how vigorously you prune your crop depends on the type of tomatoes you are growing.

It has been shown that a large variation is present and exploitable from wild Solanum species but most of it is still untapped. Considering the thousands of Solanum accessions in different gene banks and probably even more that are still untouched in the Andes, it is a challenge to exploit the diversity of tomato. What have we gained from tomato domestication and breeding and what can we gain in the future?

=====
The Solanaceae (or nightshades) are one of the best-studied plant families, yet their evolutionary origins have thus far been relatively obscure. Corroborative fossil evidence of molecular phylogenetic divergence dates has been lacking. Wilf et al. present 52-million-year-old fossils of lantern fruits from Argentina, which they ascribe to the modern genus Physalis. These fossil finds suggest a much earlier origin of the lantern fruit lineage and indicate that the Solanaceae may have diversified before the final breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent.

A collection of 163 accessions, including Solanum pimpinellifolium, Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum, was selected to represent the genetic and morphological variability of tomato at its centers of origin and domestication: Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador and Mesoamerica. The collection is enriched with S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme from the Amazonian region that has not been analyzed previously nor used extensively. The collection has been morphologically characterized showing diversity for fruit, flower and vegetative traits. Their genomes were sequenced in the Varitome project and are publicly available.

Relationships among wild relatives of tomato, potato, and pepino - https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/62490[`https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/62490`]

=====
With ca. 200 species, the informally named Potato clade represents one of the larger subgroups of the enormous genus Solanum. Because its members include the potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (S. lycopersicum), and pepino (S. muricatum), it is the most economically important clade in the genus. These crop species and their close relatives have been the focus of intensive research, but relationships among major lineages of the Potato clade remain poorly understood. In this study, we use sequences from the nuclear ITS and waxy (GBSSI) and plastid trnTâ€“trnF and trnSâ€“trnG to estimate a phylogeny and further explore relationships within the Potato clade. With increased sampling over past studies, the Potato clade emerges as a strongly supported clade and comprises 12â€“13 subclades which, for the most part, correspond to traditionally recognized sections. Solanum sect. Regmandra is sister to the rest of the lineages of the Potato clade which are, in turn, organized into two major subclades: (i) sections Herpystichum and Pteroidea, and (ii) sections Anarrhichomenum, Articulatum, Basarthrum, Etuberosum, Juglandifolia, Lycopersicoides, Lycopersicon, and Petota. As in all other studies including these groups, sections Etuberosum, Juglandifolia, Lycopersicoides, Lycopersicon, and Petota form a strongly supported clade. Solanum oxycoccoides, a high-elevation species endemic to north central Peru, was previously tentatively assigned to several groups within Solanum based on morphological evidence, but instead the species represents an independent lineage sister to the second major subclade. A key to the sections of the Potato clade is provided.
