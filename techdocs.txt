== Cartopy Recipes

Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.
Here are some recipes about how to do basic things since most of the examples found on the internet combine several
things, typically to the point of confusion.

== Virtual Environments and Software Package Managers

A listing of available virtual software environments such as conda, modules and software collections.
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated spaces for them that contain per-project dependencies for them.
Also listed are package managers such as easybuild, spack and nix, which are collections of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.
There is some overlap between the two concepts.
