== Updating Users in a Group

This assumes the group has already been created.
See the next section for how to create a group.

=== Grace

To modify a group on grace, log on to the management node:

-----
grace-mgt2.hprc.tamu.edu
-----

Become root via:

-----
sudo su -
-----

Go to the directory:

-----
cd /sw/hprc/local/etc/groups
-----

There is a brief explanation of the procedures in `00_README_HPRC`.  Here is an
expanded version of that file.

The information for each group is kept in a separate subdirectory in:

-----
/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups
-----

where the directory name is the net ID of the group's PI.
The group name is typically not the same as the net ID of the PI.
We will use the directory `pmorley` as an example, wherein we
find information about the `morley` group.

-----
/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/pmorley
-----

This directory contains the following files:

-----
gline.morley_group
morley_group
morley_group.NetID_to_FullName
RT30618
-----

*NOTE*:  If the ticket number is going to be supplied inside the group file, then
it's probably not necessary to repeat that information in another file like with
`RT30618` here.  I assume, however that the `@RT30618` line in the `morley_group` file
is an old way to do it that's been superseded by the `RT:` line found in 
the example in `00_README_HPRC`.

==== Modify the Group File

The `morley_group` file is the one to edit when adding and/or subtracting users.
After this file is initially created - in a process that differs from adding or subtracting
users - it looks like:

-----
# GID: 21922
# PI: pmorley (Paul Scott Morley)
# Note: group dir on Terra
pmorley
@RT30618

# begin RT44604 -- Mark 12/02/2022
ljpinnell
enriquedoster
mmmurphy
mcclurgmc
sctamm
jdyoung
sal
# end RT44603
-----

If we want to add a user, we edit this file and append, for example, the following
for user `anewuser`.

-----
# start RTNNNN, 12/04/2022 francis
anewuser
# end RTNNNN, 12/04/2022 francis
-----

where:

* `NNNNN` is the number of the ticket making the change request,
* `anewuser` is the NetID of the new user,
* `12/04/2022` is the date of the addition or removal of the user (in some understandable format), and
* `francis` is the name of whoever's making the changes

In the case of deleting an existing user, for instance the user we just added, we would edit the
previously appended section to look like:

-----
# start RTNNNN, 12/04/2022 francis
# anewuser - removed RTNNNN, 12/05/2022 steve
# end RTNNNN, 12/04/2022 francis
-----

where we place an `#` in front of the appropriate net ID and add the ticket number, date
and person performing the modification.

*NOTE*:  This is a suggested method for doing this.  The examples in `/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups` are all
over the place when it comes to deleting users.

The script that reads these configuration files only looks at the lines not starting with `#` to
decide which users are presently in the group after additions and/or substractions.

==== Update the `gline` File

Now create the `*.gline` file from the group file via:

-----
cd /sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/pmorley
/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/mkglines.sh
-----

In our example this will create the file `gline.morley_group` from the file `morley_group`.

==== Update the Distribution Group File

Then use the created `*.gline` file to update the distribution group file
`group.login`.

-----
/sw/local/sbin/update_group.sh gline.morley_group /adm/AMS/grace/distfiles/group.login
-----

=== Terra

These actions must be performed on the first terra management node.

-----
terra-mgt1.tamu.edu
-----

==== Copy the `gline` File to Terra

For terra the `*.gline` file created above must be (inconveniently) copied from grace to terra.
Using the previous example, we copy the `gline` file to the `/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups`
directory on `terra-mgt1` (for the sake of symmetry if nothing else).
This directory contains nothing other than a `README` file,
and can be purged of `gline` files after they've been processed.

-----
scp /sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/pmorley/gline.morley_group root@terra-mgt1.tamu.edu:/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups
-----

==== Update the Distribution Group File

Once it has been copied, run the following:

-----
cd /sw/hprc/local/etc/groups
/sw/local/sbin/update_group.sh gline.morley_group /general/adm/AMS/terra/distfiles/group.login
-----

Note that the absolute path of the `group.login` file on terra starts with a different
root level directory - i.e. `general` - than it does on grace.

=== FASTER

The processing on FASTER is done on the login node:

-----
faster-mgt1.hprc.tamu.edu
-----

==== ACCESS Accounts

For the XSEDE modifications, once the appropriate upstream processing has been completed the
following script is executed.

-----
/adm/AMS/bin/update_xsede_user_group_files.sh
-----

After this, the following script is executed:

-----
/adm/AMS/bin/syncaccts.cluster.briefly_tested_by_francis faster
-----

==== Group Accounts

The *gline* file must be copied from grace as with terra.
Running this will update the group accounts, and also the XSEDE accounts if the
previous script has been run.  This will update the group accounts, the XSEDE
accounts, or both, depending on what other scripts have been previously run.

-----
/adm/AMS/bin/syncaccts.cluster.briefly_tested_by_francis faster
-----

== Creating a Group

=== Creating a New Group ID Using a Net ID

A group must be added to a MySQL database on sandia to obtain a group ID number.

After logging on to sandia, become root via:

-----
sudo su -
-----

Next, bring up the MySQL command-line interface via:

-----
mysql --defaults-extra-file=~/.my.cnf.ams -Dams
-----

Once in, do the following to add the new group `mynewgroup` - where `mynewgroup` is
usually the net ID of the PI, although it can also be the name of a software package or
a name that's not a net ID - and then
to check that it has been created.  In this example
the new group ID number is `12345`.

-----
mysql> Insert into unix_logins (NetId) values ('mynewgroup');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)
mysql> select last_insert_id();
+------------------+
| last_insert_id() |
+------------------+
|            12345 | 
+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
-----

You can also check the correspondence between the group name/net ID and 
the group ID via:

-----
mysql> select * from unix_logins where NetId = 'mynewgroup';
+-------+----------+-----------+------------+
| Id    | PersonId | LoginName | NetId      |
+-------+----------+-----------+------------+
| 12345 |     NULL | NULL      | mynewgroup | 
+-------+----------+-----------+------------+
-----

=== Create a New Group Subdirectory and Initialization File

The group information is stored on grace in one of the following directories:

* `/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/PI_netid` - the preferred location if the PI will request multiple groups, with PI's net ID becoming
the directory name
* `/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/groupname`
* `/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/softwarename` - a location for groups based on limiting access to commercial software packages

Once you have created the appropriate directory, create a new group `new_group` in that directory.
This file name can be the net ID or something other than that.
The general strategy is that once you create that file you will run a script to create two other files from it, with
the three files looking like this:

-----
new_group
gline.new_group
new_group.NetID_to_FullName
-----

The `new_group` file will have the following format:

-----
# GID: 23073
# PI: raymundo.arroyave (Raymundo Arroyave)
# RT: N/A.  direct emails with Francis in Sep/Oct 2021.
# delegate: none yet

# start initial members (08oct2021 francis)
raymundo.arroyave
peter.morcos
xueq13
dehao.liu
# end start initial members (08oct2021 francis)

# EOF
-----

where the contents of the first section are the following:

* `GID` is the group ID number you created on sandia
* `PI` is the netID of the PI
* `RT` is the number of the ticket that requested the creation of a new group, or a brief explanation if it was not prompted by a ticket
* `delegate` - someone other than the PI who's been delegated to request group modifications

The next section is a list of the net IDs of those who will be the initial members of this group.
This is enclosed with `start` and `end` lines that include the date the group was created and the
person who created it.

=== Create the `gline` File from the Group File

A `gline.new_group` file is now created via:

-----
cd /sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/PI_netid
/sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/mkglines.sh
-----

=== Update the Distribution Group File

Once the `gline` file has been created, it is used to update the
distribution group file via:

-----
cd /sw/hprc/local/etc/groups/PI_netid
/sw/local/sbin/update_group.sh gline.new_group /adm/AMS/grace/distfiles/group.login
-----
