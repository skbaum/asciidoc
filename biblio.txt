If you're looking for Waldo, this is a significantly less good place to start.

The most useful book of the kind that has been published in the
English language, and to which we are greatly indebted in the preparation
of this work.  It comprises a summary account of the materials used for
writing in all ages and countries, the origin and progress of printing,
remarks on the forms of books, different styles of binding, the knowledge
of books, and the causes of their relative value and scarcity, the principles
which should govern in the arrangement and classification of a library, &c. &c.
The most extensive division of the work is appropriated to a notice of the
principal writers who have treated on the different branches of bibliography.
It contains the fullest account that we have ever seen of catalogues of
libraries both British and foreign.  The specimens of early typography, and
of the vignettes and monograms of the early printers, are neatly executed.  A
new edition of this work, incorporating the suggestions and improvements of
a later period, is greatly needed. - https://books.google.com/books?id=iA0GAAAAQAAJ[Guild]

*Preface*

The present Work contains a series of Observations on the different subjects, connected with Bibliography. It comprises,first, a summary account of the materials used for writing in different ages and countries: next in order succeed the origin and progress of writing and printing, the mechanism of the art, with comparative observations on the typographical execution of early printed books. This 
division is followed by remarks on the forms of books,—diferent styles of bookbinding in various ages,--the knowledge of books, and the causes of their relative value and scarcity, together with the best methods of preserving and repairing them. The principles, on which the classification (j a library should be conducted, are then explained, and illustrated by a copious system for its arrangement. The last and most extensive division of the work is appropriated to a notice of the principal writers, who have treated on the diflerent branches of Bibliography.

With regard to the engravings which are inserted, while the author hopes they will be found sufiicient for the purpose of elucidating his work, it were unjust not to notice the fidelity and spirit with which they have been executed by a young artist *, particularly the fac-similes of the Books of Images.

Throughout the ensuing pages, the author's object has been to compress as much as possible; many articles of lesser moment, therefore, have been omitted, for which ample materials had been collected. On the third part of the present work, he has bestowed most labour, being anxious that nothing of importance should be omitted: and in giving this list of works on Bibliography, such only have been inserted, as appeared to be principally deserving of attention from the Bibliographical Student. Each book, as far as was practicable, has been described from personal examination; and, where the author could not obtain access to it, either in his own limited collection, or in public libraries, he has availed himself of the labours of MM. Brunet, Cailleau, De Bure, Peig- Not, Renouard, Santander, the Rev. T. F. Dibdin, Dr. A. Clarke, and other Bibliographers, both British and Foreign. From their volumes, as well as from the principal literary Journals, he has been enabled to glean the various critical notices interspersed through the following pages: where particularly valuable, rare, or expensive works are to be found in our public libraries, especially in the Metropolis, care has been taken to indicate such library, noticing those chiefly which are the most easily accessible. 

Such is the work now offered to the acceptance of the Public, as an Introduction to the infant science of Bibliography. Precepts, indeed, the author does not pretend to give:—he merely suggests some practical hints for Students; at the same time, he ventures to indulge a hope, that his labours may be favourably received by every lover of books, as well as by the more experienced Bibliographer.

This work, the result of 25 years of research, is the first attempt at a complete and
systematic bibliography of bibliographies, and is to this day the most complete record of 
bibliographical work up to the year of its publication.  It is still valuable, not only as
a list, but for its critical and descriptive notes.  It is minutely classified, with full
author index. - https://books.google.com/books?id=vIJEAQAAIAAJ[Bibliographies of Bibliographies]

are treated with that minute attention to classification which is preeminently the
characteristic of the German mind, while our list is conspicuous for the
absence of any attempt at such as classification. - https://books.google.com/books?id=_A8CAAAAQAAJ[Sabin, 1877]

*Preface*

This brochure owes its existence to Mr. Power's Handy Book about Books, a large portion of which was reproduced in the American Bibliopolist. An examination of so much as Mr. Power had done on the subject of bibliography, led me to the conclusion that he had not made a personal examination of the books described, and that the eminent individuals, whom he thanks as having rendered him valuable assistance, must have had rather limited bibliographical resources; indeed, the general result was so disappointing that I determined to endeavor an improvement, and the result is the present list which is about four times the extent of Mr. Power's, and includes all the titles quoted by him, some of which we should have preferred to omit. Still it is not a complete bibliography, for the most excellent reason that such a work is beyond any one man's capacity; but it is hoped it will prove useful to those librarians and general readers who desire information concerning books about books.

Those who seek further information on the subject may consult with much advantage Petzholdt's Bibliotheca Bibliographica, which is conspicuous for the faithful and painstaking care exhibited in its compilation, and in which the titles are treated with that minute attention to classification which is preeminently the characteristic of the German mind, while our list is conspicuous for the absence of any attempt at such a classification.

I cannot close this brief notice without tendering my thanks to Mr. Charles A. Cutter of the Boston Athenaeum for his valuable aid. When librarians in general can approach his standard of library intelligence, there will cease to be that plentiful lack of knowledge by which some of them are now distinguished.

*Preface*

"In presenting this slight volume to those interested
in American bibliography, the author disclaims having had any intention to consider the subject beyond the limits of the field of American book-trade bibliography ; and even in that direction his efforts must be regarded as being merely tentative. Nevertheless, these field~farings, gathered by the author in his searches in out-oi-the-way and almost-forgotten places, for material for other purposes, may in time induce some more competent person to take up the subject in a more scientific manner, and to treat it as comprehensively as Mr. Henry Harrisse, for instance, has treated the subject of early American bibliography in the Introduction to his invaluable “ Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima.”

The author acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. Charles A. Montgomery, of Brooklyn, New York, for permitting his copy of the “ Catalogue of all the Books Printed in the United States . . . Published by the Booksellers in Boston . . . january, 1804," to be used in preparing the reprint of that curious and now practically unknown publication, which forms the second part of this volume. Only two other copies of the original catalogue are known to be in existence, of which one is in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the other is the property of Mr. James G Barnwell, of the Library Company of Philadelphia. As has been said elsewhere, though almost every canon of bibliographical science was ignored in the compilation of this catalogue, it may still be useful to collectors in determining the existence of early editions.  And as the earliest known attempt at trade bibliography in the United States it certainly will always have more than passing interest."

*Note*

A first attempt at recording a certain class of literature cannot be entirely successful. While completeness is not claimed for the present list, the compiler hopes that it may serve as a fairly reliable guide to bibliographical literature. Certain limitations have been placed on the work. Bibliographies published in periodical publications have been recorded only when they could be found without too laborious a search; chapters and parts of bibliographies dealing with general or special bibliography have not been included except in one or two cases which seemed specially important, and it has not been the intention to include lists of manuscript catalogues. Both fuller and more frequent notes and references to book reviews would have been desirable. Fear of making the pamphlet too bulky, as well as doubt as to his competence to make authoritative notes in all cases, and lack of time to search for the book reviews are offered by the compiler as reasons for their omission. Should a second edition be called for, it is hoped that these deficiencies may be remedied.

Wherever a book has been found in any Chicago library it has been personally examined and collated. Such titles are marked with a * before the running number. Some titles have been copied and collated at the New York State Library School at Albany. The compiler is also indebted for many courtesies to members of the staffs of the Newberry and Chicago Public Libraries, particularly to Mr. Carl B. Roden of the Public Library.

In the case of books not personally examined the size has been indicated by the standard form notations nearly universally used for this purpose in bibliographical work. But in the case of books collated by the compiler the actual measurements of the letter-press have been indicated in centimeters.

The total number of titles is 156, No. 109 being skipped in numbering.

This list of national bibliographies is a revision of two similar previous lists printed in 1900 and 1908 as Library School Bulletins 7 and 26. Like its predecessors, its primary purpose is to furnish an outline for the course in national bibliography offered in the New York State Library School.

The purpose of the list has necessarily led, in some cases, to rather arbitrary inclusions and exclusions. The complete destruction by fire in 1911 of the excellent collection on which the older lists were based has led to the omission of several titles which are either no longer available or which have been practically superseded by other books in the present collection of the New York State Library. The aim in general has been to limit the list to national bibliographies and to exclude subject bibliographies, which are treated in a separate course, but occasional exceptions have been made. Lists of government documents and periodicals are not included because dealt with in another course.

The list is merely representative and in no sense an attempt at completeness or a definitive selection of the best national bibliographies, though none have been included which are not useful and in some repute among bibliographers or booksellers. The sections on bibliographies of bibliography and general bibliography have been retained, the former in abridged form, and brief sections on Canadian, and Spanish American bibliography and a brief list of important bibliographies of incunabula have been added at the suggestion of librarians and library school instructors.

The national bibliographies of each country are arranged in rough chronological order according to the period covered by each work, i the bibliographical periodicals being placed last. The list prices f? of most of the later books are given and, in most cases, the approximate average auction or secondhand price of out-of-print books.

*Prefatory Note*

The accompanying list is designed primarily to serve as the basis of observations by the instructor and as a guide to the students in English 150 (Bibliography and Methods of English Literary History) in the Graduate School of the University of Chicago. It is hoped, however, that the material may prove useful to other investigators who, bewildered by a seeming multiplicity or nonplussed by an apparent absence of sources, labor under the delusion that the collection of bibliography is largely a matter of luck and that consequently it makes little difference where they begin. Special attention is therefore called to the Universal Bibliographies (section III), the Bibliographies of Bibliographies (section IV), the indexes and classified lists of books and articles (sections V-VI), and the bibliographies of dissertations (section IX). Students are urged to exhaust these general sources of information before following the desultory method frequently adopted even by otherwise respectable scholars.1 They are reminded that the most efficient investigator, by acquainting himself at the outset with previous collections of material .on his subject, avoids the necessity of repeating operations already performed by others, and spares himself the possible mortification of discovering at length by accident that the matter under discussion has already been adequately treated and that therefore his labor has been in vain.

In order to avoid confusing the beginner by a multitude of references, the compiler has included only a few of the most useful or comprehensive sources. Although the choice has generally been restricted to books and articles which are strictly bibliographical or contain bibliographical features and which deal with English literature, a number of works not usually included in bibliographies of English literature have been introduced because they furnish information on subjects which are allied to English and which sometimes demand the attention of the literary investigator at a time when he has little bibliographical information outside his special territory. It should be added, however, that the lists of special bibliographies and treatises given in sections XI, XIII, and XIV are not intended to dispense with the consultation of the general repertories enumerated in sections III-VI and IX. For the sake of convenience the literature of America has been classified separately. The list is followed by an index of the most important entries.

'"Sans doute, on arrive peu a peu, de soi-meme, a s'initier au maniement des principaux repertoires, . . . mais ce n'est jamais sans tatonnements ni sans deboires, et il est rare que la science, acquise ainsi de pieces et de morceaux, soit integrate" (Charles-V. Langlois, Manuel de bibliographic historique [2. ed., Paris, 1901], I, viii f.).

"The Libro de los Epítomes manuscript, which is more than a foot thick, contains more than 2,000 pages and summaries from the library of Hernando Colón, the illegitimate son of Christopher Columbus who made it his life’s work to create the biggest library the world had ever known in the early part of the 16th century. Running to around 15,000 volumes, the library was put together during Colón’s extensive travels. Today, only around a quarter of the books in the collection survive and have been housed in Seville Cathedral since 1552.

...

The manuscript was found in the collection of Árni Magnússon, an Icelandic scholar born in 1663, who donated his books to the University of Copenhagen on his death in 1730. The majority of the some 3,000 items are in Icelandic or Scandinavian languages, with only around 20 Spanish manuscripts, which is probably why the Libro de los Epítomes went unnoticed for hundreds of years.

...

After amassing his collection, Colón employed a team of writers to read every book in the library and distill each into a little summary in Libro de los Epítomes, ranging from a couple of lines long for very short texts to about 30 pages for the complete works of Plato, which Wilson-Lee dubbed the “miracle of compression”.

Because Colón collected everything he could lay his hands on, the catalogue is a real record of what people were reading 500 years ago, rather than just the classics. “The important part of Hernando’s library is it’s not just Plato and Cortez, he’s summarising everything from almanacs to news pamphlets. This is really giving us a window into the entirety of early print, much of which has gone missing, and how people read it – a world that is largely lost to us,” said Wilson-Lee.

Wilson-Lee and Pérez Fernández are currently working on a comprehensive account of the library, which will be published in 2020. They are also working to digitise the manuscript, in collaboration with the Arnamagnæan Institute." - https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/10/extraordinary-500-year-old-library-catalogue-reveals-books-lost-to-time-libro-de-los-epitomes[Alison Flood]

*Bibliotheca Vniuersalis, siue Catalogus omnium scriptorum locupletissimus, in tribus linguis, Latina, Graeca, & Hebraica* (1545, no pagination) - Conrad Gesner

*****
Conrad Gessner (/ˈɡɛsnər/; Latin: Conradus Gesnerus; German: Conrad Geßner [ˈɡɛsnər] or Cůnrat Geßner;[2][a] 26 March 1516 – 13 December 1565) was a Swiss physician, naturalist, bibliographer, and philologist. Born into a poor family in Zürich, Switzerland, his father and teachers quickly realised his talents and supported him through university, where he studied classical languages, theology and medicine. He became Zürich's City Physician, but was able to spend much of his time on collecting, research and writing. Gessner compiled monumental works on bibliography (Bibliotheca universalis 1545–1549) and zoology (Historia animalium 1551–1558) and was working on a major botanical text at the time of his death from plague at the age of 49. He is regarded as the father of modern scientific bibliography, zoology and botany. He was frequently the first to describe a species of plant or animal in Europe, such as the tulip in 1559. A number of plants and animals have been named after him.

In 1545, after four years of research, Gessner published his remarkable Bibliotheca universalis,[19] an exhaustive catalogue of all known works in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, of all writers who had ever lived, with the titles of their works, and brief annotations. The work, which included his own bio-bibliography, listed some three thousand authors alphabetically, and was the first modern bibliography published since the invention of printing, Through it, Gessner became known as the "father of bibliography." In, all, about twelve thousand titles were included.

A second part, a thematic index to the work, Pandectarum sive partitionum universalium libri xxi,[32] appeared in 1548. Although the title indicated that twenty one parts were intended, only nineteen books were included. Part 20, intended to include his medical work, was never finished and part 21, a theological encyclopaedia, was published separately in 1549.

"John Bale (21 November 1495 – November 1563) was an English churchman, historian and controversialist, and Bishop of Ossory. He wrote the oldest known historical verse drama in English (on the subject of King John), and developed and published a very extensive list of the works of British authors down to his own time, just as the monastic libraries were being dispersed. His unhappy disposition and habit of quarrelling earned him the nickname "bilious Bale".

Some view Bale's most important work as being Illustrium majoris Britanniae scriptorum, hoc est, Angliae, Cambriae, ac Scotiae Summarium... ("A Summary of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, that is, of England, Wales and Scotland") published at Ipswich and Wesel for John Overton in 1548, and 1549.[9] This contained authors through five centuries: however, another edition, almost entirely rewritten and containing fourteen centuries, was printed at Basel with the title Scriptorum illustrium majoris Britanniae...Catalogus ("Catalogue of the Famous Writers of Great Britain") in 1557–1559.

This chronological catalogue of British authors and their works was partly founded on the De uiris illustribus of John Leland. Bale was an indefatigable collector and worker, and personally examined many of the valuable libraries of the Augustinian and Carmelite houses before their dissolution. His work contains much information that would otherwise have been hopelessly lost. His autograph note-book is preserved in the Selden Collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It contains the materials collected for his two published catalogues arranged alphabetically, without enlargement on them nor the personal remarks which colour the completed work. He includes the sources for his information.[10] He noted: "I have bene also at Norwyche, our second citye of name, and there all the library monuments are turned to the use of their grossers, candelmakers, sopesellers, and other worldly occupyers... As much have I saved there and in certen other places in Northfolke and Southfolke concerning the authors names and titles of their workes, as I could, and as much wold I have done throughout the whole realm, yf I had been able to have borne the charges, as I am not." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bale[Wikipedia]

*****
*Preface*

"John Bale's autograph notebook, preserved among Selden's manuscripts in the Bodleian Library \ has been long known and often used by editors of mediaeval texts. It is a carefully planned catalogue of British (and a few foreign) writers, differing from Bale's published Catalogues2 in two important respects. First, it is arranged alphabetically, not chronologically. Secondly, by far the greater number of the articles are followed by a reference to the authority or source from which their matter is derived. The other differences between the notebook and the two Catalogues need not be here examined> The earlier Catalogue contains much fewer names, and the later is drawn out altogether on an ampler scale; but the distinguishing characteristic of the notebook is that it contains the materials which Bale collected, written out with much pains, but with far less attempt at literary embellishment than is the case with his published Catalogues. It is seldom, for instance, that Bale here displays that virulent scurrility which has given him a bad name among controversialists of the baser sort. He appears in this notebook primarily as a zealous collector of materials at a date when materials were accessible which in a few years more were scattered and largely lost.

It has seemed evidently desirable that this notebook, which bears no title (except the words De Scriptoribus Angliae on the modern back of the
binding1), should be given a name to distinguish it from the two / Catalogues which Bale himself printed ; and I have adopted the title Index Britanmae Scriptorum with slight modification from the heading of the alphabetical index in which the compiler brought together the scattered entries in his book (f. 220), for its alphabetical system was disturbed, as will be seen hereafter, through several causes. The colophon to that index (f. 233 b) has supplied me with a half-title.

...

The design of the present edition has been to print the whole of Bale's alphabetical catalogue, together with such portions of his supplementary matter as seemed to possess substantial value. The following is a table of the contents of the volume, exclusive of the catalogue itself. It does not include articles inserted irregularly (such as a name ranked under a prefixed Frater or the like, or surnames to which Bale has subsequently attached a Christian name), which have of course been transferred to their proper places in the alphabet, nor articles which are entered in their alphabetical order with a cross-reference to the place where they are printed; but it does include articles inserted altogether out of order or in a place where they could not possibly be expected to appear. The portions which have not been inserted in the edition are printed in italics.

*Bibliotheke tou Photiou* (1601, 963) - Ier Photius and Höschel

*****
Photios I (Greek: Φώτιος Phōtios), (c. 810/820 – 6 February 893), a[›] also spelled Photius[2] (/ˈfoʊʃəs/) or Fotios, was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 858 to 867 and from 877 to 886;[3] He is recognized in the Eastern Orthodox Church as Saint Photios the Great.

Photios is widely regarded as the most powerful and influential church leader of Constantinople subsequent to John Chrysostom's archbishopric around the turn of the fifth century. He is also viewed as the most important intellectual of his time – "the leading light of the ninth-century renaissance".[4] He was a central figure in both the conversion of the Slavs to Christianity and the Photian schism,[5] and is considered "[t]he great systematic compiler of the Eastern Church, who occupies a similar position to that of Gratian in the West," and whose "collection in two parts...formed and still forms the classic source of ancient Church Law for the Greek Church."

The most important of the works of Photios is his renowned Bibliotheca or Myriobiblon, a collection of extracts and abridgements of 280 volumes of classical authors (usually cited as Codices), the originals of which are now to a great extent lost. The work is especially rich in extracts from historical writers. 

To Photios, we are indebted for almost all we possess of Ctesias, Memnon of Heraclea, Conon, the lost books of Diodorus Siculus, and the lost writings of Arrian. Theology and ecclesiastical history are also very fully represented, but poetry and ancient philosophy are almost entirely ignored. It seems that he did not think it necessary to deal with those authors with whom every well-educated man would naturally be familiar. The literary criticisms, generally distinguished by keen and independent judgment, and the excerpts vary considerably in length. The numerous biographical notes are probably taken from the work of Hesychius of Miletus.

*Preface*

It is proposed to issue the present translation of the Bibliotheca of Photius in five volumes; a sixth will contain an account of his life and works, a Bibliography, and a General Index to the whole.

A translator of the Bibliotheca has apparently an open field. So far as can be ascertained, no complete version exists in English or any other modern language, although there are English translations or editions of some of the longer extracts (e.g. Ctesias' Indica), of some of the literary criticisms, of selected codices (chiefly on profane authors) in Italian by G. Compagnoni, a well-known Milanese literary man and statesman (1754-1834), and of the whole in Latin by the learned Jesuit Andreas Schott3 in Migne's Patrologia Graeca (vol. ciii.).

The text is unfortunately in many places unsatisfactory, and no critical edition has been attempted for nearly a hundred years—since 1824, the date of Immanuel Bekker's edition. The nature of the work, a sort of enlarged table of contents, often leaves the meaning and connexion obscure, when there exist no complete texts s or other means of supplementing it.

The present translator, in the endeavour to obtain as satisfactory a rendering as possible, has constantly consulted the most important literary, theological, and historical works and encyclopaedias bearing on the wide field covered by the extensive reading of Photius. Naturally, there is little scope for elegance of translation, and in the literary criticisms it is by no means easy to find a correct and adequate English equivalent for the terms used.

In the matter of notes, the number of personal and geographical names, of historical allusions, is so large that any attempt to deal with them at length would have swamped the text and reduced it to a kind of peg on which to hang a miniature encyclopaedia. In the case of persons familiar to all only a brief note has been given, sufficient for the purposes of identification (often necessary where there are several persons of the same name), so that those desirous of further information should know for whom to look in the usual biographical and other dictionaries. In the case of names less familiar and points arising directly from the text, the details given are somewhat fuller. In the Bibliography a list of the most useful general works of reference and of special editions or accounts of the authors criticised in the Bibliotheca will be given. The present work makes no claim to contain a complete exegetical or critical commentary, but is a somewhat free translation intended to give the ordinary reader an idea of the literary activity of the chief representative of the so-called Byzantine Renaissance.

"FAWNE (LUKE), bookseller in London; Parrot in St. Pauls Churchyard, 1631-66. Took up his freedom March 26th, 1629. [Arber, iii. 687.] In partnership for some time with Robert Dawlman at the Brazen Serpent in St. Paul's Churchyard. Afterwards set up for himself at the sign of the Parrot. Dealt exclusively in works of divinity and was a strong supporter of the Presbyterian party. In 1652, in conjunction with five other booksellers, he published a pamphlet entitled A Beacon set on fire or the humble information of certain booksellers stationers of London, to the Parliament & Commonwealth of England. In this attention was directed to the Popish books that had been printed of late years, and to other books favoured by the Independents. The Independents replied with The Beacons Quenched, while Michael Sparke, q.v., published on his own account A Second Beacon fired by Scintilla. These pamphlets were the object of much satire in the news-sheets of the time." - https://archive.org/details/adictionarybook00plomgoog/page/n11[Henry R. Plomer]

"An excellent edition, the Bibliotheca Fetus being enriched with notes by Perez Bayer, a learned Valencian, the Bibliotheca Nova receiving additions from Antonio's own manuscripts, that bring down his notices of Spanish writers to the time of his death in 1684. In the earlier portion, embracing the names of about 1,300 authors, little remains to be desired. The latter portion contains notices of nearly 8,000 writers—it is a monument of industry, firmness, and fidelity. The two, taken together, constitute their author beyond all reasonable question, the father and founder of the literary history of his country."—T1cknor, 1. 218. Further details concerning this will be found in Dibdin's Bibliomania and Sabin's Dictionary, Vol. 1. 226-227.

*Annales typographici ab anno M.D. ad annum M.D.XXXVI. continuati: Tomi secundi pars prior (7 Vol.)* (1719-1789) - Michael Mattaire

*****
Volume I. from the origin of the art to the year 1500, was published in 1719.  Volume II. 1500-1536,
was published in 1722, in 2 parts.  Volume III. 1536-1557, was published in 1726, in 2 parts, with
an appendix.  Volume IV, from the origin of the arts to 1664, was published in 1733, in 2 parts.
Volume V, containing a general index, was published in 1741, in 2 parts.  Complete copies of
these annals, with both parts of the index, are are, especially in this country.
The supplement by Michael Denis, published at Vienna in 1789, in 2 volumes, contains 6311
articles, describing works printed in the 15th century, which were unknown to Mattaire.

Though less perfect in some respects than the annals of Panzer, it is
nevertheless indispensable in every bibliographical collection.  It does not
confine itself like that work to mere nomenclature, but gives information 
respecting the lives of printers, publishers, correctors of the press, and literary
men, and suggests inquiries respecting the history of the art of printing.
The author was a native of London, born in 1668, and educated at
Westminster School and Oxford University. - https://books.google.com/books?id=iA0GAAAAQAAJ[Guild]

*Bibliothèque curieuse historique et critique ou Catalogue raisonné de livres difficiles à trouver [Curious and Critical Historical Library or Catalog of Difficult Books to Find]* (1750-1760) - David Clement

*****
This work is compiled upon a very extensive plan, for, though consisting of nine
quarto volumes, it comes down no farther than to the letter H in the alphabetical
arrangement of names; terminating here in consequence of the author's death.
It is beautifully printed and exhibits great labour and learning.  The following
are the different classes mentioned in which books may be said to be
rare.  1. A book which is difficult to find in the country where it is sought, ought
to simply be called rare.  2.  A book which is difficult to find in any
country may be called very rare.  3.  A book of which there are only 50 or
60 copies existing, or which appears as seldom as if there never had been
more at any time than that number of copies, ranks as extremely rare.
4.  When the whole number of copies of a work does not exceed 10,
this constitutes excessive rarity, or rarity in the highest degree.  This
classification of the degrees of rareness is copied from Clement by all subsequent
writers in this department. - https://books.google.com/books?id=iA0GAAAAQAAJ[Guild]

"A sine qua non with collectors; but in this country it begins to be - to use the
figurative language of some of the German bibliographers - 'scarcer  than a white crow
or a black swan.' The reader may admit which simile he pleases, or reject both! but
in sober earnestness is is very rare and unconscionably dear." - Dibdin.  Per
contra, it usually sells very cheap.  One copy of was printed on large paper. - https://books.google.com/books?id=ye4QAAAAIAAJ[Sabin]

remarks: "The execution of this work does honour to the Spanish press.  The MSS.,
to the number of 1851, are judiciously classified by the Editor, and his copious

*Origines typographicae (2 Vol.)* (1865) - Gerardus Meerman

*****
One of the most instructive books extant, as to the progress of the art, and
full of learned and acute inquiries.  The author, who was a distinguished lawyer of
Leyden, supports with great ardour the pretensions of Harlem as the birthplace
of the art, and of Lawrence Coster as its inventor.  Although the hypothesis of
Meerman in support of these pretensions has long since been exploded as a fable, the
work is highly esteemed and eagerly fought after by bibliographers.  The plates (12 in number)
are frequently taken out to illustrate other works. - https://books.google.com/books?id=iA0GAAAAQAAJ[Guild]

This is perhaps the most laborious and most able bibliographical work which has ever

*Sciagraphia historiae literariae Islandicae, autorum et scriptorum tum editorum tum ineditorum indicem exhibens* (1777, 251) - Halfdan Einarsson

*****
This work "contains information that is not to be found in any of the former
accounts of this country; and the author has drawn together in a small compass
materials of consequence, that are scattered in a great number of volumes.
The ancient and modern language of the Icelanders - their poets before and
after the reformation - their historians posterior to that period - their natural
philosophers, mathematicians, physicians, and moralists, their writers in political
and rural economy - their jurists and theologians, are the subjects treated in this
work, in six chapters.  Each chapter is followed by a table, in which the authors
are ranged alphabetically, according to their Christian names, as is usual
among Icelanders: we find also in this table the principal circumstances of the
life of each writer, the editions of his works, and some anecdotes that
are interesting and well attested." (Monthly Review, O.S. vol. lix. p. 459) - https://books.google.com/books?id=20q5AAAAIAAJ[Home]

*Preface*

"As the nature of this Work, and the sources whence it has been derived, will be fully explained in the Bibliographical Essay, it is not necessary to occupy these pages with any detailed account of that part which is now presented to the Reader. Great pains and labour have been taken to make it what it is; and yet it is very far from what it should be.—A perfect work of this kind never yet saw the sun; and perhaps in Bibliography especially perfection is unattainable.

The Origin of the Art of Printing is, like the birthplace of Homer, enveloped in absolute obscurity. The history of important works is often in the same state; and the discordancy of Bibliographers, and the confusion of dates and places, are endless.

It is not the province of the present work to settle these differences.—To furnish the student and the scholar with a portable and useful alphabetical Manual, which may assist them in the choice of Books, condensing the most important information of numerous bibliographical works, is the Editor's intention. If he have succeeded in any tolerable degree, it is what he ardently wished, and for which he earnestly laboured.

In the compilation of this work, besides innumerable collections from sale Catalogues, (though in such a work necessary auxiliaries, yet the worst guides both with respect to titles and dates) the best bibliographical authorities have been consulted and followed: the chief of which are—Le Long's Bibliotheca Sacra, by Boerner and Masch..1778..90—Maittaike's Anmles Typographici, 1733—Vogt's Catalogue Historico-Criticus, 173S —Marchant's Histoire de VOrigine et des premiers Progres de 1'Imprimeris, 1740—Debure's Bibliographic Instructive, 1763—Meerman's Origines Typographic ce, 176.5—Osmont's Dictionnaire Typographiqus, Historiqus, et Critique des Livres rares, 1768—the Abbe MerCier's Supplement to Marchant's Histoire de VOrigine, &c. 1775—Bowyer's Origin of Printing, 1776—De Rossi's Apparatus Biblicus,
1782—Denis's Supplement to the Annates Typographic of Maittaire, 1789—CailLeau's Dictionnaire Typographique, &c. 1792—PanZer's Annales Typographic^ 1793—Heinsius's Allgeincines Eiiclier Lexicon, 1793—1798, &c. &c.

To some this work may appear too diffuse; to others, too contracted; and some may think, that only select Editions should have been inserted. To every respectable objector on these or any other grounds, it may with due deference be said, that the Editor endeavoured earnestly to please every man, though he felt no satisfactory hope that he should succeed. His chief aim has been to insert useful and important articles, together with whatever he knew to be curious and scarce. Had he indeed consulted his own judgment only, he would have inserted fewer Editions of Greek and Latin Classics: the rage, as it is termed, for collecting these, he thinks useless, and ridiculous in the extreme.

To this volume is added, a Fac Simile (taken from Meerman's Origines Typographical) of Coster's HORARIUM, supposed to be the first essay at Printing in Europe. Critics agree, that this small tract, which contains only the Alphabet, the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed» and three short Prayers, was executed with moveable •We viooden types, about the year 1430.—See Horarium. If the leaves according to the paging, be pasted back to back, the curious will then have a perfect Fac Simile of Coster's Book. A few copies have been taken off on vellum, to make the work as complete a copy of the original as possible.

Notwithstanding the copious information already given concerning the Lcmdon Polyglott, an Appendix has been thought necessary: and as the materials for it came to hand since the printing of the preceding sheets, it is necessarily referred to the succeeding Volume. As this work is such a monument to the honour of the religion and literature of this nation as no other country can boast of in its own behalf, the Editor hopes he has little need to apologize to his countrymen for communicating in detail his researches on this subject.

The biographical Anecdotes which are interspersed through this work, are taken chiefly from the Nouveau Dictionnaire Historique; seventh Edition; Lyons, 1789; and the critical Judgments, from too many quarters to be distinctly specified.

Those who have the smallest acquaintance with the difficulty of compiling such a work as the present, will not be surprised to meet with several mistakes, and will not be hasty in censuring. In so many thousands of dates, places, and prices, these are unavoidable. The chief of those already noticed are the following; which the candid Reader will find no difficulty to excuse, and not much labour to correct. The succeeding Volumes, it is hoped, will have less cause to claim the public indulgence on this head."

*Preface*

"AFTER considerable delays which could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, the Bibliographical Miscellany is at last completed. Great care and much pains have been taken to make it as nearly as possible, what the Editor designed it should be, a correct and useful work. How he has executed his task, must be left to his intelligent Readers to judge, from whose candor he bespeaks indulgence for whatever errors or imperfections they may discover.

The subjects he has introduced, he considers to be all very intimately allied to the Science of Bibliography, and on each of them he has enendeavoured to condense as much information as possible. Other matters which had been prepared for the press, might have been also inserted, had the compass of the work admitted; but those which appear, were judged to have a more intimate connexion with the subject than those which he was obliged to omit.

A Synopsis of the work in this place, cannot be deemed foreign to the design of an Introduction, as it will render an index or table of contents unnecessary.

As the Editor wished to produce the subjects of
his work in a sort of regular, graduated order, he has endeavoured to mark Cause and Effect, and bring forward those things first, which, in the order of time and invention, have the precedence. Hence, the following arrangement of his materials.

1. Introductory Remarks concerning the brigin of Language and Alphabetical Characters, p. 1–6.: On this subject no indulgence is asked for the opinion that attributes rational speech and alphabetical writing to God. Great and wise, men have adopted and defended a different opinion : every reader will of course receive that which: appears to him most probable and rational: this, is what the Editor has done,— . . - Hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim. . . He found it reasonable to attribute every good and perfect gift to HIM who is the fountain of excellence and Father of lights; nor can he see
any gifts from the God of Nature to his intelligent
offspring, more perfect in their kind, or more
beneficial in their operation and tendency, than
those already referred to.

2. A short history of the origin of Printing, and of the first inventors of this Art, p. 7–47. Taken principally from the Quadro Critico-Tipograffco, of the Abbé Mauro Boni: this excellent treatise notices among other matters, the causes of the errors in the history of Typography. —Origin and progress of Printing in Germany— Introduction and perfection of the Art in Italy.—
Defence of the date of the celebrated Decor Puel LARUM, printed at Venice by Nicholas Jenson, in which all the objections against the genuineness of the date, 1641, are fully met, fairly considered and amply confuted. In the hands of this able Bibliographer, this one circumstance has tended to diffuse much light over the amazingly obscure history of Typography.

3. A catalogue of Authors alphabetically arranged, who have illustrated the history of Literature, Chronology, Bibliography, and Typography; divided into four classes, p. 48–87. 1st Class. Writers on Literary and Chronological History. 2d Class. Authors of Typographical Annals, general and particular. 3d Class. General and particular Bibliographical Catalogues. 4th Class. Critical Dissertations on Ancient Typography. The writers on each of these classes are arranged in alphabetical order for the greater conveniency of reference; and their works, in their first and improved editions, distinctly noticed, with critical judgments on each. Much of the imformation under these heads has been collected from the Biblioteca Portatile of Messrs. Boni, and Gamba. If these writers appear partial to their own land (Italy) and its literary productions, every reader of taste will forgive any excess of glorying in behalf of a country which has been successively the mother, the nurse, and refuge of Literature, Sciences, and Arts. The classica reader cannot forget the Roman Poets and Historians who
have been the sweetest companions of his youth : and the Historian and Chronologist will remember with gratitude, that when the Greek Empire was destroyed by the Turks, its learned men and its literature proscribed, Italy opened her fostering bosom and afforded a place of refuge and rest to those eminent Grecian Philologists, who, escaping from the ruins of their own country, and the ruthless barbarians who had deluged it with their desolating legions, brought with them their choicest literary treasures, and poured them out with a liberal hand over the land of their benefactors. It was in consequence of this that Italy acquired such a dignified preeminence among the nations of Europe, as the sword will for ever be in vain unsheathed to produce.

4. An Alphabetical List of all the Cities and Towns where Printing was established in the fif. teenth Century, p. 88–131. Under this head are given their Latin names as they stand in the imprints of the books to which they are affixed.— Their modern names, with a short geographical description.—The title, size, and date, of the first book printed in each place, with the Printer's name, and the name of his most distinguished succeSS07 S. . This List has cost the Editor more trouble than any other part of the work; and the utmost care has been taken to make it as correct and perfect as possible. The materials are chiefly
collected from Maittaire, Marchand, Mercier, Messrs. Boni and Gamba, Tiraboschi and Panzer. To ascertain the modern names of some of the places was found very difficult: and in a few, a probable conjecture was, the utmost the editor could arrive at. In such cases Gazetteers and similar authorities have been resorted to in vain.

5. To this succeeds a SUPPLEMENT of Towns and Cities where Printing has been estabfished since the fifteenth centuay, p. 132–145. This part might have been much enlarged, but it was not judged indispensably necessary. As the most difficult names are here explained, which usually occur in the titles of books, the residue it is hoped will occasion little embarrassment to any scholar. In the previous list, great care has been taken not to omit one place where printing was carried on prior to the year 1500. It may be necessary to observe, for the information of the less experienced reader, that in this Supplement, as the Latin name stands in reference to no printed work, the nominative case has been always used; but in the preceding list because the name refers to the work executed there, the genitive case has been retained. Panzer in his list has followed the same plan. This will be of some use to the mere English scholar, as he will at once see the same form of the word in its alphabetical order, in this list, which he finds in the title of his book.

6. The Essay on Bibliography, or Treatise concerning the knowledge and love of Books, their scarcity, method of arrangement, &c. p. 146–197, is principally taken from De Bure, as improved and re-edited by Cailleau ; with some retrenchments and several notes and enlargements by the present Editor. To have done this part as much justice as was requisite, would have required more room than could be spared in this volume.

7. At the close of this Essay, are found two Bibliographical Systems, p. 198—218, the first, that of Mr. Arsenne Thiebaut, and the second, that of Mr. Peignot, taken from the Dictionnaire raisonée de Bibliologie. It is not expected that either of these systems will exactly suit the taste of any collector of books: but they will certainly afford ample materials from which the judicious reader may form a system to his own mind. It is rather as a help than as a pattern that they are here introduced.

8. As Epochs and Æras are so often introduced in Literature in general, and in Bibliography in particular, a short account is given of them page 219–223, which is succeeded by a Table of the Olympiads and Athenian Archons; the first Olympiad commencing in the 3938th year of the
Julian Period, 776 years before the Incarnation of Christ. The Table itself is carried down to the 250th Olympiad, which answers to the year of our Lord 220. Each Olympiad is distinguished by its successive years, the conqueror at the publie games and the most remarkable transactions which occurred during its revolution, p. 22.4— 274. In this the Abbé Du Fresnoy's Chronolo-. gical Tables, have been principally followed, but they have been corrected and enlarged from the Series Chronologica Olympiadum, &c. of Dr. Lloyd. This, it is hoped will be deemed a valuable acquisition by scholars in general, who have not the advantage of large libraries. It may be necessary to note that the years before and after our Lord, are regularly connected in a collateral column with the years of the Olympiads.

9. A Table of the Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Athenian, Macedonian and Roman months has been added, p. 275. The Roman calendar is also produced at large, and the Calends, Nones, Ides, Nundinal Letters, &c. distinctly marked in each month, with suitable directions, p. 276– 290. In reading' ancient authors, Greek and Latin MSS. Bulls, Diplomas, and other acts, these tables will be found peculiarly useful. Without such helps it is impossible to ascertain the times of particular facts, and verify the dates which appear but obscurely in MSS., official acts of councils, &c. &c.

10. Next follows an ample account of the Hijrah or Mohammedan Ara, from its commencement A. D. 622, continued down to its 1627th year, which corresponds with the 2200th year of the Christian IEra, p. 291—313. The years of these two aras are so disposed in the
Tables, that the reader will discover at one glance, what year of the Hijrah answers to a given year of our Lord, and vice versa. To all readers of Oriental History, Arabic and Persian MSS. these Tables will be found essentially necessary, as in such works, the years of the Hijrah are those alone which are followed, and all facts, writings, &c. dated from them.

11. The volume concludes with a Chronological Series of the Khaliffs, or successors of Mohammed—the Kings of Persia, and the Mohammedan Princes who have reigned in Hindostan from the commencement of the Hijrah to the present time, p. 31.4—3.23. These also will be found peculiarly serviceable in reading oriental history in general, and Arabic and Persian MSS. in particular."

"If ever there were a time when I might wish for the unclouded use of my faculties, and to be divested of all prejudice and passion, it would surely be the present. I am about to give an account of a work which was commenced under the most auspicious prospects, with. the most favourable hopes of its successful and protracted continuation, with the best possible means to give it every aid of variety, with the opportunity of choice among almost infinite materials; and finally, with every thing I could possibly desire to cheer the present, and to animate me to future exertion.

My situation at the conclusion of these two volumes is very different. But I hasten to give the following concise account of the matter.

Having, as I may presume to affirm, led an irreproachable life in my profession, and having manifested my Literary diligence by my versions of Herodotus and Aulus Gellius, and by various other works, I had the good fortune to number among my friends and protectors, some of the most eminent, and some of the most estimable characters of my country. These, I am proud to say, still remain—I have not lost one.

A few years since, the venerable and learned Prelate, to whom these volumes, with his permission, are inscribed, and who has invariably demonstrated a warm and friendly zeal towards Literature and its disciples, asked me if I should wish for a situation ation in the British Museum. It was the thing of all others I most wished. It had long been the great object of my ambition. I knew and esteemed almost all its members; and from long and familiar acquaintance with books, I conceived myself to possess the necessary qualifications for the office of a Librarian.

I was at that time at the head of a respectable institution, and in the enjoyment of no contemptible emolument. However, when the vacancy of Under Librarian happened at the Museum, by the death of Mr. Harper, I applied, under the sanction of the Bishop of Durham's recommendation, and received my appointment, regularly signed by the late Archbishop of Canterbury, the late Lord Chancellor Eldon, and the Right Hon. Charles Abbott, the Speaker of the late House of Commons.

How I conducted myself in this situation I may fairly challenge the most rigid investigation to determine. I appeal to my brother officers; I appeal to every one connected with that institution, to decide; I appeal to that part of the public who knew and observed me in the execution of my office. I conceived it my duty, and I felt it my delight, to assist and facilitate the researches of the learned, to gratify the ingenuous curiosity of strangers, and to exhibit, where the recommendation justified confidence, the sources of instruction and amusement which were committed to my care. But this I did not conceive to be sufficient; I thought that the public might not unreasonably expect more.

As my office, therefore, confined me to the care and examination of printed books, I formed the determination of selecting such as were more extraordinary for their intrinsic
value, or sought after for their rarity, and I undertook, from time to time, to give such a description of them and their content?, as might be interesting and useful both to the Student and Collector. I thought I should perform no unimportant office in communicating to the Student the place where he might find what he wanted, and in representing to the Collector the genuine marks by which he might ascertain the object of his curious pursuit.

The Museum contains great treasures of this kind, and most particularly in old English Literature, which had ever been a favourite branch of my occasional investigation, and which I knew, at this particular time, to be an object of very earnest research. Such was the foundation, and such the motive of my commencing the present undertaking. But on announcing my plan and design among my Literary
friends, I had the satisfaction of discovering that my ideas were
generally approved, and I almost immediately received such countenance and assistance, that I was not only confirmed in my determination, but induced to believe that I should be able to produce a Miscellaneous Volume once in every year.

...

But to come to the contents of these volumes. It is very possible that the expectations of many may be disappointed, and that looking for what they will not find, they may throw aside the book with displeasure. But let it be remembered, what alone I have pledged myself to do, namely, to give a description of such rare and curious books as might happen to fall in my way; with such occasional Anecdotes of Literature, interspersed, as might happen to occur to my recollection or reading.—I pretended not to give elaborate observations or critical disquisitions, but merely to point out to collectors and curious students, books known to be fare, and, as such, valuable. I have, however, endeavoured so to diversify the position, and the quality of my materials, that whilst I trust the scholar need not turn away in disgust, the Miscellaneous reader may find various sources of amusement."

* *Bibliomania, or Book Madness* (1842, 681) - https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9eQJe5X8EC[+https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9eQJe5X8EC+]

*****
This edition was undertaken by Mr. Walmsly.  It contains a key to the characters, etc.,
and a supplement, edited by Dr. Dibdin himself.  The copies on large paper, imp. 8vo,
have title-pages for two volumes.

"The 'Bibliomania' is written in dialogues or conversations, the characters
introduced are well-known book collectors of the author's acquantance.  The
great value of the work is in the notes, which abound with anecdotes of books
and book collectors, and an account of the rarer articles in their collections,
and the prices at which they were sold, extracted from the sale catalogues.  It
will be always consulted as an authority." - Lowndes

"The 'Bibliomania' is evidently formed in the first instance on the plan of honest
Isaac Walton's 'Complete Angler'; with conspicuous marks of the author's
being deeply versed in the 'Battle of the Books', and a familiar acquaintance
with old English literature, and occasionally with the discussions of Yorick.
Under the shape of dramatic dialogue, the reader is equally entertained and
instructed; the abstruser parts, with the historical details, being thrown into
the form of notes.  It would now be useless ot pass on encomium on this work,
as its merits are so fully established as to have more than doubled
the original price of a volume now with difficulty to
be obtained." - Gent's. Magazine

"You have contrived to strew flowers over a path which, in other hands, would
have proved a very dull one; and all Bibliomanes must remember you long,
as he who first united their antiquarian details with good-humored
raillery and cheerfulness." - Sir Walter Scott to Dr. Dibdin - https://books.google.com/books?id=_A8CAAAAQAAJ[Sabin]

The expanded Dibdin edition was never finished.

*Preface*

"This Index to Dibdin's Edition of the Typographical Antiquities, or the History of Printing in England, Scotland and Ireland, originally compiled by Joseph Ames, is not a new work, but a reprint of one which exists, so far as is known, only in a single copy, that belonging to the library of Sion College, as to the provenance of which no information can be obtained. The Index has been reprinted at the suggestion of Mr. Gordon Duff, not because it is a good Index, but because the technical defects, which probably account for its never having been put into circulation, are not sufficiently serious to prevent its being a useful makeshift, the publication of which is quite worth the few pounds it has cost to print. Attempts were made to improve it here and there as it passed through the press, but it was found so difficult to alter in one place without altering in another, that it was ultimately decided to let it go forth in its original form.

It has only to be added that the references to Herbert's Edition are distinguished by being enclosed in round brackets."

This amusing bibliographical squib is written by "Carolus Henricus Hartshorne," in whose

It appears from this that only twenty were printed, and probably in a
private manner for presentation.  The spelling and printing are equally
ancient in style, and the whole discourse, ending with the poem, runs upon
black letter and other antique lore. - https://books.google.com/books?id=_A8CAAAAQAAJ[Sabin]

*Preface*

There is not perhaps any man so good a judge of the difficulty of writing a book, as an actual author, He soon discovers how many qualifications are necessary, how much science is rcqnired, and which are the points of most difficult access. He soon finds out his own deficiencies; and, as regards his powers, that some difficulties may he insurmountable. That essay, which sometimes originates in study and amusement, gets insensibly into growth, and is perpetuated. For, having been undertaken in the spirit of an inquirer, it is frequently carried on in the capacity of a student. This student, however, soon Assumes the master, and pronounces his decisions on critical subjects, as authoritatively as if all learning and languages were at his fingers ends.

This not being my case, I have stndionsly avoided much communication with the Germans, or with their most excellent authors, and, in most humble deference, with the dead languages; for, every thing dead, except victuals, I abhor. And, notwithstanding, I possess Noehden's German Grammar or Syntax ; yet, I know not so much of that tongue as of a neat's tongue : or, as a child just born. Nay, in point of guttural expression, I know less. The German tongue is to me most odontolgoid and difficult. And although I am very sensible that mere dint of application may convert an alphabet into a language, yet, all the patent presses in a printing-office, could not squeeze one syllable of the German accent out of my tongue.

No man's industry is mis-spent, if he merely clear the obstruction from any path; and the very attempt to shew what is right, frequently exposes that which is wrong; so that the immediate blunders of one person rectify those of another; and he ever must deserve well of society who attempts improvement.

The bibliographical plan of ihe following sheets has been most ably conducted in the classics, and in other departments, by most-able men. By Harwood, Dibdin, Haller, Gesner, by varus variorum of all countries. The mere arrangement of the dates, somewhat more regularly than heretofore in the medical department, is my only assumption. To the medical student, as far as it goes, it may be useful. It may save his time; and, in a worldly sense, time is money; and money saved to a student, I know from sad experience, to be valuable.

Bibliography is a dry occupation,—a caput mortuum,—it is a borrowed production, which brings very little grist to the mill; and so difficult and tedious is the object,.of laying before our eyes all the real or repotted copies or editions of the works enumerated, that almost every line of our reports hiay be suspected of falsehood. How are we to collect, how to produce, how to examine, the originals? Many books are so scarce, so sequestered in private hands, or in the mansions of the great, that even the keen eyes of lucriferons bookseller* cannot find them. And if they canuot, who the deuce can?

In this sense Bibliomania, in lieu of preserving the use of books, has deprived us of them. Even the little giant Dib—(I dare not draw him at length), can scarcely prevent it. How many vagabond heirs to libraries have sold their books by the pound weight, (though not sterling), to the grocer or pastry-cook. So lamentable to behold! a slushy cook subjecting poor Pliny, in his best condition, again to be burned to ashes, in singeing a pig! and beneath him the divine Homer, (ah cbe gusto !) blazing in the dripping pan, and singeing a goose! Yet he is there, crackling with fire—his wonted fire; which this adept and greasy cook cannot for her life extinguish. Let us then, as we are often desired, just again deplore the fate of the Alexandrian Library in the stews—the literary devastations of the Goths and Vandals—the horrible sacrileges of the French Revolution; of that very nation, where books and bibliography are now in splendour. And also, of those places, where all the fine libraries have been sacked and ransacked, where beautiful editions have been polluted and destroyed, in nocturnal orgies.

From such like causes, what a miserable inference must be drawn. That numberless most inimitable works are not now, by consequence, in existence. That the best editions of old books are most scarce; and that it will require ages of industry, of mere industry, to replace, or to rekindle the torches and wretchedly defaced altars of learning. —See Dibdin, Bibliomania, and the lamentations of many authors.

Meditating on these sad obstructions to the propagation of literature, may we not therefore at least hold praiseworthy any attempt, from any man, to restore, if possible, the spirit and well being even of a monotonous bibliography?

For the endless imperfections of my work, I have a feehle excuse. It is a corselcss exuvinm, irregularly collected, by bits and scraps of leisure and pleasure, from the indispensable occupations of a medical man; who, like some others, is in the actual • enjoyment of all the horrors and irritations of three separate professional departments.

How soon was Clement's alphabet cut off, for want of time, nay of life; who, after employing every moment he had lived, could only accomplish as far as letter G? How short a way did Plonquet proceed on his meditated journey? Did not Dodart, Almeloveen, Caponus, and Tortellius, all leave their histories on this subject unGnished ?— See Kestner.

Other bibliographical bigots will be required, before the alphabet be concluded. And the founder and foundation of any such literary structure, like that of a bridge, must generally be looked for low under-ground—though towering their superstructure.

The reader must not, in common mercy, call upon me to decypher all the enigniatous letters, and initials, in this book. He must make allowance for the critiques I have delivered. They are too free, too flippant, too loose. I am afraid their counter-parts will be too strict, too prudential, too tight. But, being (nescio quo fato) an admirer of the wildness and play of animals in a state of nature, (not as in museo nostro, like skeletons), I doubt that I have exhibited, in my own pages, too much also of the frolics and gambols of a native folly. I pray you, geutlest of all gentle readers, to forgive me; and if there unfortunately be a magazine of fulminating powder in the criticising cells of your os petrosum, don't use a percussion lock or hair trigger; don't let it burst suddenly upon me; for I am of a nervous, quiet, and peaceable, though ridiculous nature ; and far advanced in life. And yon will have no credit in killing so harmless a creature.

But, independent of my various errata, omissions, and mis-interpretations, (all of which, however, I shall palm upon the printer), what excuse can I offer, or what plea can I make, for having,—firstly, plucked other authors of their most brilliant and gaudy feathers: and secondly, for strutting about with them, in alto relievo, as my own? Still farther, what amende can I venture, for that sad lack of gravity, (no, not of decorum,) which here and there, and every where, is so apparent in the most serious pages?

I must request an avant propos—and once for all the reader to observe, that, lest he should get suddenly bogged in the mire of my expressions and absurdities, I shall (as is done in other disagreeable, difficult, and dirty roads,) desire the traveller "to take off arid pot on," as he has seen on a mile post. To take off when the road becomes ridiculous and precipitous; and to put on when it is steady and accessible. So that it will take off all blame from me, should he put on when he is advised to take off; and all blame must lie put on him, if he does put on, when he should take off. And let him now observe, that, by take off, I intend him to take his eyes off the page; and, by put on, I advise him to replace them. To avoid repetition, however, of this notice, I mnst require of him, when he perceives the morality of my pages, or jet of terms, to be rather equivocal; to seance through his fingers only at them—like a good and virtuous young woman, criticising and over-bawling a rake.

Finally—I know there are men who wilfully pervert all meaning. So that, by take off, a man would affect to understand, that he was instantly to take off, full gallop up the hill; and by put on, to stick spurs into bis horse as it the deuce drove him down it. To this, trsty traveller, I have nothing to say ; I only wish to apprize the reader, that if he choose to read my non-sense, with his eyes and fingers open, he must be a greater fool, if possible, than the author who wrote it.

Nor do I affect to assert, that my work is at all calculated for Somnambules in Bibliography.

*Preface*

Nothing has to be added to the above sketch of the history of the Library, save the plain statement that, the Third Edition of the Catalogue being exhausted, it became necessary to print a Fourth Edition. In this are incorporated all the additions made to the Library in the last ten years (the latest added being found in the' Addenda' at the end of the volume). The Classified Index has been carefully revised and enlarged by a competent assistant. ... Great compression has been necessary, in order to confine the Catalogue within the limits of a single volume.

*****
At the end of this work will be found an Index containing, besides the names of the authors mentioned in the Catalogue, who may be known by the paginal figures opposite, every name which I have found any where as belonging to a writer on arithmetic before 1800. Since that period I have not swelled the list from mere catalogues, but have contented myself with what I had either seen, or learnt from some other source. For the existence of such writers, or of their works, of course I do not vouch, except in those cases in which the work is found in the body of the Catalogue. Of those who stand unpaged in the index, all I can say is, that they are taken from many sources, and that there is in each case plenty of reason to make inquiry for their writings, and strong presumption that their works are still to be found.

A word with an asterisk before it is the name of a writer who is referred to by Dr. Peacock. The great apparent preponderance of German names arises partly from the number of works written on the subject in Germany being very considerable, partly from the bibliographical catalogues of that country being more full than those of any other, and partly from the names which seem to be German, really including Danes, Dutch, Belgians, and some Swiss. I am far from thinking that this list contains even the third part of the names of those who have really written on the subject. I have not been particular in searching for any thing after 1750, though I have not refused what came in my way. I might have very much increased the list of recent Germans, from Rogg's Bibliotheca Selecta (Tubingen, 1830). Looking at the various countries which enjoyed the art of printing from 1500 downwards, I have an impression, from all that I have gathered, which would lead me to suppose that the number of works on arithmetic published in Latin, French, German, Dutch, Italian,
Spanish, and English, up to the middle of last century, cannot be less than three thousand, which gives to each language less than an average of one a year. Few of these would seem to fall within the province of the historian. Dr. Peacock refers to about a hundred and fifty. Unfortunately, history must of necessity be written mostly upon those works which, by being in advance of their age, have therefore become well known. It ought to be otherwise, but it cannot be, without better preservation and classification of the minor works which people actually use, and from which the great mass of those who study take their habits and opinions. The Principia of Newton is, if we believe the title-page, a work of the seventeenth century: but the account of the effect which it produced on science belongs to the eighteenth. It was not till many years after the publication of the Principia, that its predecessor in doctrine, the great work of Copernicus, produced its full effect upon general thought and habit. Nor have we any reason to suppose that it could have been otherwise. The great exceptions will always bear, perhaps, as large a ratio to the average power as ever they did: it is as likely as not, that if the intelligence of the sixteenth century had been sufficient to verify and receive the opinion of Copernicus at once, some predecessor of his might have been Copernicus, and he or another of his day might have been Newton.

It is then essential to true history, that the minor and secondary phenomena of the progress of mind should be more carefully examined than they have been. We must distinguish between the progress of possibilities and that of actual occurrences. Our written annals shew us too much what might have been, and too little what was: they give some words to the slow reception of an improvement, and more sentences to the account of the one man who was able to make it before the world at large could appreciate it.

The public is beginning to demand that civil history shall contain something more than an account of how great generals fought, great orators spoke, and great kings rewarded both for serving their turn. The progress of nations might well be described, for the most part, with much less mention of any of the three: but the parallel does not hold of knowledge. Copernicus and Newton would fill a large space, though the history were written down to that of every individual who ever opened a book: but it seems to me that they, and their peers, are made to fill all the space. Nor will it be otherwise until the historian has at his command a readier access to second and third rate works in large numbers; so that he may write upon effects as well as causes.

This list contains upwards of fifteen hundred names, of which a few may be duplicates of others, arising from the wrong spelling of my authorities.* But these must be much more than counterbalanced by the number of names which belong to two or more authors, but which only appear once in my list. Thus there are two Digges's, three Riese's, two named Le Gendre, Walker, Newton, Wallis, &c., and several Taylors, Butlers, &c., though each name is only mentioned once. There are several cases in which I have not ventured to strike out one of two names, though there is every reason to suppose one is a mistake for the other; as Caraldus and Cataldus, Cappaus and Cuppaus, Dohren andDuhren. But I have often been deceived in this way; and have more than once been obliged to re-insert names which I had struck out, supposing them to be only different spellings of names already in the list. There are several whom I have seen in more places than one, who are clearly Germans with names metamorphosed by wrong reading of the black letter, or use of the genitive for a nominative, or both. Thus Petzoldt has become Pekoldts, Seckgerwitz has been made Sectgerwik, Schultze has been made Schulken, and so on. These obvious mistakes of course have not been admitted. Moreover, several persons are, I suppose, down in the list under two names by which they are known. Thus, Fortius may be Ringelbergius (whose real name was Sterk), Blasius may be Pelacanus. But as I cannot undertake to assert that there is no Fortius except Ringelbergius, &c., I have let both names stand in the list. Again, next to Buckley comes Budseus. Many foreign writers, Heilbronner among the rest, have turned Buclxus into Budteus, so that in all probability the second of these names is a mistake for the first. And yet there may be also some Budseus who has written on arithmetic; though, having excluded writers on weights and measures only, I have not put down the author of the work De Asse. 

I have had, in one or two instances, to throw away German authors, for a very obvious reason. The reader will not find the works of Anleitung, or Grundriss, or Rechenbuch in my list, which is more than can be said of every one which has preceded it.

I have not attempted to translate the names of those who
wrote in Latin, at a time when that language was the universal medium of communication. In every such case I consider that the Latin name is that which the author has left to posterity; and that the practice of retaining it is convenient, as marking, to a certain extent, the epoch of his writings, and as heing the appellation by which his contemporaries and successors cite him. It is well to know that Copernicus, Dasypodius, Xylander, Regiomontanus, and Clavius were Zepernik, Rauchfuss, Holtzmann, Muller, and Schlussel. But as the butchers' bills of these eminent men are all lost, and their writings only remain, it is best to designate them by the name which they bear on the latter, rather than the former. In some cases, as in that of Regiomontanus, both names are frequently used: in others, where the Latin consists in a termination only, as Tonstallus for Tonstall, or Paciolus for Pacioli, it matters nothing which is used. It may happen that errors are introduced by returning to the vernacular in a wrong way. I should like to know how it is shewn that Orontius Fineus was Oronce Finee: or in what respect this reading is more finically correct than Horonce Phine, which has great antiquity in its favour? In the case of Vieta, Viete is certainly wrong: he was called by his contemporaries Viet (which I suspect to be derived from the Latin form) and de Viette, never Viete.

It may also be asked, why the unlatinizing process should, for confusion's sake, be practised by the learned only; when it is pretty certain that the world at large will never reconvert Melancthon into Schwartzerd, or Confucius into Kaen-foo-tzee. Neither will they restore to the Popes and other priests of the Roman Catholic Church the names under which they were born and educated.

In many cases it would be impossible to recover these last. For myself, I am well content with the name under which an author was known in literature to his contemporaries, and has been handed down to us, his successors. I know of no canon under which it is imperative to speak of a writer rather as his personal acquaintance than as his reader: and, so far as feeling of congruity is concerned, I think Alexander ab Alexandro looks better at the head of a Latin preface than Saunders Saunderson. Those who really wish to catch the tone of the middle ages, and shew themselves quite at home, should dwell on the Christian name, and make the surname a secondary distinction; should learn to think of Nicolas (who happened to be called Copernicus, or Zepernik, it should matter little which) and Christopher, to whom the calendar was entrusted.

That this list must be very imperfect I am well aware, for I have been able to add many names to it which I never found in any catalogue. But it will not be useless. It may furnish a reason for preserving any work whatsoever which comes in the way of the reader of this book. If the name be in the list, a book should not be destroyed which has been somewhere catalogued and recognised as a portion of the existing materials for the history of science. But if the name be not in the list, it is obvious that there is some curiosity about a writer whose name is not in the most numerous catalogue of arithmetical authors that has ever been collected in any one place. And it is undeniable that every name must be in one or the other predicament.

I now come to the Catalogue which forms the body of this work. The defects, which every one who has examined the lists that are extant, knows to prevail, arise, in great measure, from the titles and descriptions of books being copied by those who had never seen the books themselves. This is not the worst; for a true copy of a true copy is a true copy: many of these accounts have finally become formal representations of informal titles, which, though not originally intended for more than sufficient indication of the book mentioned, have been used as if they had been full and accurate descriptions. There is a large number of works, not much distinguished in the history of science, each of which has, nevertheless, done its part in its day. The minor points of the same history depend much upon these books, which, being neither of typographical curiosity, nor of literary fame, are gradually finding their way either to the waste-paper warehouse, or the public library. These two depositories are almost equally unfavourable to works of no note assuming their place in the annals of the knowledge to the progress of which they have contributed. Take the library of the British Museum, for instance, valuable and useful and accessible as it is: what chance has a work of being known to be there, merely because it is there? If it be wanted, it can be asked for; but to be wanted, it must be known. Nobody can rummage the library, except those officially employed there, who will only now and then have leisure to turn their opportunities to account in any independent literary undertaking. And it would perhaps be difficult to make any regulation, under which persons not belonging to the institution might have access to see what is there. Nor will the publication of the catalogue do much towards supplying the defeet. Titles of books are but vague indicators of their contents; and a catalogue* of half a million of entries, even if its contents could be guessed at by the titles of the books, is not made to be read through.

It would be something towards a complete collection of mathematical bibliography, if those who have occasion to examine old works, and take pleasure in doing it, would add each his quotum, in the shape of description of such works as he has actually seen, without any attempt to appear more learned than his opportunities have made him. This is what I have done in the descriptive catalogue of works on arithmetic, without selection, or other arrangement than order of date. The only reason for a work being in this list, is that it has come in my way: the only reason for one being out of it is, that it has not come in my way, at least at the time of compilation. Whenever any statement is made which is taken from any other writer, it will be put in brackets [ ], except when the statement itself cites an authority: though I have sometimes put the brackets even in the latter case. The only other mode of proceeding would be, to collect lists from authority, naming the sources of information. But, having found so many errors in these sources, when my opportunities have enabled me to bring them to the test, I did not feel inclined to be the tenth transmitter of inaccurate copies. My mistakes shall be of my own making, and it would not be easy to invent one which should want high precedent for its species.

The description of the books in the Catalogue is uniformly as follows. There are given:

1. The place at which the work was printed, in Italics, and generally in English.

2. The date of the title-page, or colophon, or, when both are wanting, of the preface, in words; but not quite at length. Thus instead of fifteen-hundred-and-eighty-eight will be found fifteen-eighty-eight. I am sure that dates will never be given correctly until this plan is universally adopted: for two reasons. First, the chance of error in printing is very much diminished: particularly the risk of a transposition of figures at the press. Secondly, the writer, who is, on the whole, and one date with another, more to be feared than the printer, has time to be accurate. A glance at four numerals and four strokes with the pen, is too rapid a process for certainty: and those who think they can rely upon themselves to stop every time, and look at what they have done, will frequently find reason to wish they had been less confident. But Incidit in Scyllam, &c.: I had very nearly announced an edition of Cocker as being unmistakeably the seventeen-hundred-andtwentieth (see page 56).

3. The author's name. When an initial only is given, it is because the author has left no more, either in title or preface.

4. As much of the title as will certainly identify the book. In spelling, initial capitals, &c., I have generally followed the author closely. When there is any defect in this respect, I suppose it will be in those works which I had not any opportunity of re-examining while the sheets were in proof.. Imitation of type I have not attempted. To have given the full titles would have swelled my book too much: at certain periods the authors of elementary works were much givenXto write out descriptive chapters in their title-pages; scores of them would each have filled two or three pages of even the smaller type used in the Catalogue.

5. The form in which the work is printed; a matter which will require some explanation.

A folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, or smaller work, is now generally known by its size, though not always. In the folio the sheet of paper makes two leaves or four pages, in the quarto four leaves, in the octavo eight, in the duodecimo twelve, and so on. But even a publisher thinks more of size than of the folding of the sheet when he talks about octavo or quarto; and accordingly, when he folds a sheet of paper into six leaves, making what ought to be a sexto book, he calls it a duodecimo printed in half sheets, because such printing is always done with half-sized paper, or with half-sheets, so as to give a duodecimo size. From a very early period it has been universal to distinguish the sheets by different letters called signatures. In the book now before the reader, which is a half-duodecimo (or what I call a duodecimo in threes), the first sheet which follows the prefatory matter, B, has B on the first leaf, and B 2 on the third; which is enough for the folder's purpose. But in former times the signatures were generally carried on through half the sheet, and sometimes through the whole. Again, in modern times, no sheet ever goes into and forms part of another; that is, no leaf of any one sheet ever lies between two leaves of another. But in the sixteenth century, and even later in Italy, it was common enough to print in quire-fashion. Imagine a common copybook, written through straightforward, and the string then cut: and suppose it then separates into four double leaves besides the cover. It would then have sixteen pages, the separate double leaves containing severally pages 1, 2, 15, 16 ; 3, 4, 13, 14 ; 5, 6, 11, 12; 7, 8, 9, 10. If a book were printed in this way, it would certainly be a folio, if the four double leaves of any one quire or gathering were each a separate sheet: and if the sheet were the usual size, it would give the common folio size. But if each gathering had the same letter on all its sheets, if the above for instance were marked Aj on page 1, A2 on page 3, A3 on page 5, and A4 on page 7; the book, when made up, would have all the appearance of a more recent octavo in its signatures. In order to give the size of a book, and at the same time to give the means of identifying the edition by its signatures, I have adopted the plan which gives the following rules:

(a) The words folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, decimo- octavo, refer entirely to size, as completely as in a modern sale-catalogue, the maker of which never looks at the inside of a book to tell its form. All tbe very modern distinctions of imperial, royal, crown, atlas, demy, &c. &c. &c. I have relinquished to paper-makers and publishers, who alone are able to understand them. But in old books, the reader must expect to see the several sizes, each one of them, smaller than in the modern books. When the work is decidedly small of its name, I have noted it by the word 'small.'

(b) When the single word occurs, without any thing more, the signatures are as in the genuine meaning of the word. Thus, as to signatures, folio has two leaves to one letter of signature, quarto four leaves, octavo eight, duodecimo twelve; and of course double the number of pages.

(c) When the modern word occurs with the addition of in twos, or in threes, &c. the addition expresses the number of double leaves which belong to one letter of signature: and which I believe would be found, if the books were taken to pieces, to be in each quire or gathering. Thus, folio in ones, or quarto in twos, or octavo in fours, or duodecimo in sixes, would in each case be unnecessary repetition; for the first word, when alone, is intended to express the gathering in the third. But folio in twos would mean the foho size with two double leaves in one quire, folio in fours with four double leaves. Thus, a book of the octavo size, with the quarto signatures, is octavo in twos: had it been larger, I should have called it quarto. 

By this means there is something as to size, and something as to signatures, in every description. But whether any book which I call octavo in twos, for instance, really was printed on whole sheets, or on half sheets, that is, really was a small quarto, or a divided octavo, is more than I can in any case undertake to say. All I know is, that with these rules, the reader has two indications in every case, to guide him in determining whether the book he has in his hand be the one I describe or not.

This is no unnecessary excess of description. For so frequently, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were there issues of the same impression under different titles, that all I have done will in many cases only give a presumption as to whether a book in hand is or is not the edition I have described. Were I to begin this work again, I would in every instance make a reference to some battered letter, or defect of lineation, or something which would be pretty certain not to recur in any real reprint. Ordinary errata would not be conclusive: for these might be reprinted for want of perceiving the error.

Rules are given for determining the form of printing by the waterlines of the paper, and by the catchwords. It is supposed that the latter are always at the end of the sheet, and also that the waterlines are perpendicular in folio, octavo, and decimo-octavo books, and horizontal in quarto and duodecimo. But in the first place, a great many old books have catchwords at the bottom of every page, many have none at all; and as to the rule of waterlines, I have found exceptions to every case of it Pacioli's Euclid, Venice, fifteen-nine, folio in fours, has horizontal waterlines: the Hypomnemata of Stevinus, an undoubted folio, has thick waterlines both ways. 

6. In the-smaller type are entered such remarks as suggested themselves on the manner or matter of the work, or on any point arising out of it. In some cases these have extended themselves to short dissertations, such as, on the geometrical foot, page 5,—on Sacrobosco's knowledge of the Arabic numerals, page 14,—on the invention of -j- and—, page 19,—on the age of Diophantus, page 47, — on the genuineness of Cocker's Arithmetic, page 56. But for the most part I have contrived to keep within a very moderate compass as to what is said under each work.

The principal point on which I have distinguished one work from another, is as to the use of the old or new method of performing division, which, more than any other single point, decides the character of a work. The letters 0, N, or ON, will tell whether the work uses the old, the new, or both. Not that the verbal distinction is here very correct; for neither method is older than the other; and both appear in Pacioli. A description of the now disused method is given by Dr. Peacock, p. 433.

With regard to the works themselves, I have made no selection, as before noticed. No book that I have seen during the compilation has been held too bad to appear; no book that I have not seen too good to be left out. I have had but one discretion to exercise, namely, to determine the extent to which algebra should be considered as arithmetic. In the earlier day, the distinction was slight: I doubt whether I have not overrated it; but it is not an easy line to draw.

The history of Arithmetic, as the simple art of computation, has found little notice from the historians of mathematics in general. They shew themselves deficient in the knowledge of its progress, and of the connexion of that progress with the rest of their subject. The writers whom I can name as having attempted—some more and some less—to supply this defect, are Wallis, DechiMes, Heilbronner, Scheibel, Kastner, Leslie, Delambre, Peacock, and Libri. I speak of the progress of arithmetical writings as works on science, independently of bibliography properly so called, and biography.

Wallis (p. 44 and Additions) was one of those writers whose works remain the standard of the erudition of their day. His algebra, so called, is rather the history, theory, and practice of both arithmetic and algebra. Its miscellaneous and badly indexed form prevents any from knowing what is in it, except those who make a study of it, which none of our day will do, unless they intend to go rather deeply into the history of the exact sciences. But many and many a page by which the writer intended to gain the credit of research, will be found to be a transcript from Wallis. As a connected history, however, it is nothing; and as a bibliography, less. For example, that Regiomontanus used decimal fractions—a very common story—is the consequence of Wallis's confused method of stating that he introduced the decimal instead of the sexagesimal radius into trigonometry; the confusion arising from his not having a clear knowledge of what had been published of Regiomontanus. And again, we find him, though the editor of an edition of Oughtred, balancing as to which was written first, Oughtred's Clavis, or Harriot's Praxis (which were published in the same year), apparently ignorant that the great method as to which the two authors were chiefly to be compared, did not appear in Oughtred's first edition at all. But for all this, if Wallis be cautiously watched as to books and dates, his works are most valuable magazines of historical suggestion. From them might be collected a much better scientific history of arithmetic than existed in his time, or, indeed, in any time preceding the publication of Dr. Peacock's article on the subject.

Claude Francis Milliet Dechdles was a Jesuit, who published, in four very large folios, a complete course of mathematics, including architecture, carpentery, fireworks, and all that was then held to belong to the exact sciences (see page 53). The first volume opens with about a hundred pages (large folio, double column) de progressu matheseos, consisting entirely of description of books, in order of date. The part relating to arithmetic fills nine of these pages. The whole is done with much care, and is, for the mode of describing books current at the time, very accurate; and the opinions given on the books shew that Dechales had read them. But he is strongly addicted to the very common mistake of judging the books according to what ought to have been said of them, if they had been published in his own time. For example, he finds that there is not sufficient demonstration in Tonstall; which is true, absolutely speaking; but Tonstall-is a very Euclid by the side of his contemporaries.

HeUbronner's Historia, &c. (page 69), though it professes only to give writers up to the beginning of the sixteenth century, makes a particular exception in favour of arithmetic. Up to the year 1740, about 170 authors are recorded, a great many of whom he had not seen. There is also historical dissertation on points of arithmetic. This is a work of great value to the inquirer: he must not rest upon its statements; but he will find more than usual materials tor further research.

Scheibel (Additions) may be considered as partly repetition, partly extension, of Heilbronner. He is one of those bibliographers who collect from various sources the names and dates of more editions than those who know catalogues will readily believe in.

Kastner (Additions) falls under the following censure from Dr. Peacock: "The meagre sketch which Kastner has given of some insulated works on the subject, generally contrives to omit almost every particular which is essentially connected -with the history of the progress of the science." This is 'well merited, inasmuch as the author chose to call his work a history, instead of a bibliography; and as the former, nothing can he more incomplete. I have almost as good a right to call my work a history, as Kastner his. But, as a bibliography, it may be urged in defence, that he gave fuller descriptions of books than his predecessors. Scheibel, Heilbronner, and Dechales sink into title-writers (and bad ones) before Kastner.



The late Professor Leslie (page 89) was one of those men, the strength and asperity of whose opinions would make it fair to deal with them as they dealt with others. In his Philosophy of Arithmetic he has entered incidentally into much of its history. He was, by taste, a searcher of old books; and various dates, &c. occur, which shew that he had more knowledge of books than can be got from catalogues. A few words will sometimes shew this to a person who has compared the books with the accounts of them. But, writing in a popular manner, he does not give references to his authorities, which is a serious diminution of the value of his work. Of Leslie, as an historian on controverted points, one principal thing to be cautious of is, his almost monomaniac antipathy to every thing Hindoo—a most unfortunate turn for an arithmetical investigator. Those who inquire into this subject will see what he is in Colebrooke's hands; those who do not, may compare his description of the Lilivati, "a very poor performance, containing merely a few scanty precepts," with the summary of the contents of that work in the Penny Cyclopedia, article Viga Ganita. Leslie also generalises most fearfully every now and then. He informs us that it was the practice throughout Europe to reduce the rules of arithmetic to memorial verses, and that Buckley's Arithmetica Memorativa appears at one period to have gained possession of the schools and colleges of England. Now the truth is, that the verses attributed to Sacrobosco had never even been printed when Leslie wrote; and Buckley, so far as is known, was printed only once alone, and two or three times as an appendix to a work on logic. Dr. Peacock expresses the truth in saying that, before the invention of printing, the practice of writing memorial verses was common, as appears by manuscript libraries. It is needless to say that, had the practice of using them been common, the presses of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries would have given them forth in great numbers. But I cannot learn that any metrical work was printed in the fifteenth century, except the Compotus of Anianus, and that only once.

Delambre (page 84) wrote on the history of Greek Arithmetic in such a manner as to set that part of the subject fairly going. I doubt if any one since the time of Wallis, at least of their order of note, has exhibited so much of the union of the scholar and the computer. Of the obligations under which the history of astronomy lies to him, it is unnecessary to speak here, or any where : no one man was ever so closely connected -with that science, with its past, its present, and its future, by history, observations, and tables.

Of my opinion of Dr. Peacock's work (page 91)1 need hardly say any more, after the pains which I have taken to give reasons on every point in which I differ from its author, and to correct every little error which I have found. This I judge to be the most undoubted compliment which can be paid to any work. Having looked carefully over it, with a great many of the works mentioned in it in my hands, it would be a strong evidence in its favour, were it needed, that I have found no more to set right than is there noted, in matters of dates and circumstances. It is much to be wished that this treatise should be published separately :* those who can obtain it will find that it gives life and spirit to the catalogue of books -which forms the main part of this work. Up to this moment it is the only work which can be called a history of arithmetic.

M. Libri's history of science in Italy (page 95) is the work of a man who, to the character of a mathematician, adds that of a man who is well versed in literature, and a successful collector of the rarest works in that of his own country. There is much which is interesting in its early history of Italian Arithmetic. Unfortunately, it is not yet finished; and, I am told, is not likely to be speedily resumed.

The history of most of the sciences resembles a river which sinks underground at a certain part of its course, and emerges again at a distant spot, swelled by certain tributaries, which have joined it in the tunnel. Of arithmetic in particular, we note the disappearance in the seventh century of all that was good in the Greek system; and we see the rise, at the invention of printing, of the most trivial part of it, combined with the additions which are now well known to have been received from Eastern sources.

The manuscript literature of the middle ages will prove no very productive source of information, to judge by all that has been made of it hitherto. But then it is to be remembered how seldom, if ever, it has happened, that the investigator of it has united the character of a sufficient mathematician with that of an industrious and well-trained palseographist. Neither the one nor the other can proceed alone: the former has not only to learn how to read, but what to read; for the actual habitat of the manuscripts, and how to get preliminary knowledge of their existence, is a study of itself. The latter is apt to know no difference between what is sound, and what is worthless.

When Euclid, Ptolemy, &c. are first seen to reappear, they come in as Arabic writers. They may be called Greek, but the first translations are from the Arabic; and their effect upon the literature of Europe is, in the first instance, just what it might have been if the authors had been Persians or Saracens. How the communication took place has been considered as a point of small curiosity compared with the importation into Europe of the Arabic numerals.

This subject, both generally, and with reference to the several countries, has been long on the anvil: not the authorship of the letters of Junius has tasked research and ingenuity more than the introduction of the nine digits and the cipher. I suppose nobody would listen to the hypothesis that the former wrote themselves: but I am much inclined to suspect that the latter introduced themselves. The endosmose constantly going on between nations connected by war and commerce would not merely explain so easy a matter, but would render it very difficult to explain how it did not happen, if it had not happened. That the Venetian merchants should not know the system of accounts of those with whom they traded, is incredible: that, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, many priests and some soldiers, returned from their crusades, should not bring back with them the account of so very elementary a difference between themselves and those with whom they had treated, and whom they had in many instances served as slaves taken in war, is unlikely. That Leonard of Pisa, as he is called, was the first who wrote on or in the new system, is pretty generally affirmed by the Italians of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: and there can be no doubt of it. But because we trace the first formal user or expounder to Italy, it by no means follows that the other parts of Europe owe the system to that country in the first instance, however certain it may be that they owe much assistance in the course of the general establishment. It was so common in England in the thirteenth century, that Roger Bacon recommends it (page 14) as a study, of course as a practicable study, for the clergy. Had it not been commonly known, at least as to what it was, he would have done more than give the name of the science, and the names of its rules; he would have added some description. Those who have searched into the matter, merely with a view to Arabic numerals, and without any collateral thoughts about arithmetic in their heads, may have passed over much -valuable evidence. They did not know, perhaps, that the organised rules of computation always went with the Arabic system, and never with the Roman or Boethian: that if ever they came to the connected mention of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, it ought to have been a sign that they were reading on algorism as distinguished from arithmetic. This passage of Roger Bacon has been neglected; though the mere occurrence of the word algorism, in a most interpolable clause of one sentence, occurring in Matthew Paris, has received notice and discussion from Mr. Hallam, from a learned writer in the Archseologia, and probably from others.

The rejection of the work attributed to Sacrobosco may be accounted for from the general ignorance of its having been printed under his name at an early period. Though this does not prove the genuineness of the work, it very much adds to the evidence for it. As early as 1523, the learned world was invited to dissent from the assertion that the treatise in question was written by Sacrobosco, and did not do it. It was often cited afterwards, and never, as far as I have seen, with any doubt. But the only writer of this or the last century that I can find, who describes the printed edition, is the Italian editor of Fabricius, Bibliotheca Latina. 

Come how they might, however, we find ourselves, at the invention of printing, in possession of the knowledge that two distinct systems of arithmetic were current. The streams which had united in one bed had not mingled their waters; and for nearly a century two distinct classes of writings present themselves. Their only common point is the use of the Arabic or Indian numerals and method of notation.



The first, or algoristic system, as we may call it, proceeded by systematic rules to the performance of questions of computation. It embraced mercantile arithmetic, and what was then called algebra: and laborious and prolix efforts were made to combine the two; that is, to represent in such a form as we should now call algebraic, as distinguished from arithmetical, the solutions of questions of commerce, or of what might become such, if the connexion were diligently fostered. I cannot suppose that the multifarious problems of exchange of different kinds which abound in Pacioli and his immediate followers, were actually useful to the merchant: but there is an obvious leaning to the idea that they ought to be so. Geometry was also an application of this arithmetic; and in a manner which strongly marks its eastern character, as will appear to those who compare the work of Pacioli with the Indian books.

The second, or Boetkian system, as I shall call it, because the work of Boethius was its great text-book, did not give any rules of calculation, nor apply itself to any application. The study was the properties of numbers, and particularly of their ratios: There was no art about it; and we have no means of telling whether the philosophers of this school reckoned on their fingers, or used an abacus, or put pen to paper for the performance of some organised method of computation. To judge by the smallness of the numbers used in the instances adduced, we must suppose that the writers left it to their readers to do as they liked best.

For some specimens of the laborious manner by which the Pythagorean Greeks, in the first instance, and afterwards Boethius in Latin, had endeavoured to systematise the expression of numerical ratios, I may refer the reader to the article *' Numbers, old appellations of," in the Supplement to the Penny Cyclopadia. If I were to give any account of the whole system, on a scale commensurate with the magnitude of the works written on it, the reader's patience would not be subquatuordecupla subsuperbipartiens septimas — or, as we should now say, seven per cent—of what he would find wanted for the occasion. Not that the books I am speaking of get quite so far as this. I am hardly prepared to say exactly what number under fifty ought to be named as the terminus of the Boethian store of numbers; but certainly we rarely find them choose their instances from numbers above it. The system broke down under its own phraseology, as did that of the Yancos mentioned by Dr. Peacock, who could not get further than three, because they could not express this idea by any thing more simple than Poettarrarorincoaroac. 

The Italian school of algorists, with Pacioli at their head, found followers in Germany, England, France, and Spain; and in all but England, the Boethian school also. I cannot discover a single English work which pays any detailed attention to the latter class of arithmeticians. Tonstall, and still more Recorde, for the former appears to have been little known, were the preservers; and before the end of the sixteenth century the ordinary style of commercial arithmetic, -which has prevailed among us ever since, was in course of establishment.

This gradual formation of the English school of commercial works will be apparent enough in my list. From the time of Recorde, we always were conspicuous in numerical skill as applied to money. The questions of the English books are harder, involve more figures in the data, and are more skilfully solved. It is possible that I might, if my French, German, and Italian list were more complete, produce exceptions to this rule. But nothing, I think, could arise to alter my conviction that the efforts which were made in this country towards the completion of the logarithmic tables in the seventeenth century, and the instantaneous appreciation of the value of the discovery of logarithms, were the result of that superiority in calculation which I assert to have been formed in the sixteenth. And yet this last-named century produced one "1 man in France, ODe in Germany, and one in Italy, with either of whom no one English calculator could compare in extent of operations: I allude to Vieta, Rheticus, and Cataldi. There was no opportunity to compete with these men; for the subjects on which they worked were not introduced here. It was only towards the end of the sixteenth century that what were then the higher parts of the mathematical sciences began to be disseminated with effect in Britain.

To the commercial school of arithmeticians above noted we owe the destruction of demonstrative arithmetic in this country, or rather the prevention of its growth. It never was much the habit of arithmeticians to prove their rules : and the very word proof, in that science, never came to mean more* than a test of the correctness of a particular operation, by reversing the process, casting out the nines, or the like. As soon as attention was fairly diverted to arithmetic for commercial purposes alone, such rational explanation as had been handed down from the writers of the sixteenth century began to disappear, and was finally extinct in the work of Cocker, or Hawkins, as I think I have shewn reason for supposing it should be called. From this time began the finished school of teachers, whose pupils ask, when a question is given, what rule it is in, and run away, when they grow up, from any numerical statement, with the declaration that any thing may be proved by figures—as it may, to them. Any thing may be unanswerably propounded, by means of figures, to those who cannot think upon number. Towards the end of the last century, we see a succession of works, arising one after the other, all complaining of the state into which arithmetic had fallen, all professing to give rational explanation, and hardly one making a single step in advance of its predecessors.

It may very well be doubted whether the earlier arithmeticians could have given general demonstrations of their processes. It is an unquestionable fact of observation, that the application of elementary principles to their apparently most natural deductions, without drawing upon subsequent, or what ought to be subsequent, combinations, seldom takes place at the commencement of any branch of science. It is the work of advanced thought. But the earlier arithmetic, ns and algebraists had another difficulty to contend with: then fear of their own half-understood conclusions, and the caution with which it obliged them to proceed in extending their half-formed language. It was not merely by oversight, I suspect, that Oughtred so often calculates ab + ac by two multiplications, instead of using a(b + c): but rather from that same general fear of abbreviation, and suspicion that error may lurk in it, which possesses men of business who dare not multiply by 10 by the annexation of a cipher, but proceed with each figure, and carriage, as they would do if the multiplier were 8 or 7. I have seen this often enough; and things nearly as strange times without number. But what shall we say to the following; a most sufficient recommendation of the study of old works to the teacher, as shewing that the difficulties which it is now (I speak to the teacher not the rule-driller) his business to make smooth to the youngest learners, are precisely those which formerly stood in the way of the greatest minds, and sometimes effectually stopped their progress. Perhaps no man of his day had so much power over mathematical language as Wallis. But the following extract of a letter from him to Collins (Macclesfield Collection, vol. ii. p. 579), in 1673, shews that he once had doubts whether he might dare write down the square root of 12 as being twice the square root of 3, however certain he might be that it is so; because no one had so written it. Speaking of the square root of a negative quantity, he says, "Only, though I had from the first a good mind to it, I durst not without a precedent, when I was so young an algebraist as in the history my late letter reports, take upon me to introduce a new way of notation, which I did not know of any to have used before me. And it was not without some diffidence that I ventured on 2 V3, instead of A/ 12, not having then met with any example of a number so prefixed to a surd root; but I found it so expedient, not only for the discovering the root of a binomial, whether quadratic, cubic, or others, but for the adding and subducting of commensurable surds, that I resolved to use it for my own occasions, before I knew whether others would approve of it or no; especially having found in the first edition of Oughtred's Clavis (for I had not then seen the second) one instance or two for it, to justify myself if it should be questioned. But since that time it is grown more common, and I perhaps have somewhat contributed thereunto."

If I were to take such things from old and unknown writers, in which they abound, I should be thought to waste the time of my readers by giving an undue importance to the difficulties of very inferior minds. But those who do not want such a confession as the above from a Wallis, to help to persuade them that the difficulties of progress are of the same character in all ages, will find in old works plentiful and useful supplies of thought for a modern teacher.

Another instance of the halting progress of language is the mode of introduction of the decimal point. Stevinus, the undoubted introducer of the decimal fraction (though others may have seen very clearly the great use of 10, 100, 1000, &c. as divisors), had no such thing, but only a distinct mode of denoting the meaning of each decimal place. Dr. Peacock mentions Napier as being the person to whom the introduction is unquestionably due: a position which I must dispute, upon additional evidence.

The inventor of the single decimal distinction, be it point or line, as in 123-456 or 123(456, is the person who first made this distinction a permanent language: not using it merely as a rest in aprocess, to be useful in pointing out afterwards how another process is to come on, or language is to be applied; but making it his final and permanent indication as well of the way of pointing out where the integers end and the fractions begin, as of the manner in which that distinction modifies operations. Now, first, I submit that Napier did not do this; secondly, that if he did do it, Richard Witt did it before him (page 34).

I have not seen Wright's summary of logarithms, of 1616, to which Dr. Peacock refers for some indications of the decimal point. But I take with confidence his assertion that the first distinct notice of the thing in question, by or by means of Napier, is contained in the Rabdologia (page 35).

In this famous tract there are but two instances to the purpose: a scanty number, be it noticed, for a person who had seized the idea of completing the decimal scale. The first is an instance of division which Dr. Peacock cites. Here the quotient is, as we should now say, 1993-273. Napier uses a comma in his quotient, as a rest, and writes 1993,273, and then presents his answer in the form 19932'7"3"', as Stevinus would have done. Dr. Peacock states this, and notes it as a "partial conformity to the practice of Stevinus." Unfortunately Napier has not given us instances enough to tell us whether he had a practice of his own: and in the only other case, which Dr. Peacock also cites (I have verified both citations), he adheres still more closely to the method of Stevinus. For though, in a question of addition, he has drawn a line down the interval where our decimal points would be, which line would be as distinctive in his total as in his addenda, he places the exponents of Stevinus in this total, which thus has both distinctions, and stands 1994|9'1"6'"0"".

I cannot trace the decimal point in this: but if required to. do so, I can see it more distinctly in Witt (page 33), who published four years before Napier. But I can hardly admit him to have arrived at the notation of the decimal point. For though his tables are most distinctly stated to contain only numerators, the denominator of which is always unity followed by ciphers; and though he has arrived at a complete and permanent command of the decimal separator (which with him is a vertical line) in every operation, as is proved by many scores of instances; and though he never thinks of multiplying or dividing by a power of 10 in any other way than by altering the place of this decimal separator; yet I cannot see any reason to suppose that he gave a meaning to the quantity with its separator inserted. I apprehend that if asked what bis 1231456 was, he would have answered: It gives 123^^, 

not it it 123^j^. This is a wire-drawn distinction: but what mathematician is there who does not know the great difference which so slight a change of idea has often led to? The person who first distinctly saw that the answer —7 always implies that the problem requires 7 things of the kind diametrically opposed to those which were assumed in the reasoning, made a great step in algebra. But some other stepped over his head, who first proposed to let —7 stand for 7 such diametrically opposite things.

Who, then, was the real inventor of the decimal separator, to give both interpretation and operative form? This is a question I will not answer positively: nor attempt to answer till I have pointed out how the case stands with several possible claimants. And first, as to Briggs. He does not indeed arrive at the simple decimal point (which is a strong presumption against such a thing being suggested by Napier; for who would have learnt it from him, if not Briggs?)—but he omits the denominator, and draws a line under the decimals. And it is a further presumption against any such idea of abbreviation being common, that Briggs explains his notation as quite peculiar to himself. In the preface, or Ad Lectorem, of the Arithmetica Logarithmica, London, sixteen-twenty-four, folio in twos, he commences thus:

"Ut obscuritatis crimen, quantum in me situm fuerit effugiam, paucula hsec humanissime Lector, te admonendum censui. 1. Si numerus occurrat cui linea subscribitur, notse illse quse supra lineam sunt descriptae, Nuraeratorem partium constituunt, quarum Denominator semper intelligitur unitas, cum tot cyphris, quot sunt notse superius positse. ut 75 designant -j^j vel f. sic 5 9321 designant 5$?$fo"

Oughtred adopted both the vertical and sub-horizontal separators, thus shutting up the numerator in a semi-rectangular outline. In the mean time, Gunter, after adopting Briggs's notation in the first instance, gradually dropt it, and substituted the decimal point. The history of this symbol in his hands is rather curious, on account of its having been so completely overlooked, though all the circumstances were to be seen in widely circulated works.

Gunter published in 1620 his Canon Logarithmorum, sines and tangents on Briggs's system. To this table there is no explanation. But an explanation was written by him, and, though I cannot make out that it was ever published separately, yet it appears in the collection of his works. I have what is called the second edition of this collection, London, Bixteen-thirty-six, quarto, which, for various reasons, I suspect to be the first, thinking that the announcement of second edition merely refers to the fact of its having been previously published during Gunter's life. After the finis, with new paging and signatures, comes 'The Generall use of the Canon and Table of Logarithmes.' This I suspect to have then made its first appearance: but from the very manner in which the decimal fractions are treated, it is clear that it was written before or with the work on the sector, &c., which first* came out in sixteen-twenty-three; and this, though it makes reference to that work, or at least to its matter. At the beginning of this 'Generall use, &c.' common fractions are used, even when the denominators are decimal. At page 13, Briggs's notation appears, without explanation: and 116 04 is the third proportional to 100 and 108; this continues through page 14. In page 15, a dot is added to Briggs's notation in one instance -. 100/. in 20 years at 8 per cent becomes 466.095/. At the bottom of this page Briggs's notation disappears thus, "It appeareth before, that 100/. due at the yeares end is worth but 92 592 in ready money: If it be due at the end of 2 yeares, the present worth is 85/. 733 : then adding these two together, wee have 178/. 326 for the present worth of 100. pound annuity for 2 yeeres and so forward." After this change, thus made without warning f in the middle of a sentence, Briggs' notation occurs no more in the part which relates to numbers. But in the following chapter, which is trigonometrical (and which may have been written first, for Gunter's own logarithms are only trigonometrical), it reappears, sometimes with and sometimes without the dot. In the previous work on the sector, &c., the simple point is always used: but in explanation the fraction is not thus written, but described as parts. Thus, 32.81 feet in operation is 32 feet 81 parts in the description of the question or answer.

It was long before the simple decimal point was fully recognised in all its uses, in England at least: and on the continent the writers were rather behind ours in this matter. As long as Oughtred was widely used, that is, till the end of the seventeenth century, there must always have been a large school of those who were trained to the notation 1231456. To the first quarter of the eighteenth century, then, -we must refer, not only the complete and final victory of the decimal point, but also that of the now universal method of performing the operation of division and extraction of the square root.

This evident slowness in the admission of such important improvements will not appear singular to those who observe what is now taking place with reference to Horner's method for the solution of equations. It will be the business of some successor of mine, a century or two hence, to distinguish in his list, by some appropriate mark, the works of our period which adopt this method from those which do not: just as I have done with the two methods of division. I hope, if I live to publish a second edition, that I may be able to add to my list the name of the first work, written for students in the University of Cambridge, which shall contain this most fundamental addition to the processes of pure arithmetic: which, though it has found its way into the public examinations, is not yet in the books which prepare students for them.

This has been a long digression, on what is perhaps the most interesting part of the subject, its language. We owe every thing, almost, to the simplicity of certain modes of expression. Nothing is more clear than that the Greek geometers, with all the acuteness and perseverance necessary to carry results of arithmetical application to a high pitch, and all the taste for numbers which would turn their thoughts that way, were stopped by their insufficient system of numeration, and the tediousness of their processes. Tbe history of language, then, is of the highest order of interest, as well as utility: its suggestions are the best lessons for the future which a reflecting mind can have.

In looking over the list of books, it will be observed, that during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there is a great preponderance of English writers. The law I imposed on myself, of entering no books which I could not see, necessarily brought this about. During the last two centuries, the elementary works of the different countries in Europe have not gained great general circulation. They have ceased to be written by the greatest names, for the most part; and they have rarely been cited by the historians of science. Copies which have found their way to this country have probably soon been destroyed. As it is my intention to endeavour to extend this list, whether I publish the extensions or not, and in any case to provide for the preservation of the materials I collect, it will be worth the while of any one who is able, to 

furnish me with information on works which I have not seen. I think it probable that any one who has had the curiosity to rescue three books of arithmetic from a stall, will find that one of them is not in this list. From any such person I shall thankfully receive the full title of the neglected work, with the form in which it is printed. Nor need it by any means be presumed that because a book is wholly unknown, it proves nothing in the history of the science. A book so thoroughly lost as that of Witt, contains a nearer approach to the decimal point than was made by Napier. Horner found a close approximation to his own method, for the case of the cube root, in an obscure compendium of arithmetic. I might also instance Dary's discovery mentioned in page 48; and other things of the same kind. The history of hints given before the time at which they were (perhaps could he) made to bear fruit, would be a very curious one: and the progress of science will never be well understood until some little account can, in each case, be given of the reason why a notion should be so productive at a particular period, which was so barren at a previous one.

On looking at the fourth edition of Gunter's work (sixteensixty-two), I find that some liberties have been taken with the original text: among others, Briggs's notation is restored in several places, though not entirely. It should also be noticed that the point which generally occurs after the first figure of a logarithm is not a fractional separator, but only divides one integer from the rest.

*Preface*



The value of a popular history—by which we mean a narrative especially intended for the instruction or amusement of the unlearned—is not to be estimated by its apparent frivolity. And why is it not? Simply because such a composition is, in many cases, one of the few remaining records which arrested the destruction of numerous facts, trivial perhaps in themselves, but of the utmost importance to the correct understanding of some of our best writers.

A student who is anxious to attain that extensive knowledge of the habits, customs, and phraseology of our ancestors, without which the humour of Shakespeare and many of his contemporaries can only be imperfectly appreciated, will do well to turn his attention to the ancient literature of the cottage, and make himself acquainted with the tales that were familiar "as household words" to the groundlings of the Globe or the Blackfriars. Those who despise this troublesome method of illustration do so without reflection, and invariably without a practical knowledge of its extreme utility. Let us ask, where would a reader turn for explanations of the jocular allusions in a modern farce or extravaganza? Certainly not to the works of Faraday or Mrs. Somerville, but oftener to the ballads of Seven Dials, or even to the songs of the nursery. The observation is true when applied to a more ancient period. If any proof were necessary, it would be found in the fact, that the tale of Jack the Giant Killer is quoted in the second greatest tragedy—King Lear.

We are insisting upon the usefulness of our fugitive popular literature, without the slightest reference to its undeniable value in the history of fiction and the transmission of romance. Merely regarding it as important in the illustration of works, which all the world admit are worthy of illustration, it is contended that the most frivolous books that were read by our ancestors, are at the same time invaluable for the exposition of early English humour.

Under this impression, it is hoped that a short account of some of the most curious popular histories will not be unacceptable to the members of the Percy Society. It may, at all events, draw attention to a subject well worthy of attentive consideration, and attract the notice of those who may be enabled to make important additions to these imperfect memoranda.

Most of the pieces described in the following pages were printed in the last century, chiefly between the years 1720 and 1780; but it is to be observed that, although reprints of much earlier
productions, they have been found to agree minutely with the more ancient copies, wherever an opportunity of comparison has been afforded. In many cases, no copies of the seventeenth century are known to exist; but after our experience of the correctness with which they continued to be reprinted, we may accept the later editions without much hesitation.

*Preface*

ALL the Works included in the BIBLIOTHECA LoNDINENSIs will be found in the “London Catalogue of Books published in Great Britain during the Years 1841–46, arranged in One Alphabet, containing their Sizes, Prices, and Publishers' Names.”

It is hardly necessary, in a preface, to say much of a work of this kind, as it in a great measure speaks for itself. The want of some work that would give a complete list of the books published on particular subjects, without wading through a general catalogue, has been long complained of; and at the repeated solicitations of those who were daily experiencing the inconvenience, the present volume was undertaken.

The labour and research necessary to bring this book through the press can only be known to those who are accustomed to pursuits connected with bibliography. Errors it is wholly impossible to avoid. The classification of thirty-six thousand books, ranging over a period of thirty years, cannot possibly be accomplished without immense care. However, although it is not expected that any catalogue can be complete, it may be permitted here to state that the delay in publishing the BIBLIOTHECA LoNDINENSIS has been solely occasioned by the desire to make it as perfect as possible in repeatedly examining the different divisions of classification.

This book contains a great amount of information; and, however imperfectly the task of compiling it is accomplished, there is no doubt that, to every one connected with literature, it will save much valuable time in searching after all the works written by different authors on the same subjects; whilst to those who buy books, it shows them at one glance the selection they can make, without being subject, from an imperfect memory, to purchase what is subsequently found useless.

The design of this work is new, and was suggested in consequence of many persons referring to the “London Catalogue” being unable to find out the books required. They knew perhaps the title of the book, but not the name
of the author; but this difficulty is now in a great measure removed, and it is presumed that the BIBLIOTHECA LoNDINENsis will be found at least a valuable assistant, if not a rade mecum, to those whose pleasure or business it may be to consult its pages.

In addition to the Classification of Divisions, a copious table of reference to the leading subjects will be found at the end; and facing page 1 is a notice which
explains the plan of the work.

*Preface*

I Must say something I suppose, on offering a book with so strange a title to the reading world; but I could find no better for the little odd antiquities of early literature which much research has enabled me to collect together, and which principally treat of the love of books in monkish days. Perhaps the reader will suspect that my own mind is slightly tinged with the bibliomania of which I write; it may be so, and I trust he will indulgently receive the supposition as a fit apology for any undue warmth and admiration 1 may hereafter express in speaking of monastic learning, and monkish book-worms, and believe me when I once for all affirm, that if I admire the monk, I feel no sympathy with the evils of his system; but award praise only when I deem it due to the erudition of the scholar, or to the piety of the Christian.

To him who feels no interest in the things of the past, who thinks it worthless and unprofitable to inquire into the ways and habits of the old time before us, I fear my book will be a dull volume to his mind, and receive but harsh censure at his hand. Can the reader view a grey old ruined pile, some crumbling fabric over which the ivy grows
triumphantly and fast, as if striving to hide from mortal eyes the decay upon which it gloats; can he look upon so sad a picture and find no interest awaken? If so, I fear he will find but little pleasure in a page of mine.

Can he hold in his hand a manuscript, whose dazzling illuminations mark the labour some poor old monkish student hath bestowed upon it in times long gone by; and feel no delight and rapture as he turns back its crackling leaves? If he finds none then, he will gain none from a page of mine!

Can he enter a Gothic village church, on whose dull walls are preserved tablets, which bear down to posterity the virtues and honours of the humble forefathers of that quiet hamlet—or on whose oaken cornices are engraven the rude images that flashed through the^ brain of some neglected genius of obscure birth, and not feel an interest all absorbing, in pondering on these remains of ancient art? If he does not, I fear he will find but little pleasure in a page of mine. For I am one of those who love to seek knowledge in the black lettered folio, and luxuriate in exploring the membraneous volumes of a monastic age—who love to wander in quiet though among the ruined relics of other days, and delight to glean wisdom and content from the antiquities of a peaceful village sanctuary, and whose very soul is on fire when in the midst of a library, rich with the literature of old.

Reader; I have sketched my portraiture; if the expression be ungainly, let us part company at once.

*Lexicon* (1854, 1158) - Suidas

*****
The Suda or Souda (/ˈsuːdə/; Medieval Greek: Σοῦδα, romanized: Soûda; Latin: Suidae Lexicon)[1] is a large 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Soudas (Σούδας) or Souidas (Σουίδας). It is an encyclopedic lexicon, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The derivation is probably[2] from the Byzantine Greek word souda, meaning "fortress" or "stronghold", with the alternate name, Suidas, stemming from an error made by Eustathius, who mistook the title for the author's name. 

The lexicon copiously draws from scholia to the classics (Homer, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Sophocles, etc.), and for later writers, Polybius, Josephus, the Chronicon Paschale, George Syncellus, George Hamartolus, and so on.[3][4] The Suda quotes or paraphrases these sources at length. Since many of the originals are lost, The Suda serves an invaluable repository of literary history, and this preservation of the "literary history" is more vital than the lexicographical compilation itself, by some estimation. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suda[Wikipedia]

*Preface*

"The writer of a preface has been called “an accomplished liar,” from the exaggerated statement generally made of the labour that has been incurred, and an over-estimate of the value of the work that has been produced. The preface to a book is as the porch of a house, denoting the good entertainment that is provided within the edifice; and an unadorned porch may be the most proper entrance to a simple work, of which the interior furniture may not possess a splendour to justify an elegant approach. A splendid preface and an ill-written book should not come together: yet such junctions or “marriages” are held to be allowable, as they are not “of kin.” A sincere feeling and a truthful modesty must occupy the place of all other expressions, and vindicate the estimation of their value. On these grounds, a few observations are given at risk.

The author of this biography has laboured for more than thirty years in the field of the most enlightened practical agriculture, and in the closet of its illustrations. On closely examining the records of the art, it appeared there was no biography of its writers from the earliest date to the present day, nor any estimate made of the merits of the authors as the progress of circumstances enabled the development. Two lists only are found—one by Weston, which ends in 1772, and contains the names and writings of the authors on agriculture and gardening; the other by the late Mr. Loudon, commencing in 1500, and ending in 1830, with the names and works of the British authors on agriculture, but containing no observations of any kind, nor any biographical sketch. The author was induced to consolidate these two works, and to enlarge them by the access to the national libraries, which revealed several names that had not occurred to these compilers, and afforded the means of continuing the list of . authors to the present time. An opportunity was also thereby given to the author of examining the books themselves, as only some few works are not found in the library, which are mentioned in the biography. This circumstance confers a special value on the compilation, and the extracts from the works will show that the opportunity has not been neglected. No labour has been spared in searching every available record of titles and authors: the King's Library, in the British Museum, has rendered very great assistance, and, with the Bibliotheca Britannica, afforded much information not elsewhere to be found.
The shops and stalls of old books have been examined, and volumes have been there
found and recorded that are not contained in the National Library. The advertising sheets of other books have not been neglected; and these channels have revealed names and titles not elsewhere exhibited. Great obligations are due. to the lists of Weston and Loudon, though several names had escaped their research; yet the greater number of names have found an entry and a reference to their lists as the only authenticity that can be got. The correctness of dates rests with the published works in every case of the books being found; when not seen, the author has followed the lists above-mentioned, and in all doubtful cases the authority is mentioned.

The author entertains a humble hope that his performance may merit a share of public consideration; and if a moderate award be justly established, the writer's ambition will be amply gratified, and his labour fully repaid.

Biographers have been called “literary vassals,” who are bound by fealty to render homage to some superior, and who are under obligation to return the tribute of panegyric for favours that have been received. This character applies chiefly to the writers of a single biography, which is generally undertaken for the purpose of repaying obligations, and of extinguishing the debts of kindness and services. No freedom exists; but every idea must be praise, and every line an echo of merit, whether it was real or accidental. The extent of our subject dispels all relation of vassalage; no obligation is due for favours conferred—no debt is owing for services that may be real or supposed, and no fealty remains unpaid. The author and the writers never met, nor were seen by each other; hence, our opinion is free and unfettered, bound by no ties, and manacled by no obligation. Our biography is rid of the general hindrance, and its removal is strictly as possible preserved. Of the living authors, no opinion is expressed which can raise contention or engender strife a cautious approbation never gives offence."

*Bibliotheca Dramatica. Catalogue of the theatrical and miscellaneous library of the late William E. Burton, the Distinguished Comedian, Comprising an Immense Assemblage of Books Relating to the Stage, And including interesting specimens of the Early English Drama, exceeding in
extent any collection that has ever been submitted to the public competition,
commencing with the earliest dawn of Histrionic Art, and brought down to
the present time. Among these will be found the first four folio
Shakspeares', and seventy other editions; also about 1,500 vols, of
Shakspeariana. An unrivalled collection of Books of Wit and Humor; a
complete series of the History of the Stage, containing Music,
Pageants, Ac. Old English Poetry of the Elizabethan era, including
all of the contemporaries of Shakspeare. Indeed the collection
is at once magnificent and unique, and offers to buyers a
rare opportunity of collecting books not to be obtained
except in the dispersion of Private Collections.* (1860, 463) - William Evans Burton and Joseph Sabin

*Notice*

The Catalogue of Books, now offered to the public, comprises the entire library of the late Mr. Wm. E. Bueton, the eminent Comedian, who devoted many years to its collection, and it is believed to be by far the largest Library of Dramatic Literature ever offered at public auction in this or any other country.

It contains a most surprising mass of rare old English Plays; Works on the Drama, History of the Stage, Theatres, Theatrical Characters and Biography, Pageants, Royal Progresses, and Processions, Mimes, Pantomimes, Masquerades, Mummeries, Mysteries, and Morris Dancers, Fantoccini, Olympian Games, Feats of the Circus, Carnivals, Cavalcades, and every other description of Exhibition which were all objects of Mr. B.'s research; indeed, such was Mr. Burton's enthusiasm that nothing was too trivial that tended in any way to illustrate the profession which he was so eminently qualified to fill.

Old English Poetry, will be found not only voluminous, but abounding in rare and choice copies, including many English translations of the classics of very early dates; while the Dramatic collection is replete with the first editions of most of the Plays of importance. Shakspeariana is especially rich, not only in rare books, but in some presque unique copies of books printed for presentation only.

Amidst such a variety of really choice and rare books it would be almost invidious to make a special reference to any particular work or works; but the fact of there being the First Four Folio Editions of Shakspeare's Works is too important to overlook. Also, all the collected editions from that of Rowe to Halliwell's folio. For a further account of this department, the reader is referred to page 35.

Topographical Works, however rare or expensive, were not forgotten, nor Antiquities of Greece and Rome. Among the former is a fine copy of the first edition of Dugdale's Warwickshire, containing the earliest engraving of the Monument of Shakspeare, by the elaborate, accurate, and most industrious Hollar, which differs materially from all the more recent representations of it, either from the burin of the engraver, or the numerous plaster casts. Dugdale's St. Paul's, Weever's Funeral Monuments, Wren's Parentalia, and Nichols' Royal Progresses will also be found.

Mr. Burton's speciality as an author of Comic Pieces naturally led him to the collection of Books of Wit and Humor; of this fact there will be sufficient evidence on referring to the departments of Faeetite and Jest Books, among which will be found many works of rarity—books of this class being cheaply got up, are especially liable to mutilation.

Polonius's description of the players whom Rosencrantz and Gilderstern "coted on the way" from the Academy at Wittenburg to the Court of Elsinore, as " being the best actors in the world, either for Tragedy, Comedy, History, Pastoral, Pastoral-comical, Historical-pastoral, Tragical-historical, Tragical-comical, Historical-pastoral, Scene indivisible, or Poem unlimited," conveys some idea of the thorough completeness of this dramatic collection. "Seneca was not too heavy, nor Plautus too light."

*Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de livres* (1860-1865) - Jacques-Charles Brunet

*****
In 1810 [Brunet] published the first edition of his 'Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de livres' (3 vol.), and then
enjoyed its success through five editions, the last of which (1860-65) was in six double volumes andis described
('La grande encyclopedie') as a "a prodigy of patience, exactness, erudition, and a monument of bibliography
without rival."  It was supplemented (1878-80) in two volumes containing some 10,000 titles by Pierre
Deschamps and Gustave Brunet.  Brunet largely supersedes earlier bibliogrpahies and is still, excepting certain
library catalogues, our most valuable single source of information for books published from the fifteenth to the
early nineteenth century.  Its 40,000 books are described with fair fulness (except in the sometimes
important matter of collation), with valuable notes on the relation of different editions to
one another and with interesting, though now superannuated, notes as to price,
ownership of copies, etc. - https://books.google.com/books?id=FMEYAAAAIAAJ[Van Hosen and Walter, 1928)

*Notice*

Lowndes' "Bibliographer's Manual" having become an extremely scarce and expensive work, selling at auction for upwards of seven pounds, with a prospect of its increasing in price, the present Publisher thought he should render an acceptable service to the Book-collector, and especially to Booksellers, by reissuing it in a cheap and popular form. With this view he purchased the copyright from the late Mr. Pickering's executors, intending to confine himself to a verbatim reprint, with the exception only of such corrections and additions as had already been made in his own business copy, or might chance to be communicated by friends. But, 
on examining the first few proofs, he unexpectedly found so much to correct and complete, that he 
felt it necessary to change his plans, and bestow considerably more care upon the editing than 
he originally contemplated. Accordingly every sheet has been read over at least four times, 
once by himself, the others by his assistants; notwithstanding which, he has reason to fear 
that many errors and omissions will remain.

It has not been attempted to make the book perfect, but merely to amend and improve it, by 
supplying manifest deficiencies, and completing the accounts of such works as were in 
progress when Lowndes wrote. Some of the additions are marked by brackets; but this plan, 
having, in many instances, been found inconvenient, by far the greater number are without 
any indication; such, for instance, as the articles 'Bible,' 'Blake (Wm.),' and 'Breviaries,' 
which have been entirely rewritten,

New editions of old or standard works are frequently, though not invariably, mentioned; but 
entirely new works, first published since the time of Lowndes, are intentionally excluded, 
being reserved for a Supplementary Volume of Modern Literature; on this principle Macaulay's 
History of England will be omitted, while new editions of Hume, and the elder historians, 
will be duly noticed.

Who have hitherto assisted, or may hereafter assist, either continuously or occasionally, 
must remain to be stated at the conclusion of the work; in the mean time, the communication 
of any corrections or additions will be thankfully received by

*Notice to the Sixth Part*

In several former preliminary notices I have called attention to some of the more important of my 
additions, and think it as well to continue the practice. I have therefore to state that the 
present part is increased full one-fourth on the original work, and every page materially 
enlarged, as reference to the following names, some of which are entirely new, will 
testify :— M'cclloch, J. B. Macgregor, John. Mackintosh, Sir James. Malcolm, Sir John. Mantell, 
Dr. Manuale Ad Usum Sarum. Markham, Gervase. Marryat, Capt. Martin, B. M. Mary Stuart. 
Massachusetts. Mather, Cotton and Increase. Mendham, Jos. Milman, Rev. H. Milton, John. 
Missale. Mitford, Miss. Montgomery, James and Robert. Moore, Thos. More, Hannah. Morgan, 
Lady. Mormon, Book of. Murray, Lindley. Napoleon. Newman, J. H. Newton, Sir Isaac. Nichols, 
John. Nicholson, Peter. Nicolas, Sir Harris. Norton, Hon. Mrs. Nowell, Alexander. 
Oliver, Rev. George. Ordnance Surveys. Ormerod, George. Ossian. Ottley, W. G. Ovid. Owen, Rich.

It was not my original intention, as stated in a Notice to the Second Part, to introduce any names
which had not already been given by Lowndes, taking it for granted that he would be complete to the
date of publication, 1831, and that I should merely have to continue his lists; and to this rule I
at first adhered, but afterwards found so many important omissions in the department of contemporary
Literature, that it became necessary to abandon the prescribed limit. Accordingly, the present part
will be found to contain many such additional names as Capt. Marryat, Dean Milman, John Henry Newman,
Sir Harris Nicolas, and Professor Owen; all of whom had acquired literary reputation before the
period in question, and were better entitled to mention than some who have been included.

The next part is in progress, and will, I hope, be published in the ensuing spring.

*****
*Notice to the Seventh Part*

I had hoped to publish the present Part several months ago, as promised, but found this impossible.
It has unexpectedly required more personal labour than any of its predecessors, as may be surmised 
from the fact that it is enlarged to full double the matter contained in the parallel portion of 
the original work. There are certainly not twenty consecutive lines without correction, and a 
larger proportion of additional articles are inserted than heretofore; in verification of 
which I invite attention to the following articles: PAINE, Thomas; PALEY, William; PALGRAVE, Sir Francis;
PANIZZI, Antonio; PARLIAMENT; PARR, Dr. Samuel; PARSONS, Robert; PASCAL, Blaise; PATRICK, Symon;
PEARSON, John; PENNANT, Thomas; PENTATEUCH; PERCIVALL, William; PETRARCH; PETTY, Sir William;
PHILLIPPS, Sir Thomas; PINDAR; PLATO; PLAYS; PLUTARCH; POETS; POLEWHELE, Richard; POPE; PRAYER; PRIESTLEY, Joseph; PRIMER; PROCESSIONALE; PROVINCIAL SLANG; PRYNNE; PSALMS; PUGIN; PURCHAS; PUSEY, Edw.; QUAKERS; 
QUARLES; QUINCEY, DE; RAFFAELLO; RALEIGH, Sir Walter; RAPIN; RAY, John; RECORDS, Public.

The supplemental pages devoted to LORD MACAULAY are, as will be seen, an afterthought, arising
from accidental circumstances. Although literary anecdota are not immediately within the scope of 
the present undertaking, I could not resist the pleasure of preserving an interesting scrap of a 
writer so universally esteemed. The article on DE QUINCEY is thrust into this Part, out of what
is strictly its proper place, rather than omit it altogether. This has arisen in consequence 
of my original plan having been to limit all additions to the pegs previously provided by Lowndes; 
and he happened to omit De Quincey, although the " Confessions of an Opium-Eater " had been 
printed and become popular within his time. I soon found it desirable to abandon this exclusive 
plan, and in the later letters have introduced most writers of mark who commenced their 
literary career before 1834.

And here I will take leave to advert to an individual piece of advice given in a contrary direction.
An influential paper some time since admitted a paragraph into its pages, in which it is
suggested that my edition of Lowndes would be more acceptable to the "students of our early 
literature," if it were restricted to books published before the time of Queen Anne—the avowed
object for such a curtailment being to make it "a handy manual." On this principle it would be
necessary to omit Defoe, Addison, Swift, Pope, and a hundred other of our best English writers, 
as well as almost all the principal Voyages and Travels, English History, Topography, books of 
Science and the Fine Arts. Besides which, to follow out the scheme literally, I should have to 
exclude all modern editions of an early writer, so that there would be no mention of any edition 
of Shakspeare or Milton subsequent to 1702, when English criticism was in its infancy. Such a 
book would not entail a twentieth part of the trouble and expense which I now undergo, but I 
should be ashamed of the present condition of bibliography if I thought my subscribers would 
be satisfied with such a retrogression.

My endeavour has been to make a manual practically useful to book-buyers of every class, especially
the literary student; and fifty years of active experience ought to enable me to form a correct 
judgment as to the right course. The price too of the complete work is so extremely moderate, 
counting on a large sale, that a selection of merely one fourth of the matter, which could only 
command a very small one, would probably cost quite as much. Take as an instance: a well-known 
literary antiquarian has recently printed a small number of copies of a dry list of the twenty 
quarto plays of Shakespeare, which is sold for about half a guinea. Now the whole of the matter 
contained in this halfguinea's worth (which by the by is substantially contained in the old 
Lowndes) will be incorporated, with considerable additions, in my next volume, and, reckoning 
the number of pages it is there likely to occupy, will cost less than two-pence.

The next Part will be published as speedily as due care permits, and will include very 
elaborate articles on Shakspeare and Swift. But this will not complete the work; for, unless 
a mere reprint of the old matter were adopted, it would be impossible t to squeeze the remainder 
into so small a compass. My subscribers must therefore be prepared for a Ninth Part,—to nobody's 
regret more than my own.

*****
*Notice to the Eighth Part*

The present Part has been lingering at press for upwards of twelve months, notwithstanding that it hag received more anxious and persistent attention than any of its predecessors, which were completed in half the time. The cause has been, that the portion of Lowndes on which this is based, is unusually deficient, and has required a disproportionately large number of additions, besides a full average of corrections. Indeed, the original matter has been more than doubled, as the slightest examination will show. The labour of this extensive revision has been very exacting, and no sale of the book is likely to repay even the cost of my amanuenses, much less the value of my own time; whereas, a simple reprint of the old book, however unsatisfactory in a literary point of view, would have been a remunerative speculation.

They who have taken the trouble to read my prefatory notices to the earlier Parts, will see how much more I am performing than I originally undertook; yet ever and anon I am called upon to do still more. Some requisitionists, overlooking that I limited myself at the outset to the period comprehended by Lowndes, with the intention of including later writers in a Supplement, ask me why I hare omitted Dickens, Grote, Bulwer-Ly tton, and many other distinguished writers of the present day P Others Beem to expect that I should register every book, pamphlet, and broadside, in English literature, as well as foreign translations of them, and also indicate what they have sold for by auction, and where they are to be found in public libraries! A pretty task truly, which, if it could be accomplished, would occupy about fifty folio volumes, and as many amanuenses! Such suggestions do not come from practical bibliographers, but from shallow pretenders, who seek to acquire the reputation of critics by finding fault with what they would be quite incompetent to perform.

Every article of importance in the present Part has received considerable additions, of 'which the following may be taken as examples:—Eitson, Eochesteb, Eoyal Society, Schillee, Scotland, Scott (Sir "Walter), Shaw (Henry), Shelley, Sheridan, Shielby, Shoet-hand, Sibdald, Sidney (Sir Philip).

Shakespeare, as a warrantable exception to all ordinary rules, has been elaborated up to an extreme point, and is a main feature in my bibliographical labours, past, present, or to come. I have not only endeavoured to record every printed edition of his works, whether published collectively or separately, but also all the volumes written respecting him, (commonly called 'Shakespeariana,') and all foreign translations. Besides this, I nave given new and careful Collations of the first four folios, and of the early editions of the Separate Plays and Poems, with particulars of their whereabouts as far as the most diligent research has enabled me to trace them. This labour alone has occupied all my literary leisure for many months, and nothing but the pleasure of working on so congenial a subject could have stimulated me through the task.

I close this address with the hope that I shall complete the Lowndes Alphabet before the expiration of the present year. - Henry G. Bohn

*Notice to the Ninth Part*

There is little to say on the present occasion which has not. in some shape, been said before, excepting that I am within sight of the goal I have long been anxious to reach, and am heartily glad of it.

Where almost every article has been revised or rewritten, it is difficult to point out particular examples, but, in conformity with my previous notices, I venture, almost at hazard, to call attention to the following:

SKELTON, John; SMITH, Adam, Horace, Capt. John, and Sydney; SMOLLETT; SNELLING; SONGS; SOPHOCLES;
SOUTHEY; SOWERBY; SPENSER; STATE PAPERS; STATUTES;
STEELE; STEWART (the Walking); STERNE; STRUTT; STRYPE; STUKELY; SURREY, Earl of; SWAINSON; SWEDENBORG; 
SWEET; SWIFT; TACITUS; TASSO; TAYLOR, Isaac, Jeremy, and Thomas the Water-Poet; TERENCE;
TESTAMENT, the New; THOMSON, James; THORPE, Benjamin; THUCYDIDES; TODD, H. J.; TOOKE, J. Horne;
TUCKER, Dean; TRUSSLER; TURNER, J. M. W.; TYTLER; USSHER, Abp.

The largest part of my attention has been devoted to unravelling the intricacies of the early editions of the English New Testament. In this I have been especially assisted by Mr. Henry Stevens of London, Mr. Francis Fry of Bristol, and
Mr. George Offor of Hackney; gentlemen who are very conversant with the bibliography of the Scriptures, and have shewn great readiness in communicating the results of their investigations.

I am scarcely less indebted to the acting Librarians of the British Museum and other public Libraries, who have throughout entertained my inquiries with great good will.

*Preface*

IN preparing this Catalogue, the plan of the Compiler has been to give the full titles of books, except in cases where there are several editions of the same work without a change of title. In such cases, the title of the first edition only is given, while the titles of subsequent editions are abridged. Of the earliest and most important works, he has given the colophons. These are necessary, to identify particular editions; besides, they often indicate where the book is printed, the printer’s name, and the date, which are sometimes wanting on the title-page.

As many of the most important works on America, printed before the year 1600, are now exceedingly rare, and seldom seen except in large collections, and, moreover, as they are the groundwork of all modern American histories, the Compiler has thought it best to give in notes a brief account of the authors of such works, and a critical estimate of their writings. As a guide to the collector and the historical student, he has also mentioned the several editions and translations of the books in question.

*Preface*

THE plan adopted in the first part of this Catalogue has been adhered to in the present-part, except that the notes are less numerous and more brief. In ‘the seventeenth century the proportion of books relating to America, printed in the English language, was much greater than in the sixteenth, and hence better known. Another reason why notes are unnecessary in so many cases, is, that the titles, often of great length, convey all the information that a bibliographer would put in his notes.

The Compiler has deemed it advisable to include in this Catalogue many of the writings of the early theologians of New England. Without these, an American Bibliography would be incomplete. Some of these books have reference to the early colonization of the country; others are controversial, and relate to civil and religious questions which have a direct bearing upon the government and laws of the colonies to which they appertain; while others, of a more theological character, have, nevertheless, a bearing on the intellectual and religious development of the people. With this view of the literary productions of the early writers of America, many of the writings of Cotton and Increase Mather. John Cotton, Thomas Shepard, John Norton, John Eliot, William Pynchon, Edward Winslow, Thomas Cobbett, William Penn, Thomas Hooker, John Burnyeatt, Roger \Villiams, John Clark, Samuel Gorton, and others, are noticed.

*Preface*

IN publishing the third part of this Catalogue, the compiler has adhered to the plan adopted in the two previous portions, namely, of following a chronological arrangement. With some collectors and bibliographers this plan is disapproved, as the writings of an author are thereby scattered throughout the catalogue ; but all objections on this account are removed by printing an alphabetical index, which will be found at the end of the work, where every work mentioned in the catalogue is repeated in a single line, with its size, printer's name, and date. When, therefore, a particular work is sought for, without knowing the date of its publication, reference should be had to the Index. Here the works of every author, as well as the several editions of them, stand under his name. One can in this way see at a glance the productions of any author. To render the Catalogue more useful to the student of American history, subjects have been introduced into the Index. Thus, under the heads of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Carolina, Georgia, Florida, California, Canada, Greenland, Jamaica, Paraguay, etc., will be found any book mentioned in the Catalogue, when the work relates particularly to the subject referred to. Such subjects as New England, Mexico, and the West Indies, are not mentioned in the Index, as they cover a very broad field, and are more or less referred to in all general works on America.

The books in the library are arranged according to subjects, so that the particular book sought for may readily be found. With regard to North America; first come General Histories; these are followed by works relating to Greenland and the Polar Regions, the British Provinces, New England, the separate states; books relating to the Indians, Dictionaries and Grammars in the Indian languages, poems relating to America, etc., etc. Then follow books relating to Spanish and Portuguese America, the West Indies, the various countries of South America, voyages to the South Sea and around the world, etc, etc. There is a collection of about fifteen hundred pamphlets of the eighteenth century which do not refer to particular countries or states, but to a great variety of subjects, including the Revolutionary War. Each pamphlet is separately bound, fully lettered along its back, and chronologically arranged.

*****
*Preface*

During my whole life, now rapidly approaching fourscore, I have been a diligent reader, and, as far as my means would allow, a greedy purchaser of all works connected with early English literature. It is nearly sixty years since I became possessor of my first really valuable old book of this kind, — Wilson's "Art of Logic," printed by Richard Grafton in 1551, — from which I ascertained the not unimportant facts that "Ralph Roister Doister" was an older play than "Gammer Gurton's Needle," and that it had been written by Nicholas Udall, Master of Eton School. I thus learned who was the author of the earliest comedy, properly so called, in our language. This was my first literary discovery, made several years anterior, although I had not occasion to render it public, until I printed my Notes upon " Dodsley's Old Plays" soon after 1820. My latest discovery, which occurred only a few months ago, is that "Tottel's Miscellany," 1557, the oldest and most interesting in our language, containing as it does the poems of the Earl of Surrey, Sir Thomas Wyat, and their contemporaries, has always, during the last three centuries, been reprinted, by Dr. Sewell, Bishop Percy, Dr. Nott, and their followers, from the second instead of the first edition. The differences between the two are not merely extremely curious, but very interesting and important.

Between the one discovery and the other there was an interval of perhaps fifty years; and whatever may appear to be new in the ensuing volumes has been the result of literary investigation during considerably more than that period. My early employments were irksome and wearisome; but, stimulated in some degree by my first success, and by my love for the best poetry the world has produced, I lightened my labors by the collection and perusal of old English books, and by making extracts from and criticisms upon them, whether in prose or verse; so that in time they formed a large body of manuscripts, consisting of separate articles alphabetically arranged.

The work in the hands of the reader has been mainly derived from this source, and not a few of the notices are of forty, or even fifty, years standing. Although I kept constantly adding to, altering and correcting them, both as to facts and opinions, some of them are, in the most material points, just as they came from my pen, soon after the perusal of the books to which they relate. It will be found that a few are reviews of productions altogether unknown to bibliographers, while others apply to publications of which only a single copy remains to us, or to separate tracts of the utmost rarity.

It is true that notices of a very few more common, but still scarce, books will be found interspersed, a circumstance arising from the fact that I have incorporated all the productions formerly embraced in what is generally known as the "Bridgewater Catalogue," which about thirty years ago I prepared for the first Earl of Ellesmere, and which was privately printed at the expense of that gifted, enlightened, and liberal nobleman. Through my hands in 1837 he dispersed, as presents, in different quarters of the globe, the fifty copies of which the whole impression consisted; but, some years after the completion of the undertaking, his Lordship expressed his regret, that the limitation in point of number much restricted the utility of that Catalogue. He therefore authorized me at any time to reprint it, if I thought it would answer as a pecuniary speculation. During Lord Ellesmere's life I never availed myself of this permission; but a proposal of the kind was made to me not long after his demise. I did not then listen to it, because I was still anxious to introduce corrections upon many of the pages; and because, even then, I contemplated a work upon a broader basis, and of a wider range, not limited to the contents of any single library, whether public or private.

It may be stated, nevertheless, that in the course of my four volumes, I have reprinted the whole of the "Bridgewater Catalogue." I refused to mutilate it by the omission of any article, however comparatively insignificant; but I have, at the same time, carefully inserted whatever information I subsequently procured, and the consequence is that there is no one piece of criticism, derived from the "Bridgewater Catalogue," that has not received improvements more or less important . Had I not been desirous of giving that work
in its entirety, I might have discarded accounts of a few books of more ordinary occurrence, but which the autographs of the writers, in dedications or otherwise, had rendered of peculiar interest and value in the Ellesmere Library.

Before that memorable assemblage of books came into the possession of Lord Francis Egerton (afterwards the first Earl of Ellesmere) some highly important works had been turned out of it, in many instances under the mistaken impression that they were duplicates. These supposed duplicates, generally marked by John Earl of Bridgewater (who died in 1649) in a somewhat peculiar manner, were to be found on the shelves of several booksellers, or in private hands, and two or three occurred in sale-lists not long after the preparation of the "Bridgewater Catalogue." One of these may be specified as the finest copy of the sonnets of Shakspeare (4to. 1609) that has ever been seen, and I had the satisfaction of repurchasing it for Lord Ellesmere. Having also a noble collection of old plays, (though much impaired when imaginary duplicates were incautiously extruded,) his Lordship was at all times anxious to restore them to their ancient places at any price, and he commissioned me to secure such relics for him. He besides applied a considerable sum every year to the formation of a separate library, especially devoted to the illustration of Shakspeare and our early stage. This most agreeable duty Lord Ellesmere assigned to me; and had not the commission on the British Museum intervened, (on which I felt, most reluctantly, bound to take an independent course, in favor of a compendious catalogue which would enable readers instantly to find the book wanted without wading through a labyrinth of tediously extended titles,) this design might have advanced considerably farther towards completion. The difficulty was to procure the books, so rare and costly had the best of them become, but Lord Ellesmere did not hesitate to purchase any work I recommended. There never, perhaps, existed a more confiding or bountiful patron; and, after an intercourse of more than thirty years, I may venture to say, with affectionate humility, that the only fault of his character was having too high an estimate of those who were interested in misguiding him, and too little reliance upon his own unswayed convictions.

It is now above sixty years since I first obtained a ticket for the reading-room of the British Museum, and my own notions as to the easy possibility of procuring a short and useful catalogue of the books, have never undergone the slightest change. This is probably the last preface I shall ever be able to compose, and I therefore add, that if the Lord Ellesmere of 1847 and 1848 had only been as firm as, in my opinion, he was originally right, we might possibly (I only say possibly) long ago have obtained the easiest mode of reference to every printed volume in the library. The want of it has often kept me, and others, away from the reading-room, because, in the confused multitude of volumes over which the various catalogues are distributed, we never could be sure whether the books we were in search of were, or were not, upon the shelves of the Institution. It is, besides, the misfortune of the British Museum that it is peculiarly deficient in works of the class to which I was anxious expecially to refer. I willingly admit that this is not the fault of the present principal librarian. In our time, the books are not to be procured, except at enormous prices, particularly if it be known that the British Museum is in the market. My acquaintance with the head of that establishment is necessarily very slight. I am well aware, however, of his energy, ability and acquirements; but I must say, that the long-felt want of a concise and intelligible mean of reference to the books in the British Museum (which mean he has always resisted) much counterbalanced the other advantages derived from his position, when he had the control of the department of printed books. Such are my confirmed sentiments, after a lifelong experience in the library, and when, in my seventy-seventh year, I am so near the end of my laborious course, that the existing state of the catalogues can make little difference to me.



I have reason to know that, nearly twenty years since, I injured my own prospects by the part I took upon this subject; because, if I were correctly informed, the commissioners had at one time a design to separate the printed book department into two portions— English and foreign. If this reasonable plan had been carried out, and I had accommodated myself to the views of those who were for a manuscript catalogue in five or six hundred huge folio volumes, I might, with the assistance of the Earl of Ellesmere, as head of the commission, and of the Duke of Devonshire, as one of the trustees, have had a chance of filling the appointment which would thus have been created. I am now, of course, too old for any such
duties, but the trustees, after the close of the inquiry, did appoint a new and a most valuable officer in another overgrown department. All I wish now to do is to record, before I die, my ancient conviction in favor of the scheme I advocated in my two days' evidence before the commissioners, by whom, I fear, I was considered a very obstructive secretary.

For the reasons stated, I have obtained few of my materials from the British Museum, while from the Bodleian library, where the books are instantly accessible and the catalogue complete, I have from time to time derived important assistance. The head of that establishment and the other learned curators were never weary of giving me their readiest aid. My chief reliance, however, has been upon my own industry and vigilance, willingly encouraged, even from my outset, by the liberality of private individuals, who had fine collections of rare books, from the days of Sir Francis Freeling and Mr. Perry down to the later acquisitions of Mr. Heber and Mr. Miller. To collectors of a later period I have seldom been indebted; but I may mention the name of one bookseller who was always glad to contribute to my purpose — the late Thomas Rodd, a man as celebrated for his knowledge of books as for his fairness in dealing with them. Many and many a literary rarity has he purchased for my use and advantage, sometimes at my instance; and as the price of such commodities has been gradually rising during the whole of the present century, neither he nor I ever had to regret the dearness of our bargains. He was of a good family, but accidentally reduced, and my father and his father were at the same public school; they afterwards met in Spain, and it was in the year 1804, or 1805, that my father first took me to the old book-shop then kept by his worthy, though less fortunate schoolfellow. This was, in fact, my introduction to the early literature of our country; and it was not many years afterwards that I purchased my first old English book of any real value, Wilson's "Logic." Long subsequently I bought hundreds of other books from and through Rodd; but, as I never was rich enough to collect, and keep, what may be called a library, he sold them again, and very seldom at a loss.

Readers may imagine that I have obtained much in formation from such works as Centura Literaria, " The British Bibliographer," or Restituta, to say nothing of smaller productions of a similar character. This is a mistake. I have never referred to them without acknowledgment; but it will be found in the fourteen hundred pages that follow this preface that, excepting for the sake of illustration or for the correction of some important error, I have never criticised, or I may almost say, quoted a single volume noticed by others. It was generally enough to induce me to lay an old book aside to find that it had already passed through the hands of Brydges, Park, or Haslewood. To the taste and learning of the first I bear willing testimony. The second possessed knowledge, but without much discrimination; and the third was a man remarkable for his diligence, but remarkable also for the narrowness of his views, for his total want of judgment, and for the paucity of his information.

I can assert, without the chance of contradiction, that there is no one book, the merits or peculiarities of
which are discussed in these volumes, that has not passed through my own hands and been carefully read by my own eyes. There is no extract, no line, that has not been copied by my own pen; and although I cannot for an instant suppose that I have altogether avoided mistakes, I hope that I have made as few as possible. In a case of this sort, where hundreds of names occur, and thousands of dates are given, errors must inevitably have crept in; but I am aware of none, whether relating to books or their authors, that I have not set right in the "Additions, Notes and Corrections," placed at the beginning of my book, as it were, to solicit the indulgence of the reader in the outset.1 Even if this work be found to deserve reprinting, I can hardly hope to live to superintend a revised edition of it.

It may be necessary to add, that I have purposely avoided old English dramas and plays, because they form so distinct a subject that they ought to be separately treated. I have by me many details regarding the plots, characters, poetry and appliances of performances of this description, from the remotest dates, some of them relating to productions hitherto unrecorded; and if time, opportunity and eyesight should unexpectedly and graciously be allowed me, it will much add to my happiness to be able hereafter to put them into shape for publication. Bum spiro spero.

*****
The first issue consisted of three hundred copies only.  The publishers' certificate
to that effect is usually inserted in the work. "The illustrations of this work,
which, unlike facsimiles produced by hand, must necessarily be absolute reproductions
of their originals, exceed one hundred in number, and frequently consist of representations
of entire pages from many of the most interesting books produced by the early printers.
Among them may be mentioned an entire folio page from the first printed
Bible, the magnificent work of Gutenberg, richly adorned with ornamental obrderings by
a contemporary German illuminator.  An entire page from the celebrated Psalter
of Schaeffer, in which the largae capitals are printed in colours, in rivalry with the
illuminators of the time.  Pages from the first books printed in Italy, France, Spain,
Flanders, and Holland, accompany the accounts of the introduction of the printing press
to those countries; and several such entire pages in facsimile illustrate the
description of the works of William Caxton, the founder of the printing press in
England.  In addition to these and many illustrations of other kinds, will be found
a very interesting and abundant series of examples from the most richly decorated
of the French 'Horae', and from the profusely illustrated German books produced the
the first half of the sixteenth century."  The copies dated 1868 are somewhat
inferior as regards the plates. - https://books.google.com/books?id=_A8CAAAAQAAJ[Sabin]

*Polybiblion: Revue bibliographique universelle* (1868-?) - Henri Stein

*****
Stein attempts a synthesis of all the bibliographies published up to the end of 1896.  It is,
however, as he says, a selection, and dispenses absolutely with mention of superseded
bibliographies.  The writers on bibliography who have criticised as unfeasible
and undesirable the compilation of universal bibliography, have criticised
Stein's attempt as too ambitious, and it must be admitted that the work does
show the effects of covering a tremendous field, and probably somewhat in haste.
His notes are often altogether too brief, many omissions have been noted, such as
a list of other bibliographies of bibliographies (he mentions Petzholdt and Vallee
only the the preface). His list of universal bibliographies has only five
titles (including bibliographies of best books).  His list of the numerous
special bibliographies is entirely inadequate.  His list of encyclopaedias fails to
mention the great French "Larousse," as well as any Italian and Spanish encyclopaedias.
Errors in transcription of titles are unfortunately numerous.  Cross-references and author
index (prime essentials in a clasified list) are wanting.  The number of volumes of periodicals is not given.  Nevertheless we have found Stein's work indispensable.  The appendices deserve special
mention: a "Geographie bibliographique" (list of places where books were printed
before the nineteenth century); a very valuable list of indexes publishd by individual
periodicals; and a list of publications of the principal libraries of the world. - https://books.google.com/books?id=FMEYAAAAIAAJ[Van Hoesen and Walter, 1928].

*****
*Preface*

This little work is the first of the kind, so far as we know, that has ever been attempted in the English language; and such being the case, we crave the indulgence of the public for our numerous shortcomings. In publishing it we felt the necessity of commencing somewhere. We might, without doubt, have spent twenty years in a similar compilation; but even then it would not have been perfect:—in fact, it is not in the nature of a book like this to be made perfect. It can, however, approach completeness by the aid of numerous contributors. If, for example, each one who found a name wanting, were to send an authentic note of it to us, an immense amount of information would soon accumulate, which we would undertake to embody in a supplement devoted to additions and corrections, if the present attempt should receive sufficient support. By this means we trust we shall help to fill up the gap which is at present a reproach to our nation.

The utility of a work of this kind, even though very
imperfect, is at once so apparent that it is a matter of considerable surprise such a blank should have been left in our literature.

Another work of a similar nature, but larger and different in scope to ours, which Mr. Halkett, of the Advocates' Library, has been preparing for some fifteen years past will be a considerable addition to British Anonyms and Pseudonyms. On the Continent numerous works treating of the subject of assumed names of authors have been published, and in fact the idea of nearly every English work that treats of books and their authors appears to have been taken from our foreign brothers in literature. We are indebted to Qudrard for the idea and plan of this work. In the advertisement to the second edition of his "Supercheries Littdraires Devoiktes," he observes that Germany first produced a work on anonymous and pseudonymous authors; then Italy; then France, for the first time, in 1690, by Adrien Baillet. Then Sweden, and lately Belgium, and even Bussia. Now we wish to direct attention to the remarkable fact that Querard was unable to name a single English author as having treated of the subject, though in France it was treated of two centuries ago.

Our original intention was that this should be a handbook for popular use; consequently, as a rule, we pretend to no scientific detail. Those who desire such must seek it elsewhere; and yet we hope the erudite bibliograph, though he may learn nothing from these pages, will find much wherewith to refresh his memory. One object we have endeavoured never to lose sight of, — usefulness.

With us the word Pseudonym has a very extended signification, as these pages will show. Any word, or name, or phrase, on a title-page is sufficient to make a work pseudonymous. It is not considered anonymous unless its title-page is hopelessly deficient of all personal identification of authorship.

We do not, for example, consider a work "By The Author of," &c., anonymous, as do Lowndes and his editor. This example is also a good illustration of the labour we have had to go through, and it will show that our handbook is by no means a compilation from existing manuals, for the simple reason that these nearly always leave out the very information it is our object to include. In Lowndes, by Bohn, under "Sheeee (Major Moyle)," we have seven out of a list of nine works specially marked "(anon)." Now, according to us, three of these works, at least, are strictly pseudonymous, and consequently included in our list. We could cite other instances from any bibliotheca.

We have made an attempt to distinguish the various kinds of pseudonyms by using certain technical terms in italic letters after each pseudonym. A list of these terms will be found in our "Notice of the Life and Works of J.-M. Querard." The author of an "Essai d'un Dictionnaire des Ouvrages Anonymes et Pseudonymes public's en Belgique au XIXe. siecle" [J. Delecourt] somewhat deprecates such an attempt as useless. But we consider that, even supposing such to be the case in one sense, it is exceedingly useful to the eye, by at once separating the pseudonym from the real name; and it has a positive use in certain cases, as, for instance,
when a writer uses his name written backwards, which, instead of being expressed by a phrase, is at once
expressed by a word.

The arrangement is strictly alphabetical according to Authors' pseudonyms. When partaking of the nature of a christian and a surname, the latter is chosen, though both should be looked for if not found under one. If, in the nature of a phrase, the first word after By, Of, or From is chosen, and it is catalogued strictly according to the alphabetical order of the letters, without regard to the meaning of the words, no inversion such as: Barrister (A): Author of, &c. (The): is used.

So much as is given of the title-page is given verbally and literally, and an abbreviation is generally indicated by ... or an etc. Information occurring between brackets [ ] intimates that such is not to be found in the book; between parenthesis ( ) that it is probably in the book, though not on the title-page. An asterisk occurring before a Title shows that the work was published anonymously. When initials only are used, search must be made under the first and not the last, unless there is some addition to the last, as: J. E. D .

The name of every author, if known, is given in full in one part or another of the book.

We have not confined ourselves to English and American pseudonyms: in fact, our plan is rather a wide one, for we include Alexander Dumas and George Sand: Boz, illustrated by Phiz: S. G. O.: The Times' Bee-mastee: Cham and * * * (The Abb^).

We could have doubled the size of this work by inserting the pseudonyms of authors whose real names are
not known to us. This is, however, no part of our plan, and when such are inserted it is generally for some special purpose.

When no place of publication is given, London is to be understood, and an author is generally of that country whence his works issue. So many American authors, however, now have their works published in London, that it is frequently a difficult matter to know on which side of the Atlantic the author resides.

We have to acknowledge the very great assistance we have derived from the admirable Manuscript Catalogue of the British Museum Library, in above two thousand volumes, folio, compiled during the last twenty years, under the direction of Antonio Panizzi, J. Winter Jones, and Thomas Watts, Esquires. To George Bullen, Esquire, and all those who attend to readers' wants, we owe our best thanks. After these, we think we are most indebted to the Athenceum, whose fearless exposure of any literary fraud coming under its notice has justly been relentless. But the want of a General Index has prevented us from thoroughly using the materials it contains relative to our subject. To Notes anol Queries we of course owe much, as must all future students, no matter what particular subject they pursue. And to several periodical publications, all specially acknowledgedMr. J. Bussell Smith has given us the full benefit of his long experience in our progress through the press. To many others, frequently the authors themselves, we are indebted for some interesting little revelations. Much has long been public property, though unavailable. We trust that we have, to some extent, rendered it available.

American works are so freely scattered through these pages, that we cannot conclude without one word on the want of a Copyright Law between America and England. How long will two nations with pretensions to civilization go on robbing one another in the most shameless manner? An excellent article on this subject by James Parton, in the Atlantic Monthly for October, 1867, has convinced us that in some instances we have been rather too severe on American piratical reprints.

*Universal catalogue of books on art (2 Vol.)* (1870) - John Hungerford Pollen 

*****
*Preface*

The Universal Catalogue of Books on Art contains titles of books on Painting, Sculpture, Architecture; on Mosaics, Enamels; hand-wrought utensils in all materials which show a decorative intention; on tombs, monuments bearing sculpture, and on decoration of all kinds. Books on Music are not included.

Books on Archaeology, as illustrating the ideas that underlie so many decorative forms and artistic compositions of different periods, and Books on Coins, often the sole authority for portraiture, and even illustrative of architectural monuments, are included. To these have been added books on Anatomy, composed for the use of artists, and works on Natural History full and exact enough to be of use to, or likely from their character to interest Art Students.

The mass of Art Literature consists of treatises, lectures, and essays on Art treated theoretically; of biographies and notices of artists; accounts and descriptions of monuments; and of remarks and criticisms showing the merits and defects of paintings, sculptures, utensils, buildings, or the like, and discussing the qualities and methods of various masters.

Thus the theory, history, and criticism, and instruction in the practice of Art form the subject-matter of Art Literature, and the catalogue includes books in which this matter is to be found. Much of such matter is in the form of monographs, scattered papers, or notices, published in the printed Transactions or Journals of Artistic, Antiquarian, Scientific, or Literary Societies, and even Popular Newspapers. These are sometimes valuable in the inverse ratio of their length and publicity; sometimes the number and consent of independent contributions throw light from their multiform character on disputed questions. Such contributions to the cause of Art, whether large and elaborate, or short and casual, have been catalogued as far as they could be verified, and references have been given where required.

To these have been added Voyages and Travels, or other books containing plates of monuments and costume, either as the only records, or as independent records, of much that interests the Art Student.

Care has been taken to collect the titles of works on localities of special interest, or illustrating special monuments, costumes, etc. ; and to notice copies which have been enlarged and supplemented by collectors with plates not forming part of the original series, when known to be in public libraries.

It has not been found easy to draw limits to the representation of the Art that has been used to illustrate Literature. The illustrated editions of the classic poets und favourite writers of ancient and modern literature, such as iEsop, Boccaccio, Ovid, etc., will, it is hoped, be found to represent fairly a succession of the best Art of this kind in all countries, from the time of the invention of block printing to the present day.

It has not been possible, hitherto, to verify the existence of illustrations in all the books understood to have them, or to examine their quality.

The subject of which this brochure claims to be a rather copious index has attracted much attention in all ages of literary inquiry, and, while it has sometimes provoked the wit and humor of the satirist, it has often engaged also the grave and earnest consideration of scholars and divines. The growth of this interest has been pari passu with the development of the spirit of philosophical inquiry.

With'the exception of Graesse's "Bibliotheca Magica," published in 1843, no comprehensive summary of the literature of Diabolism has been issued—certainly none has been offered for sale ; and we hope it is not presumption therefore to claim for this modest attempt in that direction whatever merit belongs here to originality.

To commend our labor to the approval of the bibliopolist, we have pursued a strictly chronological method of development, and divided the subject into two distinct parts, the one embracing its humorous aspects, and the other comprising the serious discussions and treatises which it has originated from the earliest times to the present.

The richness and value of the collection may be best illustrated by the mention of a few of the more prominent works. And first we name the extraordinary work of the Eomanists —their magnum opus on the subject—the Malleus Malepicaeum, the great prize to possess. Also, Mengus, Flagellum D-simonum ; Pererius, De Magia; Delrio, DisQuisrno Magicabum ; Guaccius, Compendium Maleficbium ; Bodin, Demonomania; Boguet, DisCotjbs Dbs Sobciebs ; Node, Ebreub Execrable Dbs Maleficiebs; Wierus, De Pbestigus, etc., etc. Besides these, we must note the great outspoken work of the honest Dutchman, Bekker's Le Monde Enchante; the learned work of the Frenchman, Oollin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infebnal; the exhaustive works of the laborious German, Horst's Zaubeb Bibliothek, and the recent classical work of Dr. Roskoff; of Englishmen, we must not forget the quaint and curious Bart. Glanvil, the dark deeds of Dr. Dee, the bold denunciations of Reg. Scot, the courageous Webster, the moral Yeron, the lucid Mason, the blasphemies of the "Devil's Chaplain" (the Rev. Robert Taylor), and the learned essay of that distinguished lady," Frances Power Cobbe. And of our own countrymen, the good works of Macrae, Read, Conway, Cranch, and Blauvelt, down to the laughable and enjoyable illustrated diableries of George and Robert Cruikshank, Landseer, Seymour, and others, as well as the amazingly humorous and sprightly works of the French. Nor have we omitted the Oriental Nations, here represented by Upham (Buddhist), Callaway (Cingalese), Lenormant (Chaldsean Egyptian), etc., for our aim has been, as near as possible, to obtain the best works of each country on the subject.

We believe that the introduction of many important books treating only incidentally of The Devil cannot fail to enhance the value of the collection.

The importance of this curious and extensive department of literary history seemed to justify and even to demand such illustration as could be conveniently and fitly supplied in the form of notes and quotations ; and the group of diabolislic proverbs and aphorisms with which it is accompanied will serve at least to amuse the reader.

*Preface*

It may perhaps be recollected that, nine years ago, the present writer published a Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature, being the earliest experiment of the kind made on anything approaching to a large and systematic scale. Few persons, and probably no one of practical experience, were surprised to find that this work was both incomplete and inaccurate; and that it was so was due to causes over which the author had only partial control. Where a book to be described was not accessible to him personally, it became necessary to resort to secondary authorities, all more or less treacherous—(1) transcribers, (2) earlier bibliographical publications, (3) catalogues.

Even professional copyists are naturally not infallible, and the mistakes arising from the necessity for employing them were both numerous and grave; but it was not in every case practicable to secure the services of such persons, and the help of amateurs was thankfully accepted.

Of my predecessors in the same field of work it becomes me at the same time to speak both respectfully and indulgently, and I shall confine myself to the general remark that Sir Egerton Brydges, Joseph Haslewood, the editor of the Bibliotkeca Anglo-Poctica, and other men of that period, as well аз some of their followers, do not seem to have regarded it as urgent or imperative to transfer to their own pages the particulars of the books which they describe with that literal exactitude which belongs to my plan. The consequence is,
that where I was led (from no choice of my own) to adopt the titles and collations ready-done (as it seemed) to my hand elsewhere, it has proved no economy of labour in the long run, as the whole ground has had to be traversed again, and the articles to be rewritten with the volumes themselves before me. (Considerable mischief has been done by persons who. under pretence of furnishing exact copies of old titles in reprints of books and tracts, have departed from their originals, not only linearly and literally, but verbally. Such is the case with nine-tenths of the reproductions of the last and present century, and it is well that it should be generally known.)

Since 1867 no undescribed, or misdescribed, book of my class has come within my reach—I might almost say, has come into the market—without being examined and catalogued, and in this way thousands of books and tracts have passed under my personal scrutiny. In the course of these years much has been added to our knowledge, as well of works, as of editions of works, not previously traced or recognised. My individual researches, which have beeu almost incessant, have resulted in the verification of many points which were in doubt, and in the discovery of much that was supposed to have perished. Ex pede Herculem—even a damaged leaf will establish the existence at oue time of an impression, perhaps a large one, of the entire work.

The present is emphatically an intermediate undertaking. There is no pretence or attempt to furnish, in every case, either the complete works of an author, or all the editions of his works, or every early English volume not included in the Handbook. The following pages represent the result of nine years' laborious and steady
gatherings from a variety of quarters, and, as such, are submitted diffidently to the favour and judgment of the public. These Collectanea, which may be considered as having substantially much of the value aud interest attached to a descriptive catalogue of a particular library, have a moral of their own, illustrating the extraordinary changes which have occurred in literary tastes and opinions, and showing the prominence which was once given, and the value once attached, to many hundreds of now forgotten and neglected authors or subjects.

For years to come (if he is spared) the author has no intention of venturing on so gigantic an enterprise as a new edition of the Handbook of Early English Literature, and assuredly now such an attempt would have been altogether premature. It is his wish and design to avail himself of every addition which may be made from time to time to our bibliographical stores, and ultimately to produce an entirely new and remodelled book, which may serve as a companion to an enlarged Biographia Britannica, the latter a scheme which was entertained by the late Sir Frederic Madden.

The volume now offered to the public is composed partly of rewritten matter, but chiefly of new. So far as the rewritten matter is concerned, it cannot be too distinctly stated or understood that, though it may often appear to repeat what has been already given with sufficient copiousness of detail, the information has been drawn from entirely independent sources, or, in other words, from the books described, instead of being taken unavoidably at secondhand. Not a single line of the Handbook has been reprinted totidem verbis, as such a proceeding would have been an unwarranted encroachment on the rights of the proprietor of that work.

It is understood, I presume, that a bibliographer does not treat it as part of his duty to draw the line of distinction too nicely between productions of intrinsic importance and productions whose principal value lies in their curious character and accidental scarcity. But I have occasionally pointed out cases where it seemed that too great a stress was laid on mere rarity as a recommendation, and I think that English collectors have still a good deal to learn iu this direction; nor would a Manual, not to be like Dibdin's Library Companion, but to be formed somewhat on the same plan, be ill-timed. A Key to the choice of Early English Literature, which should give sound and independent advice, and assist in dissipating the costly illusion that everything in the similitude of an old book is valuable, might prove indeed what the Library Companion purported to be, "the young man's guide, and the old man's comfort."

My own taste as to the choice of books is widely different from
that of the major part of our present race of collectors; and I like to look forward to the time when buyers or fanciers of such things will cultivate what is old, not because it is old and uncommon, but in spite of its antiquity and uncommonness. The aggregation of miscellaneous assemblages of literary gewgaws or emptinesses by undiscerning persons is surely a very unsatisfactory spectacle. Buy books if you love books; buy them if you are a student—if you are a reader; but, in the name of reason, do not buy them simply because your neighbour does. That is one of the least wise forms which flattery can take. The foundation and possession of a good, or even a fine library, rank among the most delightful incidents of cultivated life, and even some scholars (take Heinsius, Seiden, Burton, formerly, or in our own day, Buckle) have condescended to become book-hunters. But above every one we have to place the all-accomplished Heber, to whose enormous attainments Dibdin has borne some testimony in a well-known passage of the Literary Reminiscences. He was indeed "velut inter ignes luna minores."

Perhaps Bruuet goes a little too far in underrating the importance of articles, but it is the better and safer extreme; and it may be taken as a very good basis of operations by intending collectors or budding bibliomaniacs, that the majority of old books, like the majority of old pictures, and (in short) old everything, are comparatively worthless in a pecuniary point of view, while those which maintain their rank in the market have frequently nothing to justify the prices which they realise but the single circumstance that very few persons formerly thought them worthy of preservation. In fact, there are thousands of old English books which bear a disagreeable resemblance, in the writer's estimation, to waste-paper, and among these are the most costly and the most highly-prized treasures of collections in our day.

That there are exceptions, it is true. Some of the works of Spenser, Shakespeare, Daniel, Drayton, Bacon, exist for us in one or two copies, of which the worth is not capable of measurement
by any commonplace standard; but these are pieces of literature, not bric-a-brac, like the effusions of Nicholas Breton and certain other pamphleteers, from whom a few casual allusions, rendered interesting by circumstances or time, are all the purchaser gets in return for what would yield a small annuity. After all said, however, the five or six thousand articles which are comprised within the present volume belong to what was once a current and accepted literature—a literature which fulfilled a certain shaje in the important duty of instructing our ancestors and amusing them; and surely a faithful record and full descriptive account of such a body of material cannot be treated as superfluous.

Old English books may be classed under three heads—(1) Direct importance; (2) indirect or collateral importance; (3) bibliographical curiosity. Of these it may be said that only the first and second categories repay the attention of literary inquirers; and even as regards works of which the value consists in some feature not immediately connected with the writer, the interest is often so languid or so fractional, that it is apt to be exhausted in some judicious essay or in a descriptive catalogue. Articles which fall within the third and remaining section—bibliographical curiosities—are to be treated rather as cabinet specimens than as books, and are worth—what they fetch. They are liable to great fluctuations in their marketable worth, for the simple reason that their worth is as uncertain as an unknown quantity in equations.

The counsel which should be tendered to the forthcoming race of bibliophilists by some new Dibdin might with advantage, perhaps, be grounded on the principle of keeping in sight, in the formation of a library, the literary or intrinsic, in preference to the commercial or casual, qualities of the material employed, so to speak, in its construction. Curiosities rise and fall with the caprices of tiste and fashion; but standard books never vary.

An eminent collector, who buys rare and dear books, not because they are rare and dear, but notwithstanding their rarity and clearness, has remarked to the writer that the best books, for the most part,
are the commonest, and this observation holds true, saving a few isolated and exceptional cases, of the literature which possesses the highest claim to our attention—the literature which is intrinsically and directly important—important, not from^ associations which happen to have grown up round it, bat in itself and for its own sake.

Bookbinding is indirectly connected with bibliography, in so far as it exerts so. vast an influence over the selling value of copies. But it rather belongs to the Fine Arts than to literature proper, and it is a subject which I have rarely approached. Old English books with early decorated bindings of conspicuous beauty are, in point of fact, of such rare occurrence, that a descriptive account of all known examples would fall far short of filling a volume like that of Libri. Perhaps it is virtually nothing to the purpose that bibliopegy is treated by severely practical book-fanciers as the mere upholstery of the question.

A folio MS. in the library of Mr Henry Huth includes among its multifarious contents a catalogue of old plays, which becomes of curiosity, as it seems to supply the earliest record of the formation of a dramatic collection in England. It is to be presumed that the owner of it was Henry Oxeuden of Barham, and it comprised one hundred and twenty-one separate pieces, bound in six volumes. Among them may be recognised some of the most extraordinary rarities in our language, such as UdalPs Ralph Roister Doister, the Hamlet of 1603, The Tide tarrieth no Man, Marlowe's Dido, and others, which are entitled from their scarcity to rank as MSS. The list is printed entire in Mr Huth's forthcoming Catalogue.

In conclusion, I have extreme pleasure in recognising the assistance which has been rendered to me in the course of my nine years' additional labours by several friends, who allowed me to enrich myself at the expense of their information or stores to an extent beyond any claim I had on their kindness. I beg to mention especially my obligations to Mr Henry Huth; Mr Henry Bradshaw, who manifested the warmest interest in my imperfect labours, and opened to me freely the too-little-knowu stores of the Cambridge University Library; the Rev. H. О. Сохе, Bodley's Librarian; Mr Furnival, who sent me memoranda of everything he considered likely to be serviceable; Mr Henry Pyne, who afforded me constant access to his valuable collections, as well as the benefit of his still more valuable knowledge; Mr George Bullen, who greatly facilitated шу supplementary researches at the British Museum; Mr Sketchley, with whose kind co-operation I supplied certain important deficiencies in my original work from the treasures of the Dyce Collection at South Kensington; and the Right Honourable the Earl Spencer (through the good offices of the Hon. and Rev. F. J. Ponsonby, Rector of Brington), by whose liberality I have been again enabled to profit, as was the case in 1867. Dr Ingleby also supplied me with the titles and collations of some curious books in his possession.

Nor must I omit to record my gratitude to those well-known firms of auctioneers, Messrs Sotheby, Wilkinson, & Hodge, and Messrs Puttick & Simpson; and to Mr Pearson, Mr Ellis, Mr Pickering, Mr Quaritch, Messrs Nattali & Bond, and other eminent booksellers, for the facilities which they always afforded to me in the course of my researches.

*****
"A certain portion of my Bibliography of Ornithology has advanced so far toward completion that it becomes available in its present state for all practical purposes. It is accordingly published in advance of the whole work, as an appropriate and desirable Appendix to the present treatise on North American Ornithology. The plan and scope of this piece of bibliography should be stated explicitly, in order that those who wish to use it may know exactly what it does, and what it does not, contain.

It consists of the packet of titles representing the North American section of the “ Faunal Publications” series, including titles and digests of works and papers relating solely to Birds of North America indiscriminately, collectively, or in general. In short, the titles are those that relate to the Birds of North America as such—not as components of any genus or family. Hence are excluded, for example, all such titles as “A Monograph of the Tringew of North America”, which might seem to belong here; for such a title comes, in the “Systematic” portion of my Bibliography, under Scolopacidw. All general treatises on the birds of larger geographical areas, even if including North America (like Sclater’s “ Catalogue of American Birds ” for example), are excluded, as are also all general works on ornithology. By this means, the scope of the present article is conveniently narrowed and rendered perfectly definite ; and only in a few instances, for one or another particular reason, is the rigidity of the rule of exclusion relaxed.

The bulk of the titles of course consists of “local lists ” and allied kinds of articles. As a “ fannal publication ” may relate to any geographical area, from that of North America itself to that of a single locality, the titles embrace a range of publications from the works of Wilson or Audubon down to the
least note on the subject; and with them are also given, as separate titles, the reviews and notices which appertain. As already hinted, I give the benefit of the doubt to a few titles whose claim to a place here is doubtful, or which are of such mixed character that arbitrary decision is required; for it is well understood that a perfect classification of titles by subjectmatter is a bibliographical impossibility.

For present purposes, “North America” is held to include Greenland, Mexico, and the Bahamas and Bermudas; but neither the West Indies nor America south of Mexico.

The titles herewith presented, nearly or about one thousand in number, are simply those which I have thus far compiled for my Universal Bibliography of Ornithology; but they are supposed to be about 95 per cent. of all that are extant on this particular subject, and to represent some three or four per cent. of the whole literature of ornithology. The whole number of titles I have in hand at present writing is believed to be about 18,000. The present set of titles is arranged chronologically, with secondary alphabetization under each date. This method, I am persuaded, tends to the best exhibit of the subject in its natural connections and bearings, because the movement of the bibliography corresponds with the progress of the science; and any objections to such an arrangement are removed by the two indexes, of authors and of localities, by which any desired title may be found at once.

There is little to be said of the way in which the work has been done; for if it cannot speak for itself, the less said the better. It should be stated, however, that the compiler has habitually regarded THE TITLE as a thing no more to be mutilated than a man’s name; and that he has taken the utmost pains to secure transcription of titles verbatim, litemtim et punctuatim. It may be added, that, excepting in certain specified cases, 1w title in this Bibliography has been taken at second-hand.

The remarks which follow most of the titles have been made at the compiler’s discretion, and are of the most miscellaneous description. In general, however, they are in amplification or explanation of the title, rather than in the way of criticism. They are in general brief, and more so than might be expected in a case like the present; but it will be remembered that they form part of a commentary on many thousand titles, no one set of which is given preference-such extensive commentary demanding of course the utmost condensation.

Bibliography is never finished, and always more or less defective, even on ground long gone over. It is earnestly hoped that the errors and omissions of this piece of work may be brought by those interested to the compi1er’s notice. In fact, one object in printing the present batch of titles is to invite criticism, to the end that the final Bibliography may be bettered. The writer would be accurate; yet he feels the weight of Stevens’s satire: “ If you are troubled with a pride of accuracy, and would have it completely taken out of you, print a catalogue.”

With few exceptions, the books and papers here cited are in the Library of Congress at Washington. It is a pleasure to add, that I have enjoyed every possible facility of handling them, through the courteous attentions of Mr. A. R. Spoiford."

"Part First of the “Birds of the Colorado Valley”, etc., contains an Bibliographical Appendix (pp. 567-784, or [1]-[218] ), which consists of a “List of Fatmal Publications relating to North American Ornithology”, being the first instalment of a Universal Bibliography of Ornithology upon which the author of that work is still engaged.

The present article may be considered -to continue the subject, as it give." the titles of “ Faunal Publications” relating to the Ornithology of the rest of America.

The former piece of work has been received with great favor by ornithologists, whose kind expressions of interest assure him that his bibliographical material is welcome.

This further instalment of the work is constructed upon the same principles as the other, and with the same great pains to secure good results. Though of course much less extensive, containing only about 700 titles, it is scarcely less complete, and no less accurate, than the North American portion. The compiler takes this occasion to renew the request that those who are interested in the matter will point out defects which may be detected in any portion of the work now printed.

To those who may not be informed of the general plan of the whole Bibliography, he may explain that it is modelled after the “Zoological Record”, and that the titles given in this second instalment are only those which an editor of the “ Record” would have brought under the head of “Neotropical Region ”—a1l general and miscellaneous works, and all those upon particular species, genera, or families of birds, being excluded."

"The Appendix to the Birds of the Colorado Valley (pp. 567|1|–784[218), which gives the titles of “Faunal Publications” relating to North America, is to be considered as the first instalment of this work.

The second instalment occupies pp. 239–330 of this Bulletin, this Vol., No. 2, and similarly gives the titles of “Faunal Publications”. being those relating to the rest of America.

These two instalments represent all that I am at present prepared to publish of titles of this kind, i.e., in “regional” Ornithology. 

This present, third instalment consists of an entirely different set of titles, namely, those belonging to the “systematic” department of the whole Bibliography.

In this department come the titles of all publications treating of particular species, genera, or families of Birds, sytematically arranged by Families, in chronological order under each family, with alphabetization of authors' names under each date. The lot of titles here with presented. however, are only those that relate to American species. Of those families which are exclusively American, as, for example, Muiotiltidit, Icterida, Tanagrida, Trochilida, etc., I give, of course, all the titles in my possession; but of those families which are more cosmopolitan, as the Turdidae or Fringillida, I select only the titles relating to American species; and of extra-limital families no titles whatever are given. Such is the ostensible scope of the present instalment; but I actually give many titles relating to extra-limital species, when the close relationship of such species makes it desirable, or when the insertion of a few such additional titles enables me to present all those that I possess of certain families.

The three instalments together represent a nearly complete Bibliography
of Ornithology so far as America is concerned. They are published in this manner in advance of the whole work for several reasons— among others, both to render immediately available certain departments of the Bibliography which are practically completed, and to invite criticism and suggestions for the bettering of the work. I am satisfied that, if I can come anywhere near the standard I have set for myself, I shall have done a very useful thing; and I beg those who are interested in the accomplishment of this undertaking to inform me of any defects they may perceive. In only one particular would I deprecate criticism at present—and this is respecting the arrangement of the titles; for the scheme of the work cannot be fairly appreciated until the whole is published, including the several contemplated Indexes.

The portions of the Bibliography now before the public suffice for an estimate of its plan and purpose; but I may add that nothing has yet appeared of several other important departments, such as those of “General and Miscellaneous” publications, of publications in “Anatomy and Physiology”, of publications relating to “Birds in Domestication or Captivity”, etc. It is not my intention, however, to print any more of the work at present, the American departments being the only ones sufficiently perfected to warrant their leaving my hands. But meanwhile I am making manuscript for the rest as rapidly and as continuously as possible.

NOTA BENE: It being absolutely necessary, in this part of the work, to have some fixed standard (no matter what one) for the grouping of species and genera into famiiies, and for the sequence of the families, I have adopted as most convenient the arrangement of Gray's HAND-LIST, as far as the Passeres are concerned—the limitations of the families in other orders being sufficiently nearly agreed upon by ornithologists. For Passerine families, then, the titles have been assorted strictly and exactly according to the composition and sequence of those groups in the work just mentioned."

"The Appendix to the “Birds of the'Oolorado Valley” (pp. 567 [11484 [218]), which gives the titles of “ Faunal Publications” relating to North American Birds, is to be considered as the first instalment of a “Universal Bibliography of Ornithology”. ' .

The second instalment occupies pp. 239-330 of the “Bulletin of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories”, Vol. V, No. 2, Sept. 6, 1879, and similarly gives the titles of “Faunal Publications” relating to the Birds of the rest of America.

The third instalment, which occupies the same “Bulletin”, same Vol., No. 4 (in press), consists of an entirely different set of titles, being those belonging to the “systematic” department of the whole Bibliography, in so far as America is concerned. Here come the titles of all publications relating to particular species, genera, or families of American Birds, systematically arranged, by families, and in chronological order.

These three previous instalments represent a nearly complete Bibliography of American Ornithology.

This present, fourth, instalment of the work is of the same character as the first two: that is, it relates to “regional” or “faunal” as distinguished from “systematic” Ornithology; and it undertakes to do for British Birds what the first two did for American.

That is to say: here belong the titles of all publications treating of British Birds as such, exclusively, and indiscriminately or collectively. In publishing these preliminary instalments, it is necessary to draw a hard and fast line between those titles which are and those which are not to be found in each one of them-a line which would be very evident to one cognizant of the plan of the whole Bibliography, though by no means obvious at first sight. It is therefore necessary for me to be explicit here.

In order to fall within the scope of this fourth instalment, a publication must relate to British Birds as such. Secondly, it must relate to British Birds exclusively. Thirdly, it must relate to British Birds of more than one specieshgenus or family. For, first, a publication on, say, Lama glaucue and Tringa canu-tus as observed in Greenland does not belong here, though both these species are British Birds. For, secondly, a work on the Birds of Europe does not belong here, though including all British Birds. For, thirdly, a paper on the occurrence of Phala-ropus hyperborcus in Great Britain, or one on the habits of Lagopus scoticus, does not belong here, as the scheme of the whole work carries one of these to Plmlaropod'idw, the other to Tetraon-idw, in the “systematic” department of the whole Bibliography; though a paper on Phalaropus hyperboreus and Lagopus scotz'cus as observed in Great Britain would belong here, being a “faunal” publivation, and a “British” one.

This instalment, like those which have preceded it, is to be considered only in the light of published proof-sheets, to be canceled on the final appearance of the whole work. They are thus published in advance for several reasons-among others, both to render available certain departments of the Bibliography which approach completion, and are therefore useful as far as they go, and to invite suggestions and criticisms for the bettering of the whole work. This British list is prepared with the same great care to secure good results which was bestowed upon previous instalments, and it is hoped that the severe tests to which it will doubt’ less be subjected will prove it to be no less accurate than its predecessors have been found to be. Accurate, as far as it goes, I believe it to be; but I know it to be very incomplete. I do not think that it contains more than one-half as many titles as belong to this department of the Bibliography. I earnestly hope that the omissions, as well as any other defects that publication of my manuscript discloses, may be brought to my notice by those interested in the completion of the work.

There are numberless historical, statistical, geographical, agricultural, even political publications, which contain lists or other notices of British Birds, no hint of the fact being given in their respective titles; and it is my aim to include everything that claims to be ornithological by a formal heading of any sort. Very few of these “by-ways of bibliography” have been accessible to me in America. Nor have I ever been able to lay hands on a file of The Field, nor have 1 indexed certain periodicals past 1874. These sources, to say nothing of others I could mention, should yield upwards of a thousand titles not here given. I am so fully aware of the deficiencies of this instalment that criticism on this score would be futile. My manner of arranging the titles, moreover, ,is according to the plan of the whole work, scarcely to be appreciated as yet. But these two points aside, I ask for, and hope to receive, the severest criticism to which such literary work can be subjected. I should esteem it a great favor to receive back this pamphlet from its possessor with any errors corrected, any omissions supplied, or any bettering of my comments on the publications the titles of which are here given;
and I should be happy to recognize such courtesy by returning a copy of the whole Bibliography as soon as published.

In conduct-ing this work, I habitually regard THE TITLE as inviolable, -to be transcribed in full, verbatim, l-iteratim et punctuatim. In the case of a book, this means a transcript of the title-page, with vertical bars ( I ) to indicate the adjustment of the typography. With this is given the complete collation. In the cases of papers published in periodicals, I give the full title, with the page on which the article ends as well as that on which it begins, with illustrations if any-in short, all customary or requisite bibliographical data. Different editions of the same work, even if identical, are regarded as separate publications."

*Preface*

In the course of collecting materials for my "Handbook of Fictitious Names of Authors of the Nineteenth Century," I came across the titles of a number of works purporting to be written by "A Lady," the authorship of which appeared to be unknown.

It occurred to me that I might probably ascertain the names of many of the authors, and also proper descriptions of such of the books as I had not seen, and was unable to see, if I printed a list of them. As however, the essential points to be attended to, in the proper description of a book, are little understood, I thought it would be desirable to prefix to the list a few suggestions on the way to supply correct information. These gradually developed, so that I soon found the subject required more space, more time, and more consideration than I at first imagined.

In the hope that I might obtain assistance from others, and with a view to getting hints and exciting discussion, I wrote an article for "Notes and Queries," which was printed in the numbers for January and April of 1872, entitled, "How to describe a Book." I now go more fully into the matters that I consider require attention in the proper description of a book.

An explanation of the title of this essay will no doubt be looked for in the preface. It is very simple. In my searches for the Authors' names, the ladies in this list have resisted all enquiry in the most aggravating manner. Therefore I took the title of Aggravating Ladies as being concise and appropriate.

The information asked for relates only to English Literature of the 19th century, to which period I confine myself entirely. The anonymous and pseudonymous writers during this century being more than sufficient to occupy a whole life of laborious application.

I have not included in the list any phrases such as :—A Lady of Rank—A Lady of Distinction—A Lady of Hebrew faith—A Banished Lady—A Young Lady—A too generous Young Lady—nor, A Lady of distinction, who has witnessed and attentively studied what is esteemed truly graceful and elegant amongst the most refined nations of Europe (!) The pseudonym of the author of The Mirror of the Graces, or an English lady's costume [treating of]...taste...grace; modesty ...dress... ; rank...in life ;...of accomplishments ;...the mind ...means of preserving beauty...; by a lady, &c. London, Crosby & Co., 1811.

On the other hand I have inserted some titles which have been entered in different catalogues as by "a lady," when those words do not occur on the title. Such works probably being really written by a lady, the publisher naturally desired they should go forth with that impress of good faith and with all the prestige attaching to that talismanic little word.

As I have already explained, my list comprises only works published in the present century, whose authors are unknown to me. I have a longer list of works by "a lady," whose names are known, and who have therefore ceased to be aggravating. I do not give the title when I know the name of the author because I am now seeking not supplying information.

Another list as long as that I give at the end I have not printed, not having been able to see the books themselves so as to describe them from actual inspection.

I shall be grateful for information as to any of the works, or the lives of these Aggravating Ladies.

*****
*Preface*

The compilation of this Catalogue was. commenced at an early date, end was continued up to the death of its compiler in 1873.

It contains over 13,000 entries, comprising not only the books, pamphlets, and other publication in the' R>nalds Library, but also the titles of all other works on the subject of Electricity, Mugnetism, &с. which came to the notice of its compiler.

The titles are arranged under the authors' names, and the anonymous entries have been placed, with a slight attempt at classification, under a separate heading at the end of letter A.

After Sir Francis Ronalds retired from the direction of Kew Observatory, he lived for many years abroad, chiefly in Italy, hia principal occupation being the compilation of this Catalogue and the formation of his Library. He, consequently, had exceptional opportunities for obtaiuing the foreign works upon the subject, and the collection is extremely rich in such publications.

During this time it was one of his favourite pursuits to obtain as many of the Electrical works as possible which he required, which had belonged to those whose names have become eminent, and are identified with the subject. An instance of this may be given of the celebrated Volta's works, a large number of which he obtained from the Count Zanino Volta at great personal trouble and some expense. There are also in the Library many works which originally belonged to Arago, Faraday, Roget, and others.

Many of the most important works relating to Electricity, and, indeed, of most other branches of science, consist of papers contributed to the Transactions and Proceedings of scientific bodies, and


to scientific periodicals. These papers have each been treated as separate works, aml their titles are recorded under the author's name, a note being added giving the reference to the transactions or periodicals whero they may be found.

A considerable number of the titles have been obtained from booksellers' catalegues, and from notes and references in Electrical writings, and, where Sir Francis Ronalds has been unable to obtain the works, the souree from which the title was obtained is in most cases given.

The date and place of birih, and, where possible, of the death of rach author, have been added, the greater portion of these having been obtained from PoggcndorfTe " Handwörterbuch zur Geschichte dor Exactcn Wissenschaften," 2 vols. Roy. 8vo. Leipzig, 18C3. This work was also carefully examined, and those parts extracted which relate to Electricity.

As the binding of the books in the Library has only just been completed, it was impossible, owing to the want of arrangement of tho works, and to the large number of unbound pamphlets and papers, to refer to them to any extont for the correction of titles; besides which, there are between 8,000 and 4,000 titles of works entered in the Catalegue which are not in the Library.

The Catalegue is published without the addition of any new entries, such being the express desire of the donor of the Library, Mr. Samuel Carter. Great efforts were made to obtain his permission to make additions, and, as far as possible, to complete the Catalegue to the date of publication, but it is to be regretted that these efforts were unsuceessful. The Society has, however, at its disposal n large amount of material available for this purpose, and it is contemplated at a not very distant date to publish a Supplement, which will make the Catalegue more complete, at any rate as regards the more recent publications.

Great care has been taken to issue the Catalegue as free from error as possible, and it is hoped that it will be found as aceurate as the nature of the work will permit.

Thoro cau be no doubt that it was the original intention of Sir Francis Ronalds to present his Library to tho Royal Socioly (of which he was a Fellew), bat previous to his death it was represented to him that it would add but little to tho value of the Royal Society's collection, as they already possessed the greater number of tho books. It was further represented that as his name was so much identified with the subject of Electrical Telegraphy, ho would be eoulorring great benefit upon those specially interested in Electricity und the Electric Telegraph, by making tho Library moro avuilable for thoir use than it could bo in tho Library of tho Royal Society, in which placo it would be, to a great extent, out of tho reach of practical electricians and telegraph onginoers. Theso arguments did not fully prevail with him, as the Society had only recently been founded, and could at that timo scareely be said to have been firmly established.

Sir Francis Ronalds became ono of the oarliost membors of the Society, but, owing to his advanced age, ho was unablo to be present at any of its meetings. Пo died about two years after its fouudation, but ho had during this time some opportunity of seeing its rapid develepment, and no doubt this, coupled with the representations that had bocn made to him, considerably influenced him in tho disposal of tho Library. He died on the 8th August, 1878, finally bequeathing the Library to his brother-in-law, the late Mr. Samuel Carter, with a desire " that it should not be dispersed, but should bo preserved in an entire state, and so as to be of as much use as possible to such persons as from time to time should be engagod in tho pursuit of Electrical science and other cognate sciences."

Mr. Carter considered that ho would be host carrying out tho wishos of Sir Francis Ronalds by handing the Library ovor to the Society, which hedid upon Trust, the follewing beingthe names of the Trustees: Samuel Carter, Esq., Dr. Edmund Ronalds, John Corrie Carter, Esq., John Martincau Fletcher, Esq., Sir William Thomson, F.R.S., D.C.L., Latimer Clark, Esq., M.LC.E., Charles William Siemens, Esq., F.R.S., D.C.L., and Major (now Lieut.-Colenel) Frank Bolton.

There are several conditions upon which the Society retains the Library, the two principal being the publication of this Catalogue nnd the binding of the Library—the latter condition having just been carried out.As it was the desire of Sir Francis Ronalds that the Library should be made as widely useful as possible, it is the intention of the Council of the Society, as soon as the arrangement of the books is completed, to open the Library to the Members of the Society, and under certain necessary restrictions to the public generally.

The thanks of the Society are due to the Commandeur E. D'Amico, Director-General of Italian Telegraphs, M. Alfred Niaudct, of Paris, aud Mr. R. Von Fiscber-Trcucnfeld, for their kindness in having undertaken the correction of tho Italian, French, and German purlions of the proofs respectively.

*Preface*

The history of this volume is as follows. In the Colonies and India for Sept. 13th, 1879, Mr. G. J. Symons published a catalogue of works on Applied Botany, having previously contributed a letter to that periodical urging the compilation of such a catalogue. The same journal for November 22nd, 1879, contained an appendix consisting of the former list, with large accessions by Mr. P. L. Simmonds. Mr. Symons having added a few additional titles to the list, it was offered to the Index Society for publication, and I undertook to edit it. The work served excellently as a supplement to a journal, but required much labour before it could be considered fit for publication in a permanent form. I began by striking out colonial floras of purely botanical aspect, they having been far more fully dealt with in my Guide to the Literature of Botany. I also deleted all books devoted to Silk and Cochineal, as not being strictly within the limits of the title as settled by the Index Society; and most reluctantly the subject of the Vine, its culture and products, simply on the ground of its enormous extent. The bibliography of the Vine in all its bearings would require a lifetime for its compilation; I did not attempt to take up the subject myself: in the Index I have made some references to works which will help inquirers on their way, but the nineteen treatises which were cited in the original list were many of them only of gardening interest. I have excluded books and papers of simply horticultural, therapeutic, chemical, commercial, or manufacturing interests, unless they contained a sufficient account of the raw product, its cultivation, or whence obtained, to justify their citation.

Mr. Symons supplied me with about sixty cuttings from catalogues not incorporated with his lists. I checked these where possible, against the volumes themselves either at the British Museum, Linnean Society, Kew Museum, or elsewhere; if I could not find any trustworthy record, I rejected them unhesitatingly. I was compelled to examine every title without exception, for too great trust had apparently been placed on the catalogues whence they were obtained for me to reprint them. Many of the original entries were too imperfect to be retained; those which I could not supplement or correct were mostly struck out; a few, however, are still left in, but marked with an asterisk, to signify that I am in no wise responsible for their accuracy. I cannot here refrain from expressing my great regret that Mr. Simmonds should have contented himself with giving so many maimed entries from pamphlets in his own possession under the heading 'Anonymous' publications; a trifling amount of additional trouble would have made them quotable or recognizable.

In addition to examining the titles furnished me, I have added all I could conveniently within the time; but a complete bibliography of Economic Botany would need the labour of years. I have gone through the Library attached to the
Economic Museum at Kew, the Bibliotheca Historico-Naturalis from 1862 to 1880, the Botanisches Centralblatt since its establishment last year to the present time, The Pharmaceutical Journal from its formation in 1842 to the end of October last. Mr. H. B. Wheatley was kind enough to furnish me with the titles of articles in the Journal of the Society of Arts to the end of 1880, since then I have taken them out myself. Taken altogether, these entries supply a very fair startingpoint for almost every question in Vegetable Technology; the number of articles brought forward from the original list is 326, which has been increased, as noted, to 3580, exclusive of translations and different editions. One peculiarity of the old list was its paucity of works in the German language; this has been to some extent remedied in the present volume, as a book which professed to treat of forestry and ignored German literature on the subject, would be sadly deficient.

The Journal of Applied Science and The Technologist have not been regularly searched and cited, like the Journal of the Society of Arts and The Pharmaceutical Journal; for whilst confidence may be reposed in the statements given in these two latter journals, I could not confidently assert the same of the two former.

I have endeavoured to meet the wants of inquirers by compiling a comprehensive index. This not being an elementary work on applied botany, I have not attempted the task of determining the various products which appear under the native names, sometimes in different spellings; to have done so critically would have consumed months to very little purpose. The Index is designed to help in finding the books on a given subject, which are distributed under the authors' names, and more than this should not be demanded; a directory does this for persons, without trying to define the mutual affinities of those bearing the same name. It is hardly necessary to insist upon the need of searching all entries likely to give the information sought; thus, if an inquirer do not find his wants satisfied when referring to 'Materia Medica,' he should look up cognate headings, such as 'Drugs' and 'Medicinal Plants.'

I should have been glad to include a complete series of references to consular reports, also the selections of Indian papers bearing on Vegetable Technology, but I found I could not attain even approximate completeness therein. Consular reports are often quoted in The Pharmaceutical Journal, whence they are cited here, and a good series of the Indian selections is to be found in the Library Catalogue of the Royal Geographical Society. These publications are often regarded as ephemeral, and the department responsible for their issue rarely has a complete set.

Parliamentary papers have not been quoted in full, for in the majority of cases their value is commercial or manufacturing; in the Index, however, I have made references to suggest paths which may be followed up by those who want more than I have given. The formulae 'Refer to' and 'Refer also to' signify something outside this volume, whilst 'See' and ' See also' are ordinary cross-references.

The rules of the Index Society are followed in their spirit, the article preceding a name being used in the alphabetical arrangement, so that 'De Vrij,' and similar Dutch names, figure under the article, with a cross-reference from the substantive following. As in the Guide to the Literature of Botany, modified vowels and diphthongs are spelled out, a, 6, ii, becoming ae, oe, ue, and so forth.



The heading 'Anonymous Publications' has been much altered from its original shape. In the former list there were several entries which have been here reduced to their proper authorship; others have been excluded by the change of plan; many were too hopelessly defective to be here given. The system of cataloguing anonymous books at the British Museum is an excellent method of drafting off such ware into the Library, but it gives almost no assistance to the searcher. In some cases it is not enough to know all that the book itself states, as where a medical tract by John Pechie is entered under Sir John Micklethwaite's name, because, Pechie addressed his pamphlet "To the President of the College of Phisitians," and the cataloguer having taken the pains to find out who was President of the College for the time being, entered it under his name. The Old General Catalogue, with its common-sense entries, is far more useful for hunting up these books than the New General Catalogue, with its elaborate system of rules.

The abbreviations used will, I believe, in every case be recognized without giving a tabular statement—'Pharm. Journ.' for Pharmaceutical Journal, and so on. In this, as in Mr. Solly's Index to . . . Titles of Honour, and my Ouide to the Literature of Botany, the sign —> is used to signify 'in progress'; many of the abbreviations I was compelled to use in my Guide to the Literature of Botany are not used here, as I have been able to quote the titles fully, any omissions in the middle being shown by dots . . . , at the end by etc.

During the progress of the work I have been indebted to many friends for help on special points, for which I here tender my hearty thanks; but I must especially name Mr. C. G. Warnford Lock for much help afforded throughout, and for supplying many titles of papers and books which I should otherwise have missed.

In spite of inevitable shortcomings, I believe that this volume will prove to be of greater use than its predecessors on the same topics. Dryander's Catalogue of the Banksian Library, which is arranged most minutely as to subject, and the systematic portion in both editions of Pritzel's Thesaurus, are less convenient for reference than the one alphabetic index which closes this book.

*Preface*

THE first edition of Part II., of this Catalogue, embracing eleven hundred and sixty titles of books printed during the seventeenth century, was published in 1866. Since that time four hundred and eighty-two works of the same period have been added to the collection, so that the present volume includes sixteen hundred and forty-two titles.

In this edition the titles and collations are fuller, and the notes more numerous than in the former. The only change in the arrangement is, that the collections of the voyages of DE BRY and HULSIUs, which were described in the former edition, are omitted in the present. The printing of both these collections was begun in the sixteenth century, and the early volumes contain narratives of voyages of that period. Full bibliographical descriptions of these collections were therefore included in the first volume of this Catalogue, which embraces books printed anterior to the seventeenth century.

The compiler has deemed it advisable to include in this Catalogue the titles of many of the writings of the early theologians of New England, without which an American collection would be incomplete. The writings of INCREASE and COTTON MATHER are very numerous; and although many are of a religious character, others relate to the early history and colonization of the country, to the Indian tribes, and to civil and religious matters which have a direct bearing upon the government and laws of the colonies to which they appertain. There is another class of books of a theological character, including discussions of religious doctrines, which also have a bearing on the intellectual development of the people. With this view the productions of the writers of the seventeenth century mentioned in this Catalogue include writings of the MATHERS, JOHN COTTON, JOHN ELIOT, THOMAS SHEPARD, JOHN NORTON, WILLIAM PYNCHON, EDWARD WINSLOW, THOMAS COBBETT, THOMAS HOOKER, GEORGE KEITH, ROGER WILLIAMS, SAMUEL GORTON, JOHN CLARK, WILLIAM PENN, and others. 

Titles of books are given in full, with the exception of a few, chiefly German, which are very long. This plan has also been followed in the case of a few Spanish books, the titles of which are mainly devoted to the names of the various public offices and the literary honors of the author, of the dignitaries to whom the work is dedicated, and of the individual who permitted his name to appear as its patron. The long official prefixes of these persons often constitute three quarters or more of the title-pages of Spanish books.

The importance of the “Jesuit Relations,” which were published between the years 1632 and 1673, for the history of the great French empire in North America, of which the Dominion of Canada now remains the chief and undivided portion, has induced me to present these books under one head, beginning at page 164, and continuing to page 171. The “Relations” proper, begin in the year 1632; but previous to that year a number of small publications appeared, some of them as early as 1605, relating to the labors of the Jesuit Fathers. The titles of these, arranged in chronological order, precede those of the “Relations.” Other “Relations” of a similar character, and lives of the zealous missionaries embraced in the last thirty years of the seventeenth century, are also noticed.

Of the “Jesuit Relations” and other publications alluded to in the table, the titles are given in brief; but full titles and collations of all will be found under the respective years in which they were printed. The latter publications are all recent and are mostly printed from the original manuscripts preserved in the public archives of Quebec and of Paris; but, in giving their full titles, I have placed them under the years to which they refer; not in the year in which they were printed.

For these several publications the library is indebted to those distinguished scholars, Dr. JoHN GILMARY SHEA, of New York, and the late JAMES LENOx and Dr. E. B. O’CALLAGHAN, also of that city,
by whom many were edited, and at whose expense they were printed. For the larger works relating to the colonization and history of Canada, the student is referred to the writings of CHAMPLAIN, LESCARBOT, SAGARD, MARQUETTE, THEVENOT, and HENNEPIN; also to the Index at the end of this volume under the heads of “Canada.” and “La Nouvelle France.”

Every book and pamphlet mentioned in this Catalogue will be found in the Indexes, which are alphabetically arranged at the end of the volume. These should be referred to when the year is not known in which the books sought for were printed. One index gives the names of authors, the other of subjects and countries referred to

As in the former volume, facsimiles are given of title-pages of rare and curious books in the collection, of vignettes, printers’ devices, and portraits of distinguished navigators. - J.R.B.

*****
This historical survey of Botany belongs to the class of books which includes Sachs's 'Geschichte der Botanik' and Hoefer's 'Histoire de la Botanique.' Although written in Swedish, a language not much studied in this country, the book before us is commended to our readers on account of the care which Pastor Hogrell has taken to give a notice of every writer known to him; consequently the list of authors, especially British authors, is much more extensive than those cited by the French and German writers above mentioned. The preface acknowledges assistance from various friends in Scandinavia and abroad, who have supplied particulars in answer to the author's request. Ancient Botany is considered to embrace the period of R.c. 330 with Aristotle, to A.d. 1580, Hermolaus Barbaras and Leonicenus closing this list. Modern Botany thence begins, the first period being from 1530 to 1737, Csesalpinus to the first edition of Linnseus's 'Systema,' with sections 1530-1603, 1608-1671, and 1671-1735. The second period includes the whole of botanical progress from 1735 to 1885. The author treats his subjects to some extent geographically, grouping the several nationalities by themselves within each period. Following these, we find sections devoted to the history of morphology, anatomy and physiology, and then of special orders, succeeded by succinct sketches of systems of arrangement. Travels are next touched upon, and the book ends with notices of those who have appreciably advanced our knowledge of plants.
The book can be recommended as giving in a condensed form an immense amount of recent information
which no other work afford. - https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA122[B.D.J., 1887]

*****
*Preface*

The interest of this little work to book-lovers will, I hope, be twofold. At a time when local muniments are being examined and edited, and at last preserved from the wholesale destruction of past years; and when the Bill in the present session of Parliament for the enfranchisement of Copyholds provides by one of its clauses that the whole of the most important class of historical documents in this kingdom, namely, the manor rolls, shall be delivered up to the world of letters, it is time for the book-lover to take stock of what has been already accomplished towards printing these and other records. 

A further result of this little work is that the book-lover is able to place at the disposal of thinking men some idea of the extent of the literature of local institutions; and, by indicating how important that literature is, to urge that it should not be neglected now that current 
thought is so much occupied with the question of reform in local government. 

Local institutions have been the subject of study with me for many years, and I had hoped ere this to have published a long-projected volume dealing with their early history in this country j but my many avocations, official and private, havtprevented this cherished idea ever being completed. The materials collected for this undertaking, however, are of great value j and the books which have from time to time been consulted, form a branch of literature which is now being fully recognised as perhaps the only source of information on the social manners and customs of the people in the past. Nothing had ever been done to bring this literature together until, in 1882, in the B1blioGrapher, / gave some instalments of the subject. The interest excited by these papers encouraged me to proceed in collecting and describing books on the literature of local institutions, and the present volume is the result of these labours. 

It is useless to hope that my collection of titles is absolutely complete—so many books of this class have been privately printed, or else printed for purely local purposes, and have hence not found their way into the general market. The British Museum is notoriously deficient in this branch of literature. I have in nearly all cases consulted and used each work referred to. To many of the titles I have given special bibliographical information. Where such information is not given, it is generally because no practical good would come of such information. In some instances I am indebted to kind friends for references to out-of-the-way works, and I must particularly mention, at the risk of being invidious, Mr. J. Newman, Mr. W. Macmath, Mr. R. B. Prosser, Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith, and the late Professor Stanley fevons and Mr. Cornelius Walford. My visits to the libraries of the two last-mentioned scholars and booklovers will not be easily forgotten; and it was this subject which first took me thither. 

Of the faults, both of commission and omission, in this book, I trust a kindly view may be taken; and for any information helping me to fill up gaps, or correct errors, I shall be deeply thankful. Even as I go to the press, too late for insertion in their proper places, two very interesting additions may be made to the literature of local institutions, namely, a translation of Gneist's great work, which is mentioned on page 13, and Miss Toulmin SmitKs edition of Lady Caroline Kerrisoris Commonplace Book of the 15th century.

*A Bibliography of Printing* (?-1886) - Edward Clements Bigmore & Charles William H. Wyman

*****
"This three-volume bibliography of printing was published between 1880 and 1886 by E. C. Bigmore (1838-99) and C. W. H. Wyman (1832-1909), who had, unknown to each other, been working on similar projects and were brought together by the antiquarian bookseller and publisher Bernard Quaritch. The scope of the work, which quickly became a classic, includes 'typographic, lithographic, copperplate printing, etc., with the cognate arts of type-founding, stereotyping, electrotyping, and wood-engraving', but excludes the topics of paper and bookbinding. The three volumes are arranged in alphabetical order of surname of author; anonymous works are ordered by the wording of the title. Compiled with the assistance of such historians of printing as William Blades and John Southward, this authoritative work is of continuing value to bibliographers. Volume 1, published in 1880, contains an introduction and covers the letters A to L."

A popular encyclopedic history; by specialists, of whom at least, Maitland, Saintsbury,
Prothero, Oman, Bateson, Poole, Powell, Gasquet, Hall, Clowes, Mullinger, Griffiths, and
Keltie are authorities; poorly edited, unequal in value, often unscholarly, and inferior
in general interest to the old Pictorial History or to the illustrated Green, but exceedingly
useful as a book of reference.  Contents: v. 1, to 1372. v. 2, to 1509. v. 3, to 1603, v. 4, to
1714. v. 5 to 1815, v. 6, to 1885. - https://books.google.com/books?id=9VJBAQAAMAAJ[ALA, 1898]

*****
A stupendous undertaking devoted to the classification of the primary sources of medieval history.
No modern works are mentioned except those which explain the sources.  Only printed annals, chronicles,
etc. are noted which were written between 375 and 1500.  Printed archive material is rigorously
excluded.

Part I contains accurate titles and brief descriptions of all important printed collections of sources;
part II is an alphabetical list of medieval authors and their works, with lists of the manuscripts,
editions, translations and commentaries on each work.  A third edition would be very welcome.
For criticisms of the second edition see the review by A. Vidier in 'Le moyen age', IX (1896, 73-83. - https://books.google.com/books?id=J9AZAAAAMAAJ[Paetow]

*Introduction*

"If the Western Hemisphere hud been unoccupied by an aboriginal people, the story of its conquest by Europeans would have been quite different. Although the American Indian was the cause of the red line of conflict on the frontier, he made many contributions to our present civilization. Not the least of these were his agricultural plants, methods, and processes. It has been estimated that four-sevenths of the total agricultural production of the United States, measured in farm values, consists of economic plants that were domesticated by the Indian and taken over by the white man. The extent of the debt to the Indian for his work of domestication is emphasized when we recall that the white man has not reduced to cultivation a single important staple during the 400 years that he has dominated the New World.

In taking possession of the continents of the Western Hemisphere, among the first lands utilized by the Europeans were the clearings made by the Indians for their crude farms. The whites attempted to use their European crops and methods but found it necessary to adopt many of those in use among the Indians. Out of the union of American Indian and European farming came the first solution of the food-quest problem of the colonists and the beginnings of modern American agriculture. Herein lies the reason that, in any adequate study of the history of agriculture in the United States, the agriculture of the Indians cannot be ignored.

Anthropologists tell us that the remote ancestors of the American Indian came from Asia some 10,000 or more years ago, while in the Neolithic stage of development. At that time they had no food supply in the form of domesticated plants and animals, nor did they know how to use metals. Their only implements were bows and arrows, stone axes, and knives. The same was true of the tribes that remained behind in the Eastern Hemisphere. Eventually, each group developed a stable food supply from the plants and animals at hand, entirely ignorant of the way the other was solving the same problem. In this connection H. J. Spinden's chronological and economic diagram of the parallelism between the development of the civilization of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres is of interest.

For a long time the descendants of these first immigrants to America knew nothing of agriculture, but eventually tribes in the highlands of Mexico and Central America began the practice of protecting the plants relied on as their main source of food. Then, perhaps considerably later, they began to weed and, in a crude way, to cultivate them. Still later, they undertook systematic gathering of seeds and roots for planting in protected areas. This invention of agriculture in the Western Hemisphere, which occurred thousands of years ago, made possible noteworthy advances in human culture.

The flowering of the Mayan civilization—which began about 1000 B. C. - was based upon the economic conquest of the humid tropics. The Mayas not only modified the old series of plants to meet wetland conditions but also domesticated indigenous plants. The cacao plant, representations of whose pods appear as details of several sculptures at Copan dating from the fifth century A. D., was tended, and chocolate was prepared from its seeds. Other plants were also brought under cultivation, among them the papaya, the anona, the avocado, and the zapote.

As a result of the gradual spread of the cultivation of maize, beans, and squashes to the north and south, agriculture came to be practiced in widely scattered parts of the Western Hemisphere. The process of distribution was slow, for gradual acclimating of the cultivated plants to localities farther and farther from their original tropical or subtropical homes required many centuries. To supplement these nonindigenous plants, however, local plants were brought under cultivation in the several regions. In South America the most important indigenous plant was the potato, a native of the Andes. In the Amazon Valley, the manioc, the sweetpotato, the pineapple, and the peanut were developed as sources of food. For North America, above Mexico, the indigenous food plants similarly utilized were limited to the Jerusalem artichoke and the strawberry. Had it not been for their natural abundance, it is probable that the blueberry, the cranberry, and wildrice would have been domesticated.

)ramount among the food plants domesticated and developed by the Indian and given directly or indirectly to the white man is corn, or maize. The white potato was destined to become one of the world's greatest food staples, along with wheat, rice, and corn. Tobacco is one of the most important of our present-day cash crops. Other plants originally used by the Indian are agave, alligator pear or avocado, arrowroot, barnyard grass, the many varieties of kidney and lima beans, cacao, capsicum or chili pepper, cashew nuts, cherimoya, cocoa, cotton {Gossypium harbademe L.), gourds of all kinds, guava, Jerusalem artichoke, madia, manioc or cassava, mate or Paraguay tea, oca, papaya, peanut, pineapple, pricklypear or Indian fig, pumpkin. quinoa,s, squash, star-apple, sweetpotato, and tomato.

The adaptation of European methods to American conditions proved a problem of extreme difficulty. For several years after their foundation the first colonies faced starvation and survived only because of the supplies they received from the mother country and the food they bought or took from the Indians. The permanence of the colonies was assured only when they were established agriculturally, and this came after the crops and tillage methods of the natives had been adopted. Governor William Bradford told how Squanto came to the relief of the Pilgrim Fathers, "showing them both ye maner how to set it [corn] and after how to dress & tend it. Also he tolud them excepte they gott fish & set with it (in these old grounds) it would come to nothing."

The entire "maize-culture complex"—to use a term of the anthropologist and the sociologist—was taken over by the white man. The farm of the pioneer, whether in the seventeenth century or the twentieth, is a counterpart of the Indian cornfield. The ground is exposed to the sunlight by girdling the trees or scotching their roots, and the trunks and stumps are removed by burning. The kernels of corn are planted in hills 3 or 4 feet apart; beans are planted with the corn, and pumpkins and squashes between the hills. The soil is cultivated to check the weeds and to keep it loose and friable. Scarecrows—and sometimes children on platforms—are used to keep away the birds. In harvesting the corn, the husking peg is still useful. The corn is stored in slatted cribs upon posts to facilitate air circulation. When used for "human food, it is prepared in ways devised by the Indians. It must be granted that the white man has added machinery and animal power to the Indian method of planting corn and other plants of New World origin, but the native system of placing the plants in hills and heaping earth about the stalks during cultivation is still a fundamental process in farming, just as broadcast seeding is essential in growing the grains of Old World origin.

Several varieties of cotton w ere used by the Indian in pre-Columbian times. It is probably the only important cultivated plant which was domesticated independently in both hemispheres. Today the mainstay of the world's cotton industry is a native American species, Gossypiwm hirsutum L., which was cultivated by the Indians of Mexico. Besides llama wool and alpaca the Indian used several kinds of the maguey {Agave americana L.) and the Agave sisalana Perr., the sisal hemp, the piassava, the leaves of the pineapple, and the ixtile as sources of fiber. In northeastern North America the whites followed the Indian in making ropes and strings from black Indian hemp (Apocynum cannibinum L.) and the mark of the leatherwood (Dirca palustris L.). The Indian realized the properties of rubber. When the Spaniards entered Mexico they watched Indian ball games played in public courts and obtained balls as souvenirs to send home. A recent writer has referred to this incident as the beginning of the world's rubber trade.

Many vegetable products were gathered by the Indians but were not cultivated because of their natural abundance. Berries and roots were important sources of food and medicine. In contrast to our field crops, the American fruit industry is built mainly on fruits not native to this country. Of the common fruits, the following may be cited as native: Blackberry, blueberry, crab apple, cranberry, dewberry, elderberry, June berry, gooseberry (native in distinction from the European type), grape (excepting the European or vinifera type), huckleberry, mulberry (certain relatively unimportant types), persimmon (native in distinction from the Oriental type), plum (native in distinction from the Japanese and European types), raspberry (both red and black), and strawberry. The preponderance of berries in this native list is striking, and the absence of fruit trees is equally so. Two diagrams in the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1925 indicate effectively the relative importance of vegetables and fruits native to the United States and those introduced from other lands. Although the great bulk of the fruit grown represents varieties originated here, these varieties have come largely from foreign species.

The Indian had few domesticated animals. The dog alone was practically universal. In the Andes, the Incas had llamas and alpacas. The llamas were raised in herds, numbering thousands, and were not only used in transportation but were sheared for their wool and slaughtered for their flesh. Other domestications include that of the guinea pig by the Incas and that of the turkey by the tribes of Mexico and the southwestern United States, who kept them for their eggs and feathers as well as for their flesh. Bees were kept by the Aztecs, Mayas, and certain of the lesser tribes.

In aboriginal America, irrigation was practiced from Arizona to Chile. In the Salt River Valley there were about 150 miles of main irrigation ditches, and some of these have been incorporated into the modern systems. In Peru, irrigation was carried out on a scale scarcely equaled by modern peoples. The remains of the aqueduct systems of the Inca Empire show genius and organization which may well be respected today.

Artificial fertilization was widely undertaken. One of the most prevalent methods, especially along the Atlantic coast, was to place fish in the cornhills during planting. In parts of the area of intensive agriculture manures were used.

In North America, hominy, pone, sagamite, samp, succotash, and supawn are typical native dishes. Pemmican and jerked beef were first prepared by the Indian, and in the Great Lakes region wildrice was and still is used in such quantity as to make it a staple. The entire technique of preparing maple sugar has been acquired from the Indian, and his way of cooking clams by baking and of preparing fish by planking have been adopted. The folk foods of Spanish America are largely aboriginal in origin; so also are the drinks—pulque, mescal, chicha, and cachiri. Various methods of making more palatable certain fruits, herbs, roots, and game were learned from the natives. Chewing gum also came from the Indian.

Following the discovery of America, many of the medicines used by the Indians became popular in Europe (48). While some of these are now regarded as having little therapeutic value, others are still of prime importance. At first Europeans regarded guaiacum wood (lignumvitae) and sarsaparilla as the most important American medicines. Tobacco and copal were first introduced into Europe as medicines. In the American colonies the Indian doctor who knew the uses of herbs, barks, leaves, roots, and juices treated the white pioneers or taught them secret remedies. The natives of Bolivia and Peru chewed the leaves of the coca plant long before the Spanish conquest, and they realized its physiological action in diminishing the feeling of fatigue and in dulling pain. Observing these facts, the white man developed cocaine for use as a local anesthetic.
The bark and leaves of the witch-hazel were also widely used for soothing irritations. Cascara sagrada and quinine have proved their merits as remedies, the latter being an aid of inestimable value in conquering the fever-ridden tropics.

The Indian discovered and developed a number of excellent dyes. Chief among these was that made from the cochineal, an insect from southern Mexico which was domesticated and grown on the nopal or pricklypear cactus. Another important dye, also the result of domestication, was anil, or American indigo. In Central America the Indian used the secretion of the murex shellfish as a purple dye.

These, in summary, are the contributions of the American Indian to agriculture. Applying a well-known inscription—Si monumemturrb requiris, circumspice—to the Indian, we may close by saying "If you seek his monument, look around."

*Historians of the American frontier : a bio-bibliographical sourcebook* (1988, 840) - John R. Wunder

*****
"As a group, American frontier historians have been uniquely influential within and beyond their profession. Frederick Jackson Turner in particular stands out, but many others in the field contributed theories, hypotheses, and pivotal works that have permanently altered American conceptions of history. This new reference is the first volume to provide comprehensive information on the most prominent historians of the frontier. Fully annotated, it presents individual analyses of more than 50 historical scholars who helped to shape research, writing, and critical thought on the American frontier and American history in general. Each chapter is prepared by a different specialist and includes a brief biography, a complete summary of articles and books, and a detailed analysis of the historian's work. Historians of the colonial, trans-Appalachian, and trans-Mississippi frontiers are represented together with scholars who were primarily concerned with agricultural history, the Spanish Borderlands, land policy, railroad history, Native American studies, or other specialized subject areas. A valuable resource for students and scholars working in American frontier history and related fields, this book is an appropriate selection for historical societies and academic and public libraries."

"Anyone interested in Texas history will find Jenkins's bibliography indispensable. After fourteen years of research into the more than 100,000 books published on Texas since Cabeza de Vaca's Relación of 1542, Jenkins, formerly an Austin rare book dealer, author, and bibliophile, selected 224 books that he considered essential for any Texas library. The entry on each book provides a substantial critical essay and full bibliographical details on every printing and issue. An additional 1,017 books are discussed and appraised, and an annotated guide to 217 Texas bibliographies is included. This revised edition, now available at a new low price, includes more than 100 changes and additions to the 1983 edition." - https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Texas-Books-Annotated-Bibliography/dp/0876110863/[Amazon]

*****
"The enormous body of short story anthologies from the nineteen countries of Spanish America and Brazil testifies to their importance for writers, editors, readers, and, especially, for schools and universities, teachers and students. The study of anthologies and their contents can be particularly revealing for many of the questions looming large in critical discourse, particularly those on canon formation and the relations between literature and cultural institutions; but researching this corpus is difficult because it varies greatly in quality, distribution, and format. The present volume for the first time gathers this mass of material and organizes it for systematic study.

The main section comprises annotated listings of 1302 short story anthologies: those with stories from all or most of the countries grouped together, including a section of English-language anthologies; those from countries of a region; and those from individual nations. For most entries a full listing of contents is provided along with brief commentary. A second section comprises annotated bibliographies of criticism of the short story, similarly arranged with materials for Latin America as a whole as well as regionally and nationally. The volume ends with four indexes: of authors of the stories; of authors of essays, introductions, and other critical materials; of titles of the critical works; and of themes. An essential tool for scholars working on Latin American narrative, this bibliography will also serve as a practical finding aid for individual writers and stories." - https://www.amazon.com/Latin-American-Short-Story-Bibliographies/dp/031327360X/[Amazon]

*****
"Comics have become icons of U.S. popular culture familiar throughout the world. This huge bibliography, one of four compiled by Lent to cover all parts of the world, cites many publications in various writing styles, formats, time periods, and languages. This volume is introduced by famed cartoonists Mort Walker (Beetle Bailey) and Jerry Robinson (The Joker). The genres of comic art have had a phenomenal growth in recent years; the literature has grown with these developments, making this volume of interest to scholars of popular culture and fans alike. Featured are sections on resources, including an annotated directory of 128 comic art-related periodicals; comics collecting; portrayals of comics in movies, television, and radio; and relationships of comics with art, education and children, eroticism, ethnicity, humanism, the professions, violence, and war. Other parts deal with historical, business, legal, and technical aspects of comics. Two hundred and ninety-one comics-related personnel are singled out for special consideration, as well as 143 individual comic strip characters and 48 comic book titles under 13 genres. The foreword by Mort Walker deals with comics over the years and the topic of political correctness, and the introduction by Jerry Robinson gives a history of comic art. The indices are conveniently divided by authors, cartoonists, characters and titles, periodicals, and subjects. The other three books in this international series cover animation, caricature, gag, magazine, illustrative, and political cartoons in the United States and Canada; comic art of Europe; and comic art of Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, and Latin America and the Caribbean."

*****
"This book, edited by Wiget of New Mexico State University with the help of an advisory board, contains more than 70 essays by 52 members of the Association for the Study of American Indian Literatures. Do not be misled by the title--entries are not alphabetically arranged. Instead, scholarly essays are arranged by historical period: Native American oral literature, Indian writing to 1967, and from 1967 to the present. Each of the sections begins with an introductory essay by an advisory board member. The signed articles that follow, by scholars from the fields of anthropology, folklore, literature, and Native American studies, are readable and well researched. Each contains a helpful bibliography of primary and secondary sources. A single index combines subjects, authors, and titles.

The section on Native American oral literatures contains articles on such topics as the oral literature of specific regions, Native American tricksters, and myth and religion. The section on the emergence of Native American writing to 1967 covers such topics as women's autobiography and humor, followed by articles on specific authors (e.g., Black Elk, C. A Eastman, D'Arcy McNickle). The final section has essays on such topics as teaching Indian literature and critical approaches to Native American literature, followed by articles on such authors as Vine Deloria, Louise Erdrich, N. S. Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko, and James Welch. A few topical articles on issues such as Indian policy are included in order to provide background material.

This reference work has breath and depth enough to satisfy most users. Each of the introductory essays is a gem. Wiget's essay on oral literature has an accessible explanation of mimetic, genetic, and intertextual poles. Although this work could easily be used as a textbook, academic libraries, many high-school libraries, and all libraries with collections of Native American studies will need a copy." - https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-American-Literature-Reference-Humanities/dp/0815315600/[Amazon]

"A comprehensive, encyclopedic guide to the authors, works, and topics crucial to the literature of Central and South America and the Caribbean, the Encyclopedia of Latin American Literature includes over 400 entries written by experts in the field of Latin American studies. Most entries are of 1500 words but the encyclopedia also includes survey articles of up to 10,000 words on the literature of individual countries, of the colonial period, and of ethnic minorities, including the Hispanic communities in the United States. Besides presenting and illuminating the traditional canon, the encyclopedia also stresses the contribution made by women authors and by contemporary writers." - https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Latin-American-Literature-Verity/dp/1884964184/[Amazon]

"The Tudor era (1485-1603) was one of the most culturally significant periods in history. Under three generations of Tudor rulers, the era witnessed the advent of humanism, the birth of the Reformation, and the rise of the British Empire. The literature of the period is marked by complexity of thought and form and reflects the political, religious, and cultural changes of the era. This reference book surveys the literature of Tudor England. Included are alphabetically arranged entries for nearly 100 authors who wrote between 1485 and 1603. Some figures covered are widely taught, such as Shakespeare, Donne, and Spenser. Others are less well known, such as Edward Fairfax and Abraham Fraunce. The work includes entries for notable women writers of the period, many of whom have been neglected until recent years. Also included are entries for continental writers such as Ariosto, Tasso, Calvin, and Erasmus, whose writings were influential in England. Entries are written by expert contributors and contain valuable bibliographies of primary and secondary sources.

Included are entries for nearly 100 people who wrote between 1485 and 1603. The entries are written by expert contributors and are arranged alphabetically to facilitate use. Some of the authors profiled are major canonical figures, such as Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne. But the volume also includes a significant number of entries for women writers, whose work has been unjustly disregarded until recent years. While most of the authors were from England, the volume contains entries on figures such as Erasmus, who, though born in another country, wrote important works in England, and on writers such as Machiavelli, Calvin, Ariosto, and Tasso, whose works were almost immediately adopted, translated, or otherwise made part of Tudor culture. Each entry provides a brief biography, which is followed by a discussion of major works and themes, a review of the author's critical reception, and a bibliography of primary and secondary sources." - https://www.amazon.com/Major-Tudor-Authors-Bio-Bibliographical-Sourcebook/dp/0313294364/[Aaamazon]

"During the last two decades, African American writers have emerged as a distinct and dominant force in world literature. This force has been gathering momentum since the 1950s, when James Baldwin published some of his most compelling works and Ralph Ellison stunned the literary establishment with his dazzling Invisible Man (1952). Empowered by the Civil Rights Movement and revitalized by the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s, this force became more potent and pervasive. The publication of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye in 1970 was a major event in the literary history of the United States. With a voice as original as America itself, she began to conquer the English language and redefine the international literary landscape. Along with Morrison, scores of African American writers have mapped bold new territories and firmly entrenched themselves in the forefront of contemporary American literature. This reference book is a guide to the lives, works, and achievements of 79 contemporary African American novelists.

Through alphabetically arranged entries written by expert contributors, this volume offers lively, concise, and current information about these writers. Each entry begins with a biographical sketch of the author, provides a judicious critical assessment of the author's major works and themes, gives a representative sample of the critical responses the author's novels have elicited, and concludes with a selected bibliography that lists the author's publications as well as useful secondary material. Included are major figures, such as Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, James Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison. There are also entries for many noteworthy but lesser known figures, such as Tina McElroy Ansa, Bebe Moore Campbell, Randall Kenan, Reginald McKnight, Marita Golden, and Arthur Flowers. Some are popular writers with mass appeal, such as Terri McMillan and Frank Yerby; others, such as Octavia E. Butler, are known for their science fiction. Still others are distinguished poets or playwrights who have also published one or more significant novels. Of the 79 novelists profiled, 41 are women, and roughly a dozen have identified themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Thus the volume demonstrates the enormous diversity of these writers and the breadth of their contribution to world literature." - https://www.amazon.com/Contemporary-African-American-Novelists-Bio-Bibliographical/dp/0313305013/[Amazon]

"Thirty-eight experts from ten countries have critically annotated a selection of the literature within their respective specialties in the history of mathematics. The result is a comprehensive guide designed as a starting point for anyone wishing to learn more about any area of the history of mathematics. The 4,800 entries are arranged by subject, and each includes full bibliographical information. Annotations and introductory notes provide evaluation and context to help a user decide where to go next. As mathematics has had a long and rich history, the study of that history is broad ranging. This guide covers the history framed in all time periods and regions of the world beginning with the ancient Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Islamic, Indian, African, and Mesopotamian civilizations. It focuses on the branches of mathematics but necessarily gives substantial attention to the relationship mathematics has had with navigation, mapmaking, logic, philosophy, computing, and all the branches of physics. It also devotes special sections to such topics as institutions, societies, women in mathematics, and how mathematics has been taught. The success of the first edition in print showed the value of such a guide. It covered the literature up to 1982 and was published in 1985. This revised and updated edition, still very selective, has twice as many entries as the first, reflecting the enormous growth in the literature since that time. And the CD-ROM format makes navigating and searching the bibliography easier and faster. The CD-ROM's content is in PDF format with bookmarks, enabling browsers to link from the table of contents directly to sections of interest. Links from the author and subject index items to individual entries enable users to go directly to specific items of interest. AdobeAcrobatReader 4.0 with Search, provided for Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX, makes it possible for users to search text throughout the CD using PDF: the search term is highlighted, and you can move from hit to hit across files. This edition is unique in that it also offers a listing of World Wide Web resources, and live links within the text to selected Web sites. Overall, this revised edition of The History of Mathematics from Antiquity to the Present: A Selective Annotated Bibliography on CD-ROM now makes it easier for both browsers and researchers to locate and search for the extended number of cited works that have been selected and annotated for this bibliography."

*Guide to Standard Floras of the World: An Annotated, Geographically Arranged Systematic Bibliography of the Principal Floras, Enumerations, Checklists and Chorological Atlases of Different Areas* (2001, 1125) - David G. Frodin

*****
"This book provides a selective annotated bibliography of the principal floras and related works of inventory for vascular plants. The second edition has been completely updated and expanded to take into account the substantial literature of the late twentieth century, and features a more fully developed review of the history of floristic documentation. The works covered in this volume are principally specialist publications such as floras, checklists, distribution atlases, systematic iconographies and enumerations, or catalogues. In addition, some popularly oriented books are also included. The Guide is organized in ten geographical divisions, with these successively divided into regions and units, each of which is prefaced with a historical review of floristic studies. The book also includes general chapters on botanical bibliography, the history of floras, general principles and current trends, plus an appendix on bibliographic searching, a lexicon of serial abbreviations, and author and geographical indexes."

*A Cumulative Bibliography of Medieval Military History and Technology* (2001, 1128) - Kelly Devries

*****
"There is perhaps no other more lively area for study in medieval history than medieval military history, with its attendant and complementary field, the history of medieval military technology. In the past twenty years, it seems that more major scholarly inroads have been made in this field than in any other historical genre of medieval studies or chronological period of military history. What this has meant is that it is now more difficult to keep up with all of the trends and sources in the field than ever before. Hence the need for a reference work which covers what has previously been written and which, in turn, can assist the scholar, both the more experienced academic and the beginner, to improve his or her work in medieval military history or the history of medieval military technology. Utilizing library catalogues, bibliographies, and footnotes, this bibliography has compiled the most complete list of secondary references to works in medieval military history and the history of military technology. It keeps fairly strictly to a geography which centers on conventional medieval boundaries-Europe, Byzantium, and the Middle East. However, the chronology does differ from the conventional medieval dates. Because of its influence on the early Middle Ages, references to Late Antiquity, especially to the military history and technology of the third- and fourth-century Roman Empire have been included. For the opposite reason, the influence of the Middle Ages on the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, references to military history and technology up to 1648 have been included as well. This is especially important in the study of the Ottoman Turkish Wars and Arms and Armor, where the end of the fifteenth century as a chronological terminus makes little sense."

"There is growing popular and scholarly interest in autobiography, along with increasing regard for the achievements of African American writers. The first reference of its kind, this volume chronicles the autobiographical tradition in African American literature. Included are alphabetically arranged entries for 66 African American authors who present autobiographical material in their works. The volume profiles major figures, such as Frederick Douglass, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, and Malcolm X, along with many lesser known autobiographers who deserve greater attention. While some are known primarily for their literary accomplishments, others have gained acclaim for their diverse contributions to society.

The entries are written by expert contributors and provide authoritative information about their subjects. Each begins with a concise biography, which summarizes the life and achievements of the autobiographer. This is followed by a discussion of major autobiographical works and themes, along with an overview of the autobiographer's critical reception. The entries close with primary and secondary bibliographies, and a selected, general bibliography concludes the volume. Together, the entries provide a detailed portrait of the African American autobiographical tradition from the 18th century to the present." - https://www.amazon.com/African-American-Autobiographers-Emmanuel-Nelson/dp/0313314098/[Amazon]

"This work by Kanellos, professor of Hispanic and classical languages at the University of Houston, is a welcome addition to the numerous reference books on the literature of the diverse populations of the U.S. It is much more than a who's who of Hispanic literature.

Spain was the first nation to introduce a written European language to the mainland of what would become the U.S., and coverage begins with a detailed, readable overview of the records of Ponce de Leon's exploration of Florida in the early sixteenth century. The overview chapter ends with a bibliography for further reading. The chronology that follows begins in 1492 with the arrival of Columbus and traces the development of Hispanic literature and culture to 2002.

The bulk of the text is taken up by the chapter "Who's Who of Hispanic Authors of the United States," which consists of alphabetical entries, between 150 and 500 words in length, for more than 100 authors. Succeeding chapters discuss "Significant Trends, Movements, and Themes" (for example, the Nuyorican poets, indigenous writings, and immigration) and "Publishing Trends." This chapter is particularly enlightening as it discusses Spanish-language newspapers from all of the states with large Hispanic populations and the small presses that were significant in the careers of such luminaries as Sandra Cisneros and Ana Castillo. A chapter specifically detailing the history of Hispanic drama is also included.

Students, faculty, and collection development librarians will appreciate the list of "100 Essential Hispanic Literary Works" and the select bibliography. Title and subject indexes complete the work, which is recommended for public, high-school, and undergraduate collections." - https://www.amazon.com/Hispanic-Literature-United-States-Comprehensive/dp/157356558X/[RBB]

"The Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature is a two-volume work that contains some 540 entries on erotic literature on an international scale. The Encyclopedia has an unprecedented scope, the first scholarly reference resource to bring the field together in all its fascinating variety. The entries examine the history of the literature in different countries and languages from classical antiquity to the present day, individual writers from around the world (not all of them necessarily known as specialist writers of erotic literature), significant works, genres and critical approaches, and general themes pertinent to erotic literature (nudity, prostitution, etc.).

The definition of erotic literature is broad, encompassing all the material recognized in the study of the field: not just fiction in all genres (novels, poetry, short stories, drama), but also essays, autobiographies, treatises and sex manuals from different cultures. This Encyclopedia deals with sexually explicit texts characterized by sexual representations and suggestions. All types of sexuality are included." - https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Erotic-Literature-Ga%C3%ABtan-Brulotte/dp/1579584411/[Amazon]

"Part of the Facts On File Literary Movements series, this volume is an introduction to the "works produced by the Beat writers and their allied contemporaries." It treats writers and their "best, most famous, and most innovative" novels, memoirs, poetry, essays, and short stories. The Beat Generation is defined here as extending from 1944 to 1967, but writers who influenced or were deeply influenced by the Beats are included as well, among them Bob Dylan and John Lennon. Arrangment is alphabetical, and entries are usually around a page to a page and a half long, although those for the well-known authors William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac extend for multiple pages. Each entry concludes with a bibliography for more information. Some entries include black-and-white photos. Following the entries are an afterword summarizing the Beats' influence; a selected bibliography of major works, arranged by author; a selected bibliography of secondary resources; a chronology; and an index. The Beat Generation (2003), part of the Gale Critical Companion series, covers the literature in greater depth. Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact (ABC-CLIO, 2005) has entries for cultural and historical themes and musicians and artists as well as writers. The Facts On File volume is meant to be an overview of major contributors to the Beat movement, and it is recommended for literature collections."  - https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Beat-Literature-Literary-Movements/dp/0816042977/[Jennifer Dawson]

"For much of its history, children's literature has been overlooked or looked down on by scholars. But in recent years children's literature has assumed greater importance, as literary critics, psychologists, anthropologists, and historians have begun to discover what children and parents have known for centuries: that this is a literature of extraordinary richness, depth, and delight.

The Encyclopedia captures and elucidates this richness in four volumes and 3,200 signed entries. It offers comprehensive coverage of children's literature, from medieval chapbooks of moral instruction for children to J. K. Rowling's immensely popular Harry Potter books. Unlike other references, the Encyclopedia not only documents but also interprets every work, major and minor, that has played a role in the history of children's literature in the world. General essays illuminate prominent trends, themes, genres, and the traditions of children's literature in many countries. In addition, the Encyclopedia provides biographies of important writers, as well as extensive coverage of illustrators with numerous examples of their work. Sociocultural developments such as the impact of toys, films, animation, the Internet, literacy, libraries and librarians, censorship, the multicultural expansion of the field, and other issues related to the appreciation and dissemination of children's literature are also addressed.

While the Encyclopedia concentrates on the tradition known best by its readership, it also covers the international development of children's literature and offers an unprecedented treatment of works from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, African countries, and other nations. Its over 800 distinguished contributors come from around the world and include such renowned scholars and writers as Gillian Avery, Peter Hunt, Klaus Doderer, Hansa Heino Ewers, Jean Perrot, Denise Escarpit, Brian Alderson, and Betsy Gould Hearne.

A-Z organization, accessible writing, plentiful illustrations, cross-references, bibliographies, a comprehensive index and a systematic outline make the Encyclopedia an invaluable and easy-to-use research reference." - https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Encyclopedia-Childrens-Literature-Set/dp/0195146565/[Amazon]

*Culinary Landmarks: A Bibliography of Canadian Cookbooks, 1825-1949* (2008, 1257) - Elizabeth Driver +
https://books.google.com/books?id=B40ZbsCTjx4C[+https://books.google.com/books?id=B40ZbsCTjx4C+]

*****
"Culinary Landmarks is a definitive history and bibliography of Canadian cookbooks from the beginning, when La cuisinière bourgeoise was published in Quebec City in 1825, to the mid-twentieth century. Over the course of more than ten years Elizabeth Driver researched every cookbook published within the borders of present-day Canada, whether a locally authored text or a Canadian edition of a foreign work. Every type of recipe collection is included, from trade publishers' bestsellers and advertising cookbooks, to home economics textbooks and fund-raisers from church women's groups.

The entries for over 2,200 individual titles are arranged chronologically by their province or territory of publication, revealing cooking and dining customs in each part of the country over 125 years. Full bibliographical descriptions of first and subsequent editions are augmented by author biographies and corporate histories of the food producers and kitchen-equipment manufacturers, who often published the books. Driver's excellent general introduction sets out the evolution of the cookbook genre in Canada, while brief introductions for each province identify regional differences in developments and trends. Four indexes and a 'Chronology of Canadian Cookbook History' provide other points of access to the wealth of material in this impressive reference book."

"In this encyclopedia, a project of the Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage program, well-respected Hispanic scholar, publisher, and editor Kanellos brings together hundreds of entries on Latino authors as well as concepts, themes, movements, genres, events, and organizations that have shaped this literature from colonial times to the present. Aiming to cover the broad spectrum that is Latino literature, more than 700 entries range from a single paragraph to several pages, and each is written in a style that is not only accessible to those with a passing interest but also provides enough information for a comprehensive understanding of the topic and its importance.  Arranged in an A–Z format, each entry is written and signed by one of 60 expert contributors and followed by further-reading suggestions for continued study. The general bibliography in volume 3, though robust, lacks Internet resources and contains many items published in the last century. Each volume contains a list of entries as well as a guide to related topics, a nice feature for students starting a research project. Although Latino literature is itself centered in the U.S. and both the advisory board and contributors are predominantly American, specifically from the Southwest, they also include Cubans, Mexicans, and other nationalities, giving the material a well-rounded viewpoint.  Facts On File’s single-volume Encyclopedia of Hispanic-American Literature (2008) has entries for individual works as well as authors, movements, etc., and it serves as a good introduction for students, especially since it is tied to what is taught in high-school and college classrooms. Covering many more authors, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature provides important information for scholars and general readers alike and is an excellent addition to public and academic libraries." - https://www.amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-Latino-Literature-volumes/dp/0313339708/[Asia Gross]

"Offering a comprehensive view of the South's literary landscape, past and present, this volume of The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture celebrates the region's ever-flourishing literary culture and recognizes the ongoing evolution of the southern literary canon. As new writers draw upon and reshape previous traditions, southern literature has broadened and deepened its connections not just to the American literary mainstream but also to world literatures--a development thoughtfully explored in the essays here.

Greatly expanding the content of the literature section in the original Encyclopedia, this volume includes 31 thematic essays addressing major genres of literature; theoretical categories, such as regionalism, the southern gothic, and agrarianism; and themes in southern writing, such as food, religion, and sexuality. Most striking is the fivefold increase in the number of biographical entries, which introduce southern novelists, playwrights, poets, and critics. Special attention is given to contemporary writers and other individuals who have not been widely covered in previous scholarship."

"Distinguished linguistics scholar Anatoly Liberman set out the frame for this volume in An Analytic Dictionary of English Etymology. Here, Liberman's landmark scholarship lay the groundwork for his forthcoming multivolume analytic dictionary of the English language. A Bibliography of English Etymology is a broadly conceptualized reference tool that provides source materials for etymological research. For each word's etymology, there is a bibliographic entry that lists the word origin's primary sources, specifically, where it was first found in use. Featuring the history of more than 13,000 English words, their cognates, and their foreign antonyms, this is a full-fledged compendium of resources indispensable to any scholar of word origins."

*****
"Shakespeare was incredibly popular in nineteenth-century America, where the theater was both a source of entertainment and debating ground for those with differing political opinions.

Just as popular as the Bard’s works—or perhaps more so—were the many burlesques and parodies of Shakespeare, especially in the 1840s, when relationships between the United States and Great Britain were strained at best.

The use of Shakespearian parodies to score political points was common on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United Sates, the great Shakespearian rivalry erupted in New York’s Astor Place Riot, an event sparked by the working class love of an American actor over New York gentility’s support of his British rival. The resulting chaos left dozens of people dead, many more injured, and cemented the division of American theater productions by class.

In The Bard Debunked, authors Claudia Durst Johnson and Henry E. Jacobs offer a humorous but comprehensive annotated bibliography of nineteenth-century Shakespearian burlesques, supported by an insightful opening article explaining the role such parodies had in shaping American views on social class, world politics, and Shakespeare himself." - https://www.amazon.com/Bard-Debunked-Annotated-Bibliography-Shakespeare/dp/1508554307/[Amazon]

"This Companion offers a comprehensive account of the influence of contemporary British Black and Asian writing in British culture. While there are a number of anthologies covering Black and Asian literature, there is no volume that comparatively addresses fiction, poetry, plays and performance, and provides critical accounts of the qualities and impact within one book. It charts the distinctive Black and Asian voices within the body of British writing and examines the creative and cultural impact that African, Caribbean and South Asian writers have had on British literature. It analyzes literary works from a broad range of genres, while also covering performance writing and non-fiction. It offers pertinent historical context throughout, and new critical perspectives on such key themes as multiculturalism and evolving cultural identities in contemporary British literature. This Companion explores race, politics, gender, sexuality, identity, amongst other key literary themes in Black and Asian British literature." - https://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Companion-Literature-1945-2010-Companions/dp/1107139244/[Amazon]
