Agastache rugosa (purple giant hyssop, Korean mint, blue licorice)
------------------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Agastache rugosa, the Korean mint, also known as blue licorice, purple giant hyssop, Indian mint, wrinkled giant hyssop, huo xiang, and Chinese patchouli, is an aromatic herb in the mint family, native to East Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Russian Primorye, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam).

Korean mint is a perennial plant growing up to 40–100 cm (16–39 in) tall, with square stalks that branch at the upper part. The oval-cordate leaves are oppositely arranged, 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long and 3–7 cm (1 1⁄4–2 3⁄4 in) broad, with coarsely serrated margins. Some leaves have hair and/or touches of white on the underside.

From July to September, purple bilabiate flowers bloom in verticillasters that are 5–15 cm (2–6 in) long and 2 cm (3⁄4 in) broad. The calyx is 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long, with five narrow triangular lobes. The petals are 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long, lower ones longer and the ones inside serrated. The stamens are didynamous, long, and exposed. The fruit is schizocarp, with obovate elliptical mericaps of 1.8 mm (0.071 in).

Korean mint grows well in fertile, moisture-retentive soils and good sunlight. The aroma becomes weaker in shady conditions.

Korean mint can be propagated by both sexual and asexual means. The seeds gathered in autumn can be sown in the spring. One can also dig out the plant in autumn or early spring, divide the roots, and plant them at intervals of 30 centimetres (12 in). 

There is one known cultivar, Agastache rugosa 'Golden Jubilee', which has yellow-green foliage.

The plant's Korean name is baechohyang (배초향), but it is more commonly known as banga (방아) in southern parts of Korea, where the herb is extensively cultivated and consumed. In southern Korean cuisine, the herb is a popular last minute addition to various dishes, such as chueo-tang (pond loach stew), and maeun-tang (spicy fish stew). It is also sometimes used as the main ingredient in buchimgae (Korean pancakes)." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agastache_rugosa[Wikipedia]

Atriplex hortensis (Orach 'aurora')
-----------------------------------

*Overview*

"Atriplex hortensis, known as garden orache, red orache or simply orache (/ˈɒrətʃ/; also spelled orach), mountain spinach, French spinach, or arrach, is a species of plant in the amaranth family used as a leaf vegetable that was common before spinach and still grown as a warm-weather alternative to that crop. (For many years, it was classified in the goosefoot family, but it has now been absorbed into the Amaranthaceae.) It is Eurasian, native to Asia and Europe, and widely naturalized in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.

Atriplex hortensis is a hardy annual plant, with an erect, branching stem. It varies in height from two to six feet, according to the variety and soil. The leaves are variously shaped, but somewhat oblong, comparatively thin, and slightly acidic to the taste. The flowers are small and obscure, greenish or reddish, corresponding to a degree with the color of the foliage of the plant. The seeds are small, black, surrounded by a thin, pale-yellow membrane, and they retain their viability for three years. There are varieties with red, white and green leaves. 

Atriplex hortensis has a salty, spinach-like taste. The leaves are used cooked or raw in salads. The green leaves were once used to color pasta in Italy. A common use of the plant is to balance out the acidic flavor of sorrel.

It was commonly grown in Mediterranean regions from early times, until spinach became the more favored leaf vegetable. It is commonly grown as a warm-weather alternative to spinach because it is more tolerant of heat and slower to bolt in warm weather." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atriplex_hortensis[Wikipedia]

Barbarea verna (land cress)
---------------------------

*Overview*

"Land cress (Barbarea verna), also known as American cress, bank cress, black wood cress, Belle Isle cress, Bermuda cress, early yellowrocket, early wintercress, scurvy cress, creasy greens, and upland cress, is a biennial herb in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and naturalized elsewhere It has been cultivated as a leaf vegetable in England since the 17th century. As it requires less water than watercress, it is easier to cultivate. 

Land cress is considered a satisfactory substitute for watercress. It can be used in sandwiches, or salads, or cooked like spinach, or used in soup and fish.

Land cress can be grown easily in any garden. Like watercress, it loves water, but does not do well when partially submerged for long periods of time. This perennial needs full sun and frequent watering in any garden, unless near a direct source of water.

Other common names include dryland cress, cassabully, and American watercress. A variegated
form is available." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarea_verna[Wikipedia]

Brassica carinata (texsel greens)
---------------------------------

*Overview*

"Brassica carinata (Ethiopian rape, Ethiopian mustard, Abyssinian mustard) is a member of the genus Brassica. It is believed to be a hybrid between Brassica nigra and Brassica oleracea. Although Brassica carinata is cultivated as an oilseed crop in Ethiopia, it has high levels of undesirable glucosinolates and erucic acid. The closely related Brassica napus (Rapeseed) is considered a better oilseed crop in comparison.

The plant has a mild flavor, and is eaten as a leaf vegetable. The flowers attract honey bees to collect pollen and nectar.

It is known as yabesha gomen in Amharic. Named varieties include Texsel, which is particularly adapted to temperate climates." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_carinata[Wikipedia]

*****
"Texsel is especially good for temperate climates, it is fast growing even at relatively low temperatures. A fairly hardy, mild cabbage flavor, nutritious greens type originating from Ethiopian Mustard. Chopped finely and used in mixed salads or eaten cooked. Fast growing and popular for salad leaves if cut young and tender under 12” tall. Older leaves are cooked like cabbage leaves. Immature flower stems are cooked like broccoli. Also known as Ethiopian kale, Ethiopian mustard, Ethiopian rape and Abyssinian mustard. Seeds can also be crushed and used as a condiment.

The center of biological diversity for Texsel Greens is east central Africa. Cultivation is thought to have started there about 4000 years BC. Brassica carinata is a member of the Triangle of U species in the agriculturally significant Brassica genus. It has 34 chromosomes with genome composition BBCC, and is thought to result from an ancestral hybridisation event between Brassica nigra, genome composition BB, and Brassica oleracea."

Brassica napobrassica (rutabaga)
--------------------------------

*Overview*

"The rutabaga (North American English), swede (Commonwealth English), or neep (Scottish and Northern English), also called by several other names in different regions (including turnip, though this elsewhere usually refers to the "white turnip"), is a root vegetable that originated as a cross between the cabbage and the turnip. The roots are eaten in a variety of ways, and the leaves can be eaten as a leaf vegetable. The roots and tops are also used as winter feed that is fed directly or that livestock can forage in the field during the other seasons. Scotland and Ireland have a tradition of carving rutabagas ("swedes/neeps") into lanterns at Halloween. 

Rutabaga has many national and regional names. Rutabaga is the common North American term for the plant. This comes from the Swedish dialectal word rotabagge, from rot (root) + bagge (lump, bunch). In the U.S., the plant is also known as Swedish turnip or yellow turnip.

Rutabaga has a complex taxonomic history. The earliest account comes from the Swiss botanist Gaspard Bauhin, who wrote about it in his 1620 Prodromus. Brassica napobrassica was first validly published by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum as a variety of B. oleracea: B. oleracea var. napobrassica. It has since been moved to other taxa as a variety, subspecies, or elevated to species rank. In 1768, a Scottish botanist elevated Linnaeus' variety to species rank as Brassica napobrassica in The Gardeners Dictionary, which is the currently accepted name.

Rutabaga has a chromosome number of 2n = 38. It originated from a cross between turnip (Brassica rapa) and Brassica oleracea. The resulting cross then doubled its chromosomes, becoming an allopolyploid. This relationship was first published by Woo Jang-choon in 1935 and is known as the Triangle of U.

In Scotland, separately boiled and mashed, rutabagas (neeps) and potatoes are served as "neeps and tatties" ("tatties" being the Scots word for potatoes), in a traditional Burns supper, together with the main course of haggis (the Scottish national dish). Neeps mashed with carrots or potatoes is called clapshot. In Orkney neeps mashed with potatoes (tatties) is called clapshot. Roughly equal quantities of neeps and tatties are boiled together in salted water and mashed with lots of butter. Seasoning can be augmented with black pepper. Onions are never used. Regionally, neeps are a common ingredient in soups and stews. 

As with watercress, mustard greens, turnip, broccoli and horseradish, human perception of bitterness in rutabaga is governed by a gene affecting the TAS2R bitter receptor, which detects the glucosinolates in rutabaga. Sensitive individuals with the genotype PAV/PAV (supertasters) find rutabaga twice as bitter as insensitive subjects (AVI/AVI). For the mixed type (PAV/AVI), the difference is not significant for rutabaga. As a result, sensitive individuals may find some rutabagas too bitter to eat." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutabaga[Wikipedia]

*****
"Swede is an excellent autumn and winter vegetable. In the past it has been undervalued but recently this crop is going through a mini revival, increasing in acreage by some 30% in the UK in recent years.
Swede Marian is the Swede to buy. Bred in Wales this high yielding variety in NIAB trials has all the plus points. This reliable cropper will produce uniform purple topped, globe shaped roots with yellow flesh, a splendid flavour and fine texture with the bonus of resistance to club root and mildew.

It is one of the easiest vegetables to grow and well-suited to the novice gardener. All you have to do is sprinkle some seeds in late spring or early summer, thin a few weeks later and then lift the large, globular roots as you need them from autumn until spring. This frost-tolerant, hardy plant thrives in moist soil. It crops over a long period of time and can be left in the ground through winter. Few other crops are quite so straightforward.

Swedes, also known as Rutabaga is a cross between cabbage and turnip (the name is an abbreviation of ‘Swedish turnip’), the flesh is more yellow and the flavour both milder and sweeter. There are other differences – the plants are hardier, the yields are greater and the growing period is longer."

Brassica napus (rapeseed, rape, canola)
---------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Rapeseed (Brassica napus), also known as rape, oilseed rape, and, in the case of one particular group of cultivars, canola, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed. It is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and second-largest source of protein meal in the world. 

The term "rape" derives from the Latin word for turnip, rapa or rapum, cognate with the Greek word hrapys.

Rapeseed belongs to the Brassicaceae family of flowering plants. It has two subspecies, the Brassica napus ssp. napobrassica also known as the swedes rape and the brassica napus ssp. napus which includes the winter and spring oilseed, vegetable and fodder rape forms. The pabularia variety (Siberian kale) is a distinct leaf rape form of the napus subspecies which used to be common as a winter-annual vegetable.

Processing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal as a byproduct. The byproduct is a high-protein animal feed, competitive with soybean. The feed is employed mostly for cattle feeding, but is also used for pigs and poultry. However, natural rapeseed oil contains 50% erucic acid and high levels of glucosinolates that significantly lowers the nutritional value of rapeseed press cakes for animal feed.

Rapeseed oil is one of the oldest known vegetable oils, but historically was used in limited quantities due to high levels of erucic acid, which is damaging to cardiac muscle of animals, and glucosinolates, which made it less nutritious in animal feed. Rapeseed oil can contain up to 54% erucic acid. Food-grade canola oil derived from rapeseed cultivars, also known as rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil, has been generally recognized as safe by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Canola oil is limited by government regulation to a maximum of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA and 5% in the EU, with special regulations for infant food. These low levels of erucic acid are not believed to cause harm in human neonates.

Rapeseed is also used as a cover crop in the US during the winter as it prevents soil erosion, produces large amounts of biomass, suppresses weeds and can improve soil tilth with its root system. Some cultivars of rapeseed are also used as annual forage and are ready for grazing livestock 80 to 90 days after planting.

Rapeseed has a high melliferous potential and is a main forage crop for honeybees. Monofloral rapeseed honey has a whitish or milky yellow color, peppery taste and, due to its fast crystallization time, a soft-solid texture. It crystallizes within 3 to 4 weeks and can ferment over time if stored improperly. The low fructose-to-glucose ratio in monofloral rapeseed honey causes it to quickly granulate in the honeycomb, forcing beekeepers to extract the honey within 24 hours of it being capped." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed+]

Brassica rapa (Gilfeather turnip)
---------------------------------

*Overview*

"(85 days) Brassica napus x Brassica rapa Open-pollinated. This white-fleshed heirloom has put Wardsboro, Vt., (population 900) on the culinary map. Every October, Wardsboro hosts a festival at which Gilfeather is served in all the dishes. Although it has come down in folklore as a turnip, it is really an interspecies cross between a rutabaga and a true turnip, big-knobbed and bulky with small hairy tendrils growing on its light green skin. It was either developed or discovered by John Gilfeather (1865-1944) of Wardsboro in the late 1800s. He sold them by the cartload in Brattleboro, Vt., and Northhampton, Mass., in the early 1900s. Although Gilfeather is said to have cut the tops and bottoms off his turnips so no one else could propagate them, some seeds escaped to market growers William and Mary Lou Schmidt, who salvaged, multiplied and commercialized them.

Sweeter and later to mature than other turnips, not woody even at softball size, and taste better after frost. “Smooth, sweet, silky—we love it mashed with carrots and a small potato,” said Susan Lowry of Fryeburg, Maine. Amy Burke of York, Maine, suggested adding Gilfeather to our season-extending greens list. At the end of January she found them even hardier than Red Russian and Beedy’s Camden kales. Listed on Slow Food’s Ark of Taste. Cold-hardy through at least part of the Maine winter."  - https://www.fedcoseeds.com/seeds/search?item=2392[FedCo]

Camelina sativa (gold-of-pleasure, false flax, camelina)
--------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Camelina sativa is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae and is usually known in English as camelina, gold-of-pleasure, or false flax, also occasionally wild flax, linseed dodder, German sesame, and Siberian oilseed. It is native to Europe and to Central Asian areas. This plant is cultivated as oilseed crop mainly in Europe and in North America. 

As a summer or winter annual plant, camelina grows to heights of 30–120 cm (12–47 in), with branching stems which become woody at maturity. The leaves are alternate on the stem, lanceolate with a length from 2–8 cm (0.79–3.15 in) and a width of 2–10 mm (0.079–0.394 in). Leaves and stems may be partially hairy. It blooms in the UK, between June and July. Its abundant, four-petaled flowers are pale yellow in colour, and cross-shaped. Later, it produces a fruit which is pear shaped with a short beak. The seeds are brown, or orange in colour and a length of 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in). The 1,000-seed weight ranges from 0.8–2.0 g (0.028–0.071 oz).

Camelina sativa has been traditionally cultivated as an oilseed crop to produce vegetable oil and animal feed. Ample archeological evidence shows it has been grown in Europe for at least 3,000 years. The earliest findsites include the Neolithic levels at Auvernier, Switzerland (dated to the second millennium BC), the Chalcolithic level at Pefkakia in Greece (dated to the third millennium BC), and Sucidava-Celei, Romania (circa 2200 BC). During the Bronze age and Iron age, it was an important agricultural crop in northern Greece beyond the current range of the olive. It was also found in Denmark, and during the Stone Age in Hungary. It apparently continued to be grown at the time of the Roman Empire, although its Greek and Latin names are not known. As early as 600 BC, it was being sown as a monoculture around the Rhine River Valley, and was thought to have spread mainly by coexisting as a weed with flax monocultures.

Until the 1940s, camelina was an important oil crop in eastern and central Europe, and currently has continued to be cultivated in a few parts of Europe for its seed oil. Camelina oil was used in oil lamps (until the modern harnessing of natural gas, propane, and electricity) and as an edible oil (Camelina oil, also referred to as wild flax or false flax oil). It was possibly brought to North America unintentionally as a weed with flaxseed, and has had limited commercial importance until modern times. Currently, the breeding potential is unexplored compared to other oilseeds commercially grown around the world.

The edible seeds, can be sprinkled on salads or mixed with water to produce an egg substitute.

The crop is now being researched due to its exceptionally high level (up to 45%) of omega-3 fatty acids, which is uncommon in vegetable sources. Seeds contain 38 to 43% oil and 27 to 32% protein. Over 50% of the fatty acids in cold-pressed camelina oil are polyunsaturated. The oil is also very rich in natural antioxidants, such as tocopherols, making this highly stable oil very resistant to oxidation and rancidity. It has 1–3% erucic acid; recently, several low-erucic and zero-erucic Camelina Sativa varieties (with erucic acid content of less than 1%) have been introduced. The vitamin E content of camelina oil is approximately 110 mg/100 g. It is well suited for use as a cooking oil as it has an almond-like flavor and aroma.

Camelina is a short-season crop (85–100 days) and grows well in the temperate climate zone in light or medium soils. Camelina is generally seeded in spring from March to May, but can also be seeded in fall in mild climates.

Usually, camelina does not need any field interventions. However, perennial weeds may be difficult to control. Some specialized oilseed herbicides can be used on it. Also, camelina is highly resistant to black leg and Alternaria brassicae, but it can be susceptible to sclerotinia stem rot. No insect has been found to cause economic damage to camelina. Camelina needs little water or nitrogen to flourish; it can be grown on marginal agricultural lands. Fertilization requirements depend on soils, but are generally low. It may be used as a rotation crop for wheat and other cereals, to increase the health of the soil. Camelina can also show some allelopathic traits, and it can be grown in mixed crop with cereals or legumes." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelina_sativa[Wikipedia]

"Camelina is an under utilized alternative grain crop with very high potential. Also known as false flax and can be used similarly for oil production. We are not the biggest fans of vegetable oils but camelina just might be the perfect healthy replacement for the scourge of canola. Grown in Europe for at least 3,000 years, where it is used for cooking and as a base for salad dressing. In Poland there is a particular kind of camelina oil that is registered with the EU as a traditional specialty. Contains up to 45% Omega-3 fatty acids. Very high yields from spring plantings."

Chenopodium berlandieri (huazontli, pitseed goosefoot, lamb's quarters)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Chenopodium berlandieri, also known by the common names pitseed goosefoot, huauzontle, lamb's quarters, and lambsquarters is an annual herbaceous plant in the goosefoot family.

The species is widespread in North America, where its range extends from Canada south to Michoacán, Mexico. It is found in every U.S. state except Hawaii. The fast-growing, upright plant can reach heights of more than 3 m. It can be differentiated from most of the other members of its large genus by its honeycomb-pitted seeds, and further separated by its serrated, more or less evenly lobed lower leaves.

Although widely regarded as a weed, this species was once one of several plants cultivated by Native Americans in prehistoric North America as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. C. berlandieri was a domesticated pseudocereal crop, similar to the closely related quinoa C. quinoa. It continues to be cultivated in Mexico as a pseudocereal, as a leaf vegetable, and for its broccoli-like flowering shoots." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenopodium_berlandieri[Wikipedia]

It tends to grow upright at first, reaching heights of 10–150 cm (rarely to 3 m), but typically becomes recumbent after flowering (due to the weight of the foliage and seeds) unless supported by other plants. The leaves are alternate and can be varied in appearance. The first leaves, near the base of the plant, are toothed and roughly diamond-shaped, 3–7 cm long and 3–6 cm broad. The leaves on the upper part of the flowering stems are entire and lanceolate-rhomboid, 1–5 cm long and 0.4–2 cm broad; they are waxy-coated, unwettable and mealy in appearance, with a whitish coat on the underside. The small flowers are radially symmetrical and grow in small cymes on a dense branched inflorescence 10–40 cm long. The leaves and young shoots may be eaten as a leaf vegetable, either steamed in its entirety, or cooked like spinach, but should be eaten in moderation due to high levels of oxalic acid. Each plant produces tens of thousands of black seeds. These are high in protein, vitamin A, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Quinoa is a closely related species which is grown specifically for its seeds. It is also used as a medicinal plant in traditional African medicine."

"A variety of Aztec Spinach (unrelated to common spinach) popularly cultivated in Mexico. The seeds have somewhat thinner coats than other types. Leaves can be eaten raw or cooked much like spinach. The seeds also have uses in the making of baking flours. Very hardy, grows to about 3-4ft, and can be a gorgeous ornamental as well. Leaves turn red as they mature. Similar in appearance to Lamb's Quarters."

Cyperus esculentus (tiger nut, nut grass, chufa water grass, earth almond)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Cyperus esculentus (also called chufa sedge, nut grass, yellow nutsedge, tiger nut sedge, edible galingale, water grass or earth almond) is a crop of the sedge family widespread across much of the world. It is found in most of the Eastern Hemisphere, including Southern Europe, Africa and Madagascar, as well as the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.

Cyperus esculentus can be found wild, as a weed, or as a crop. Evidence exists for its cultivation in Egypt since the sixth millennium BC, and for several centuries in Southern Europe. In Spain, C. esculentus is cultivated for its edible tubers, called earth almonds or tiger nuts, for the preparation of horchata de chufa, a sweet, milk-like beverage. However, in most other countries, C. esculentus is considered a weed. It is often found in wet soils such as rice paddies and peanut farms as well as well irrigated lawns and golf courses during warm weather; hence the name water grass. 

Harvest usually occurs in November or December and the leaves are scorched during the harvest. With a combine harvester, the tiger nut is pulled out of the ground. Immediately after harvesting, the tiger nuts are washed with water in order to remove sand and small stones. The drying occurs usually in the sun and can take up to three months. The temperatures and humidity levels have to be monitored very carefully during this period. The tiger nuts have to be turned every day to ensure uniform drying. The drying process ensures a longer shelf life. This prevents rot or other bacterial infections, securing quality and high nutrition levels. Disadvantages in the drying process are shrinkage, skin wrinkles and hard nut texture.


Dried tubers sold at the market of Banfora, Burkina Faso.

The tubers are edible, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavour, compared to the more bitter-tasting tuber of the related Cyperus rotundus (purple nutsedge). They are quite hard and are generally soaked in water before they can be eaten, thus making them much softer and giving them a better texture. They are a popular snack in West Africa.

They have various uses, such as horchata, a nonalcoholic beverage of milky appearance derived from the tubers of the tiger nut plant mixed with sugar and water, and commonly consumed in Spain.

Flour of roasted tiger nut is sometimes added to biscuits and other bakery products as well as in making oil, soap, and starch extracts. It is also used for the production of nougat, jam, beer, and as a flavoring agent in ice cream and in the preparation of kunnu (a local beverage in Nigeria). Kunnu is a nonalcoholic beverage prepared mainly from cereals (such as millet or sorghum) by heating and mixing with spices (dandelion, alligator pepper, ginger, licorice) and sugar. To make up for the poor nutritional value of kunnu prepared from cereals, tiger nut was found to be a good substitute for cereal grains. Tiger nut oil can be used naturally with salads or for deep frying. It is considered to be a high quality oil. Tiger nut “milk” has been tried as an alternative source of milk in fermented products, such as yogurt production, and other fermented products common in some African countries and can thus be useful replacing milk in the diet of people intolerant to lactose to a certain extent." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperus_esculentus[Wikipedia]

Eryngium foetidum (culantro, Mexican coriander)
-----------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Eryngium foetidum is a tropical perennial herb in the family Apiaceae. Common names include culantro (/kuːˈlɑːntroʊ/ or /kuːˈlæntroʊ/), recao, shadow beni, Mexican coriander, bhandhania, long coriander, and ngò gai. It is native to Mexico, Central America, and South America, but is cultivated worldwide, sometimes being grown as an annual in temperate climates.

In the United States, the common name culantro sometimes causes confusion with cilantro, a common name for the leaves of Coriandrum sativum (also in Apiaceae), of which culantro is said to taste like a stronger version. 

Eryngium foetidum is widely used in seasoning, marinating and garnishing in the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, Guyana, Suriname, and in Peru's Amazon regions. It is used extensively in Cambodia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Laos, and other parts of Asia as a culinary herb. It dries well, retaining good color and flavor, making it valuable in the dried herb industry. It is sometimes used as a substitute for coriander, but it has a much stronger taste." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryngium_foetidum[Wikipedia]

"Also known as Mexican coriander, thorny coriander, spiny coriander, fitweed, saw-leaf or saw-tooth herb, recao and Tabasco parsley, this herb has a similar flavor to cilantro although much stronger. Each leaf grows from the plant base, rather than a stem, and the leaves are harvested by cutting the entire rosette at the base before the plant begins to flower. In mild climates, the plant can be considered a short-lived perennial, but more often it is grown as an annual."

Foeniculum vulgare (wild fennel)
--------------------------------

*Overview*

"An erect perennial herb, four to nine feet tall, with feathery leaves and a strong anise scent. Small yellow flowers, clustered in large umbrella-like groups (compound umbels) four inches across, are conspicuous from April through July. During growing season, plants include both living and dead hollow stems, or canes. Seeds of wild fennel, oblong and ribbed, should look like those in the spice jar at home—the wild plant is the source of the seed used to flavor food. The most dangerous plant you might confuse fennel with is poison hemlock, which tends to grow near water or in moist soil, is tall (about three to six feet), has purple blotches on the main stem, and is heavily branched with small umbels of white flowers. To distinguish between it and fennel, crush some leaves and smell them––but not with your bare hands: poison hemlock contains coniine, a toxin that can be absorbed through the skin. Poison hemlock smells mousy or musty.

Fennel, also known as anise, sweet fennel, and aniseed, is native to the shores of the Mediterranean, where it has been used for centuries as a spice and an herbal medicine. In the footsteps of man and his animals, it has spread around the world and is now widely naturalized along roadsides and in pastures and other open sites, especially on dry soils near coasts and on riverbanks. In Australia and the United States, it is considered an invasive species and a weed. Although details of its introduction are unknown, on the East Coast, it likely arrived with the first European settlers. On the West Coast it has been in California for at least 120 years, where it is presumed to have escaped from cultivation repeatedly.

Fennel seems designed to invade. It reproduces from seed and root crown, developing dense, uniform stands up to seven feet tall. It is particularly aggressive in areas that are plowed or grazed and then abandoned, or what field guides call “disturbed areas,” those sites where many invaders can all too often be found, busy outcompeting the natives for light, nutrients, and water, and perhaps exuding allelopathic substances that inhibit the growth of other plants. Fennel seeds are dispersed by wind and water; birds and rodents; and mud on vehicles, shoes, and clothing. Livestock in pastures where fennel is producing seed will spread it to new sites. Most of the heavily infested areas of Santa Cruz Island, California, were formerly cattle pastures. Because of fennel’s prolific seed production from May to November and its seed viability of several years, long-lived seedbanks can build up rapidly. Its thick taproot makes eradication difficult." - http://eattheinvaders.org/blue-plate-special-wild-fennel/[Eat the Invaders]

"This variety is grown for its leaves, pollen, and seeds; it does not make bulbs. Wild fennel fronds are used for flavoring fish and soups. Pollen from the pretty yellow flowers is considered a delicacy and is used for its intense flavor. Seeds, which are produced abundantly, have a strong fragrance and clean flavor; they are often used in making fennel sausage. Beautiful yellow flowers are suitable for cutting. 30-40 inches high. 75 days. 4 grams = approximately 1200 seeds."

Hablitzia tamnoides (causasian mountain spinach)
------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Hablitzia Tamnoides is a semi shade loving perennial climber with mild edible spinach type leaves. Originating in the Caucasus region, it has been grown in Scandinavian countries as an ornamental before making a bit of a renaissance recently by author and plant expert Stephen Barstow. Now permaculturists and forest gardeners as well as those interested in perennial vegetables are beginning to give it a try as another possible staple that can happily grow in any garden with a shady spot. The young shoots can be eaten in early spring as well as pickings from the more mature leaves over the summer. Hablitzia seeds need a period of cold to germinate. Sow outside in a cold frame over the winter or sow in spring and place in the fridge for 10 days to trigger germination.

Start off with seed – you can sow in pots from October through to January and leave outside in a cold frame and the seeds will germinate naturally over a number of weeks. Alternatively for a spring sowing, seeds need to be stratified for a period of 7-10 days in a fridge ( sow in damp compost or vermiculite and place in a plastic bag). Sow the seeds at a depth of 1-2mm. This period of cold followed by removal from the fridge helps to trigger germination.

Seedlings can then be handled and potted on ready to be planted out when big enough. The plants need something to scramble up and can reach 7-10 ft tall. In the autumn they produce very decorative green/white flowers which eventually turn into tiny black seeds. The foliage dies back and over the winter a crown of baby shoots that produce the next years growth will emerge. Once the plants are mature you can crop the early shoots and then leave the rest to start growing and climbing and harvest leaves throughout spring and summer. You can collect an awful lot of seed from mature plants and also divide up the roots if you are careful. It is a good idea to plant two or more plants close to each other to ensure the plants produce viable seed. Slow in the first year, they really go for it in the second and third." - https://www.incrediblevegetables.co.uk/hablitzia-tamnoides-how-to-grow/[Mandy Barber]

"Hablitzia tamnoides Open-pollinated perennial, Zones 3-6. The surprise sensation of our 2015 catalog, Hablitzia’s success motivated us to Ramp up our perennial vegetable selection. Too new to have an agreed-upon common name, this plant has everything else. Originating in the Caucasus Mountains, it is a very hardy perennial, growing 6–9' long for 2–3 months in the very early spring when few other edible greens have surfaced. It’s also tasty: both early shoots and subsequent leaves make a delicious and tender spinach-like vegetable without any bitterness. Moreover, it’s beautiful, and was introduced into Sweden around 1870 as an attractive vine to screen houses with its heart-shaped leaves. And, finally, though it is best grown in sun to maximize its productivity, it will also do well in its native habitat, the understory of temperate forests. Best germinated with stratification, and slow-growing in the first year."

Hovenia dulcis (Japanese raisin tree)
-------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Hovenia dulcis, the Japanese raisin tree or oriental raisin tree, is a hardy tree found from Asia, over Eastern China (萬壽果) and Korea (헛개나무) to the Himalayas (up to altitudes of 2,000 m), growing preferably in a sunny position on moist sandy or loamy soils. The tree known for its health benefits when consumed in tea, introduced as an ornamental tree to several countries, also bears edible fruit. It is considered to be one of the most pervasive invader in Brazilian subtropical forests.

Tree, rarely a shrub, deciduous, to 10–30 m tall. Branchlets brown or black-purple, glabrous, with inconspicuous lenticels. The glossy leaves are large and pointed. The trees bear clusters of small cream-coloured hermaphroditic flowers in July. The drupes appear at the ends of edible fleshy fruit stalks (rachis), which is a type of accessory fruit. 

The fleshy rachis of the infructescence is sweet, fragrant and is edible raw or cooked. Dried, they look and taste like raisins. An extract of the seeds, bough and young leaves can be used as a substitute for honey and is used for making wine and candy.

An extract of the leaves contains hodulcine, a glycoside which exhibits an anti-sweet activity.

The timber is fine and hard and is used for building construction and fine furniture.

It has been used in traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese medicines to treat fever, parasitic infection, as a laxative, and a treatment of liver diseases, and as a hangover treatment.

In Thailand Hovenia dulcis is relatively rare, typically found in the stream-irrigated valleys of primary lower mountain evergreen forest located between 1,075 and 1,250 metres above sea level. However, it is one of 30 potential species identified as a substitute for Eucalyptus spp., commonly planted for reforestation, that would meet the demand for rapid growth while not disturbing the ecological balance.

In Thailand Hovenia dulcis grows at roughly the same rate as eucalyptus, reaching six metres in height within three years. One major asset is that the growth form of the tree allows other species to regenerate nearby. As well, the tree attracts several varieties of both birds and mammals which feed on the seeds and fruit. As well as promoting fauna diversity, this process assists in improving soil fertility through humification." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovenia_dulcis[Wikipedia]

Lablab purpureus (hyacinth bean)
--------------------------------

*Overview*

"Lablab purpureus is a species of bean in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Africa and it is cultivated throughout the tropics for food. English language common names include hyacinth bean, lablab-bean bonavist bean/pea, dolichos bean, seim bean, lablab bean, Egyptian kidney bean, Indian bean, bataw and Australian pea. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Lablab.

The plant is variable due to extensive breeding in cultivation, but in general, they are annual or short-lived perennial vines. The wild species is perennial. The thick stems can reach six meters in length. The leaves are made up of three pointed leaflets each up to 15 centimeters long. They may be hairy on the undersides. The inflorescence is made up of racemes of many flowers. Some cultivars have white flowers, and others may have purplish or blue. The fruit is a legume pod variable in shape, size, and color. It is usually several centimeters long and bright purple to pale green. It contains up to four seeds. The seeds are white, brown, red, or black depending on the cultivar, sometimes with a white hilum. Wild plants have mottled seeds. The seed is about a centimeter long.

The hyacinth bean is an old domesticated pulse and multi-purpose crop. Due to seed availability of one forage cultivar (cv. Rongai), it is often grown as forage for livestock and as an ornamental plant. In addition, it is cited both as a medicinal plant and a poisonous plant.

The fruit and beans are edible if boiled well with several changes of the water. Otherwise, they are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides, glycosides that are converted to hydrogen cyanide when consumed. Signs of poisoning include weakness, vomiting, dyspnea, twitching, stupor, and convulsions. It has been shown that there is a wide range of cyanogenic potential among the varieties.

The leaves are eaten raw or cooked like spinach. The flowers can be eaten raw or steamed. The root can be boiled or baked for food. The seeds are used to make tofu and tempeh." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lablab[Wikipedia]

Lactuca sativa (celtuce)
------------------------

"Celtuce goes by many different names including Stem Lettuce, Chinese Lettuce, and Asparagus Lettuce. Celtuce (Lactuca sativa var. augustana, angustata, or asparagine) is the most unique of the five lettuce varieties. Originating in the Mediterranean, like most lettuces, it then arrived in China around 600 A.D., making its way to the western world in the 19th century. 
What makes Celtuce so unique is that, unlike the other lettuces we covered previously, it can be consumed after it has bolted with no effect on flavor. Plus, it doesn’t look like your typical lettuces, but instead more like a cross between lettuce and celery. And yes, both the stem and leaves can be eaten. The stem, or core, can be eaten raw, however cooking it brings out more of its nutty (sometimes almost smoky) flavor, and it retains its crisp texture. Some insist the leaves are bitter, but I find they can highlight a cooked dish quite well, and few of them can brighten any garden salad. Plus, I enjoy the zero waste notion when using the whole plant. 

The planting of celtuce is indeed like that of other lettuces and most other cool weather crops and needs to be done in early spring or in late summer to early fall for a later fall crop. It’s best to sow seeds in partial shade about ¼ inch deep and thin to 2” apart. Plants can also be thinned later to about 10” apart once the celtuce has grown large enough to be used as leaf lettuce. The thinned plants can be transplanted to elsewhere in your garden. 

As with any lettuce, giving it enough water is critical to allow for proper growth and to prevent disease. When watering, do so with consistent, light waterings that keep the soil moist down to about 1 foot, but don’t allow it to become waterlogged. It’s best to water your plants using drip irrigation and not overhead watering. Allowing your celtuce to keep its leaves dry and feet consistently moist (but not drowning), along with proper ventilation, can help ward off tip burn, rots, mildews, and even insect infestations. Also keeping your garden neat and tidy and planting flowers, such as marigolds, to reduce pests, can help keep your celtuce and the rest of your garden healthy and happy.

When the growing season ends there is no harm in letting your celtuce flower. Doing so will allow it to drop seeds that can become next season’s celtuce crop. However, rotation can help reduce disease and pest problems. So do what is best for your garden and keep your celtuce in tiptop shape. 

As you go to harvest celtuce be aware that the larger you allow the stems to grow, the more likely they will be bitter and woody. It’s best to harvest stems at no larger than 1” in diameter. The leaves can be picked at any time, but those in the earlier part of the growing season tend to be less bitter. Once you remove the leaves from the stems, store them separately in the refrigerator, and away from any apples, pears or bananas. These fruits release ethylene gas, which is a natural ripening agent and will lead to a much quicker deterioration of your celtuce, or any lettuce." - https://permaculturenews.org/2017/08/24/celtuce-stem-lettuce/[Bobbi Luttjohann]

Lepidium meyenii (Maca 'red')
-----------------------------

*Overview*

"Lepidium meyenii, known as maca or Peruvian ginseng, is an edible herbaceous biennial plant of the family Brassicaceae that is native to South America in the high Andes mountains of Peru. It was found exclusively at the Meseta de Bombón plateau close to Lake Junin in the late 1980s. It is grown for its fleshy hypocotyl that is fused with a taproot, which is typically dried, but may also be freshly cooked as a root vegetable. If it is dried, it may be further processed into a flour for baking or as a dietary supplement. It also has uses in traditional medicine. As a cash crop, it is primarily exported as a powder that may be raw, or processed further by the supplement industry: gelatinized or made into an extract. 

Its Spanish and Quechua names include maca-maca, maino, ayak chichira, and ayak willku. 

The growth habit, size, and proportions of maca are roughly similar to those of radishes and turnips, to which it is related, but it also resembles a parsnip. The green, fragrant tops are short and lie along the ground. The thin, frilly leaves sprout in a rosette at the soil surface, not growing more than 12–20 cm (4.7–7.9 in) in height. The leaves show a dimorphism according to reproductive stage. They are more prominent in the vegetative phase, and are continuously renewed from the center as the outer leaves die. The off-white, self-fertile flowers are borne on a central raceme, and are followed by 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) siliculate fruits, each containing two small 2.0–2.5 mm (0.079–0.098 in) reddish-gray ovoid seeds. Seeds are the maca’s only means of reproduction. Maca reproduces mainly through self-pollination and is an autogamous species. The genome consists of 64 chromosomes. From experiments with different day lengths, maca is a short-day plant. Some sources consider the maca to be an annual plant, as in favorable years it can complete a lifecycle within a year.

The natural environment of the maca is at 11-12ºS latitude and at an elevation of 3,800–4,400 m (12,500–14,400 ft) above sea level. At this elevation, temperatures of the growing season vary from −2 to 13 °C (28 to 55 °F) in monthly mean minimum or maximum, respectively. Temperatures can decline, however, as low as −10 °C (14 °F) and frosts are common. Of the cultivated plants, maca is one of the most frost tolerant. Strong winds and sunlight also are characteristics of the native habitat of the maca. Maca today is still mainly cultivated in Peru, in the high Andes of Bolivia, and to a small extent also in Brazil. Maca can be cultivated beyond its natural elevation range, over 4,400 m (14,400 ft) above sea level.

Maca (Peruvian ginseng) seedlings usually emerge about one month after sowing with the onset of the rainy season in October. In the vegetative phase, until May to June, the lower part of the hypocotyl, as well as the upper part of the tap root, grows in size. After 260 to 280 days, it is formed to the harvestable hypocotyl. If the root is left in the soil, it is dormant for two to three months in the time of the cold, dry season until August. Then it will form a generative shoot on which the seeds ripen five months later. One plant is capable of forming up to 1000 tiny seeds, 1600 of which weigh about one gram. Thus, only relatively few plants are needed for propagation. The plants for cultivation are selected for preferred size and color, then placed 50–100 mm deep in pits with alternate layers of grass and soil to protect them from drying out. They are fertilized heavily, as maca is a soil exhaustive crop. The cultivation cycle is strictly linked to seasonality.

As maca grows on sites where no other crops can be cultivated, it is often found after long fallows of sheep grazing pastures. Maca croplands thus traditionally are only fertilized with sheep and alpaca manure; however, fertilizer application could prevent soils from depleting in nutrients.

Maca is mainly grown for consumption of its root. The majority of harvested maca is dried. In this form, the hypocotyls can be stored for several years. In Peru, maca is prepared and consumed in various ways, although traditionally it is always cooked. The freshly harvested hypocotyl may be roasted in a pit (called huatia), and is considered a delicacy. Fresh roots usually are available only in the vicinity of the growers. The root can also be mashed and boiled to produce a sweet, thick liquid, then dried and mixed with milk to form a porridge, mazamorra. The cooked roots are also used with other vegetables in empanadas, jams, or soups. The root may be ground to produce a flour for bread, cakes, or pancakes. If fermented, a weak beer called chicha de maca may be produced. In 2010, a U.S.-based brewery called Andean Brewing Company, became the first company to produce and commercialize beer made from maca under the brand KUKA Beer.] From the black morphotype, a liquor is produced. Also, the leaves are edible or may serve as animal fodder. They can be prepared raw in salads or cooked much like Lepidium sativum and L. campestre, to which it is closely related genetically.

The prominent product for export is maca flour, which is a baking flour ground from the hard, dried roots. It is called harina de maca. Maca flour (powder) is a relatively inexpensive bulk commodity, much like wheat flour or potato flour. The supplement industry uses both the dry roots and maca flour for different types of processing and concentrated extracts. Another common form is maca processed by gelatinization. This extrusion process separates and removes the tough fiber from the roots using gentle heat and pressure, as raw maca is difficult to digest due to its thick fibers and goitrogen content.

There is archaeological evidence for varying degrees of cultivation of maca in the Lake Junin region from around 1700 BC to 1200 AD. Maca has been harvested and used by humans in the puna grasslands of the Andean Mountains for centuries. Contrary to frequent claims that maca's cultivation was common in what is today Peru, until the late 1980s, maca has been cultivated only in a limited area around Lake Junin, in central Peru. Historically, maca often was traded for lowland tropical food staples, such as corn, rice, manioc (tapioca roots), quinoa, and papaya. It also was used as a form of payment of Spanish imperial taxes." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidium_meyenii[Wikipedia]

Lupinus mutabilis (tarwi, chocho, Andean lupin)
-----------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Lupinus mutabilis is a species of lupin grown in the Andes, mainly for its edible bean. Vernacular names include tarwi (tarhui), chocho, altramuz, Andean lupin, South American lupin, Peruvian field lupin, and pearl lupin. Its nutrient-rich seeds are high in protein, as well as a good source for cooking oil. However, their bitter taste has made L. mutabilis relatively unknown outside the Andes, though modern technology makes it easier to remove the bitter alkaloids.

The origin of L. mutabilis has been identified in the Andean region of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. In this area, the greatest genetic variability in the world was found. The plant has been domesticated for more than 1500 years, mostly because of its high protein content.

The bone-white seed contains more than 40% protein and 20% fat and has been used as a food by Andean people since ancient times, especially in soups, stews, salads and by itself mixed with boiled maize. Like other legumes, its protein is rich in the essential amino acid lysine. The distribution of essential fatty acids is about 28% linoleic acid (omega-6) and 2% linolenic acid (omega-3). It has a soft seed coat that makes for easy cooking. It may not have been more widely used because of its bitter taste, due to the alkaloid content. It contains unusually high amounts of sparteine, which make up nearly half of its alkaloid content. However, the alkaloids are water-soluble and can be removed by soaking the seeds for some days in water. It is also possible to remove the alkaloids by denaturation with heat treatment.

Lupinus mutabilis is a crop for cool climates and exists mainly in valleys at high altitudes, such as the Andes at tropical latitudes. The crop can be grown at an altitude that ranges from 800 to 3000 m. The crop withstands exceptional levels of drought. Mature plants are resistant to frost, whereas seedlings are sensitive to low temperatures." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus_mutabilis[Wikipedia]

*****
"(130 days, longer to seed) Open-pollinated. We thank Gary Kaszas of Fort Fairfield, Maine, for providing us with the impetus to offer Tarwi, one of the “lost” crops of the Incas. Years ago he sent us seeds he had accessed from the USDA seed bank for this wild-looking 3' lupine native to the high Andes. In our trials, we were first attracted to its flowers, mostly mountain-sky blue with yellows, reds and whites interspersed. More than just a beautiful ornamental plant, Tarwi is potentially an important food crop. With a full range of essential amino acids and more than 40% protein, its luminous pearly-white bean-like seeds (2–6 per pod) surpass soybeans nutritionally. They require a long season to mature, and must be soaked and rinsed repeatedly to leach out their bitter alkaloids to make a palatable food, somewhat akin to barley in texture and taste. Start the seed indoors—the young plants are frost sensitive. Even if you lack the climate or the dedication to grow the plants to seed, all is not lost. These leguminous beauties grow in poor soil, fixing nitrogen and attracting beneficial insects with honey-scented flowers. Especially attractive to pollinators."

Mespilus germanica (medlar)
---------------------------

*Overview*

"Mespilus germanica, known as the medlar or common medlar, is a large shrub or small tree, and the name of the fruit of this tree. The fruit has been cultivated since Roman times, and is unusual in being available in winter, and in being eaten when bletted. It is eaten raw and in a range of dishes. When the genus Mespilus is included in the genus Crataegus, the correct name for this species is Crataegus germanica (Kuntze). 

Despite its Latin name, which means German or Germanic medlar, it is indigenous to Persia (Iran), southwest Asia and also southeastern Europe, especially the Black Sea coasts of Bulgaria and of modern Turkey. It may have been cultivated for as long as 3,000 years. The ancient Greek geographer Strabo refers to a μέσπιλον (mespilon) in Geographica, book 16, Chapter 4.

Until recently, Mespilus germanica was the only known species of medlar. However, in 1990, a new species was discovered in North America, now named Mespilus canescens. The loquat, Eriobotrya japonica, is more distantly related than genera such as Crataegus, Amelanchier, Peraphyllum, and Malacomeles, but was once thought to be closely related, and is still sometimes called the 'Japanese medlar'. 

Mespilus germanica requires warm summers and mild winters and prefers sunny, dry locations and slightly acidic soil. Under ideal circumstances, the deciduous plant grows up to 8 metres (26 ft) tall. Generally, it is shorter and more shrub-like than tree-like. With a lifespan of 30–50 years, the medlar tree is rather short-lived. Its bark is greyish brown with deep vertical cracks forming rectangular plates that tend to lift off. The leaves are dark green and elliptic, 8–15 centimetres (3.1–5.9 in) long and 3–5 centimetres (1.2–2.0 in) wide. The leaves are densely hairy (pubescent) below, and turn red in autumn before falling. It is found across Southern Europe where it is generally rare. It is reported to be naturalized in some woods in Southeast England, but is found in few gardens.

The flowers have five broadly ovate white petals. The flowers appear in late spring, are hermaphrodite, pollinated by bees, and self-fertile. The flower is 6 centimetres (2.4 in) wide. The reddish-brown fruit is a pome, 2–3 centimetres (0.79–1.18 in) diameter, with wide-spreading persistent sepals around a central pit, giving a 'hollow' appearance to the fruit.

The medlar was introduced to Greece around 700 BC, and to Rome about 200 BC. It was an important fruit plant during Roman and medieval times. By the 17th and 18th centuries, however, it had been superseded by other fruits, and is little cultivated today. M. germanica pomes are one of the few fruits that become edible in winter, making it an important tree for gardeners who wish to have fruit available all year round. M. germanica plants can be grafted on to the rootstock of another species, for example the pear, quince, or hawthorn, to improve their performance in different soils.

Mespilus germanica fruits are hard and acidic, but become edible after being softened, 'bletted', by frost, or naturally in storage given sufficient time. Once softening begins, the skin rapidly takes on a wrinkled texture and turns dark brown, and the inside reduces to the consistency and flavour reminiscent of apple sauce. This process can confuse those new to medlars, as a softened fruit looks as if it has spoiled.

Once bletted, the fruit can be eaten raw and is often eaten as a dessert, or used to make medlar jelly. They are used in "Medlar cheese", which is similar to lemon curd, being made with the fruit pulp, eggs, and butter. So-called medlar tea is usually not made from M. germanica but from wolfberry or goji, which is sometimes called "red medlar".

Cultivars of Mespilus germanica that are grown for their fruit include 'Hollandia', 'Nottingham', and 'Russian', the large-fruited variety 'Dutch' (also known as 'Giant' or 'Monstrous'), 'Royal', 'Breda giant', and 'Large Russian'. The cultivar 'Nottingham' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mespilus_germanica[Wikipedia]

Perilla frutescens (perilla, shiso)
-----------------------------------

*Overview*

"Perilla is a genus consisting of one major Asiatic crop species Perilla frutescens and a few wild species in nature belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. The genus encompasses several distinct varieties of Asian herb, seed, and vegetable crop, including P. frutescens (deulkkae) and P. frutescens var. crispa (shiso). The genus name Perilla is also a frequently employed common name ("perilla"), applicable to all varieties. Perilla varieties are cross-fertile and intra-specific hybridization occurs naturally. Some varieties are considered invasive.

Perilla varieties are cultivated and consumed mainly in Korea, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. P. frutescens leaves, seeds, and seed oil are used extensively in Korean cuisine, while P. frutescens var. crispa leaves, seeds, and sprouts are used in Japanese and Vietnamese cuisines.

Perilla is one of the 50 fundamental herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is called Zi Su (紫苏), and is used to disperse wind-cold, bloating, and stomach and lung problems. It is sometimes paired with Tu Huo Xiang or Guang Huo Xiang to dispel dampness and tonify qi." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilla[Wikipedia]

*****
"Shiso ‘Aoshiso’ is the typical green leaf variety of Perilla used extensively in Japan and all over Asia to season vegetables, rice, soups, fish, etc. The leaves make for exquisite decoration. It is finely sliced with ginger and added to salads, sautéed vegetables, sashimi, tempura and sushi.
Shiso, equally well known as Perilla has a wonderful complex aroma. The taste is almost always said to be quite hard to describe; the words cinnamon, basil, anise, and citrus pop up in the attempts.

The regular Perilla is usually available with either red or green leaves, the red having more of an anise flavour and slightly less spicy than the green variety, which tastes more like cinnamon.
A less typical form of Perilla has beautiful bi-coloured leaves. Sometimes referred to as Perilla 'Britton' and called ‘Hojiso’ in Japan, the red-veined leaves are green on top and deep purple-red on the bottom.

Occasionally referred to as Japanese Basil, it is useful as a flavourful herb in a variety of European dishes. Its flavour and fragrance go well with egg, fish and meat.
Shiso can be grown just to baby leaf stage or left to grow to maturity: the taste is best appreciated raw in salads and sandwiches. This savory herb can be used in place of basil, even as a pizza topping. Wrap around rice balls, cheese or salmon. Chop and mix with ginger root in stir-fries or sprinkle over a hot steak. It is great for sauces and can be used dried to flavour rice.

It is worth noting that Perilla is a very attractive plant often grown simply for its ornamental value. Both green and red varieties resemble a coleus plant. This attractive herb is an excellent addition to an herb garden or can be used as an ornamental in containers or in the border. It has a pleasant odour and is easy to grow. The flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies and the foliage will last all through summer and into autumn."

Physalis peruviana (Cape gooseberry, ground cherry)
---------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Physalis peruviana, a plant species of the genus Physalis in the nightshade family Solanaceae, has its origin in Peru. The plant and its fruit are commonly called Cape gooseberry, goldenberry, poha, and physalis, among numerous regional names. It has been cultivated in England since the late 18th century, and in South Africa in the Cape of Good Hope since at least the start of the 19th century. Widely introduced in the 20th century, P. peruviana is cultivated or grows wild across the world in temperate and tropical regions.

It is an economically useful crop as an exotic exported fruit, and is favored in breeding and cultivation programs in many countries. 

It is closely related to the tomatillo and to the Chinese lantern, also members of the genus Physalis. As a member of the plant family Solanaceae, it is more distantly related to a large number of edible plants, including tomato, eggplant, potato, and other members of the nightshades. Despite its name, it is not botanically related to gooseberries such as the Ribes gooseberry, Indian gooseberry, or Chinese gooseberry.

It is an annual in temperate locations, but perennial in the tropics. As a perennial, it develops into a diffusely branched shrub reaching 1–1.6 m (3.3–5.2 ft) in height, with spreading branches and velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The hermaphrodite flowers are bell-shaped and drooping, 15–20 mm (0.59–0.79 in) across, yellow with purple-brown spots internally. After the flower falls, the calyx expands, ultimately forming a beige husk fully enclosing the fruit.

The fruit is a round, smooth berry, resembling a miniature yellow tomato 1.25–2 cm (0.49–0.79 in) wide. Removed from its calyx, it is bright yellow to orange in color, and sweet when ripe, with a characteristic, mildly tart tomato flavor. 

n the wild, Cape gooseberry grows in forests, forest margins, riparian and uncultivated locations. In South America, it grows at high elevations of 500–3,000 m (1,600–9,800 ft), but may also be at sea level in Oceania and Pacific islands where it occurs widely in subtropical and warm, temperate conditions. Its latitude range is about 45 to 60, and its altitude range is generally from sea level to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). P. peruviana thrives at an annual average temperature from 13–18 °C (55–64 °F), tolerating temperatures as high as 30 °C (86 °F). It grows well in Mediterranean climates and is hardy to USDA hardiness zone 8, meaning it can be damaged by frost. It grows well in rainfall amounts from 800–4,300 mm (31–169 in) if the soil is well drained, and prefers full sun or partial shade in well-drained soil, and grows vigorously in sandy loam. The plant has become invasive in some natural habitats, forming thickets, particularly in Hawaii and on other Pacific islands.

The plant is readily grown from seeds, which are abundant (100 to 300 in each fruit), but with low germination rates, requiring thousands of seeds to sow a hectare. Year-old stem cuttings treated with hormones to promote rooting are successful for planting, but have a lower rate of success than growing from seed.

Physalis peruviana is an economically useful crop as an exotic exported fruit, and is favored in breeding and cultivation programs of many countries. P. peruviana fruits are marketed in the United States as goldenberry and sometimes Pichuberry, named after Machu Picchu in order to associate the fruit with its origin in Peru.

Cape gooseberry is made into fruit-based sauces, pies, puddings, chutneys, jams, and ice cream, or eaten fresh in salads and fruit salads.[2] Because of the fruit's decorative appearance in its showy husk, it is popular in restaurants as an exotic garnish for desserts. To enhance its food uses, hot air drying improved qualities of dietary fiber content, texture, and appearance." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis_peruviana[Wikipedia]

*****
"Physalis is a genus of plants that are native to warm temperate and subtropical regions throughout the world. They are herbaceous plants which are a relative of and similar to the common tomato.
The genus is characterised by the small orange fruit similar in size, shape and structure to a small tomato. The plant conveniently wraps up each fruit in its own 'paper bag' (botanically, the calyx) to protect it from pests and the elements.

The fruit of Physalis peruviana is similar in texture to a firm tomato; the flavour is a unique pineapple-like blend with a mild refreshing fruity acidity, similar to strawberries. They may be eaten raw or used in salads, desserts and in jams and jellies. They go nicely with meats and other savory foods and can be dried and eaten much like figs, apricots or grapes. As a special treat try dipping the fruit in melted chocolate!
Fantastic, fragrant and exotic, they also make a lovely still life in a glass bowl for the middle of any table.

The Cape Gooseberry is a useful small crop for the home garden. The fruit is expensive to purchase as it is labour intensive in commercial plantings.
Very easy to grow from seed, being very similar to tomatoes, it is not cold-hardy (to minus 3°C / 26°F) though it can overwinter outdoors in mild areas or when grown in favoured positions such as the foot of a sunny wall, where some will tolerate temperatures down to about -10°C (14°F)."

Plantago coronopus (erba stella or minutina)
--------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Plantago coronopus produces a basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves up to 25 centimeters long that are toothed or deeply divided. The inflorescences grow erect to about 4 to 7 cm in height. They have dense spikes of flowers which sometimes curve. Each flower has four whitish lobes each measuring about a millimeter long. Plantago coronopus mainly grows on sandy or gravelly soils close to the sea. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa but it can be found elsewhere, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand as an introduced species.

It is grown as a leaf vegetable known as erba stella,[3] mostly incorporated in salad mixes for specialty markets. Recently it has become popular as a frost-hardy winter crop for farmers in northern climates, and is usually grown in unheated hightunnels." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantago_coronopus[Wikipedia]

"Minutina, also known as Erba Stella is a unique, cold weather salad green prized in Italy for its mild nutty flavour and crunchy texture. Resembling a narrow mizuna it develops into a small plant with a delicate rosette of slender green leaves. The narrow leaves have little “horns” along the edges.

Like miner’s lettuce, corn salad, wild rocket and mizuna, Minutina, is very hardy and will stand all winter in an unheated greenhouse. Often planted for winter salads it can tolerate moderate frosts and be grown all winter in temperate climates.
Incredibly easy to grow, sow in rows in the garden or in containers and harvest after just seven weeks at approx 15cm (6in) high. The leaves are at their most delicious when they are in the young and succulent phase. A perennial plant, once harvested new growth often follows again.

Minutina is a great addition to salad mixes for variety in leaf shape and texture, it can be used in oriental dishes and stir fried in or can simply be pan fried with the most basic ingredients. Use as an edible bed for seafood, cooked vegetables and meat medallions, it is an ideal garnish for main entrées and perfect for savory creations."

"The name translates from Italian to “star grass”, an apt description of this lovely plant. Native to Europe’s rocky coastline, it is a seaside plant that thrives in cool wet weather (sound familiar?) and even saline soils. It is a survivor to the extreme and really, no offense to your gardening enthusiasm, it needs nothing from you. It’s a delightful little green with long, slender, antler like leaves, a succulent quality and a satisfying crunch. The flavor is mild, tending towards nutty which, along with its unique appearance, makes it an unusual and distinctive addition to salads. We are salad green nerds here at Uprising and this was another exciting success in our quest for winter/spring hardy greens for the PNW garden. Best quality before flowering. AKA “Minutina” and “Buckshorn Plantain”.

Salsola soda (agretti)
----------------------

*Overview*

"Salsola soda, more commonly known in English as opposite-leaved saltwort, oppositeleaf Russian thistle, or barilla plant, is a small (to 0.7 m tall), annual, succulent shrub that is native to the Mediterranean Basin. It is a halophyte (a salt-tolerant plant) that typically grows in coastal regions and can be irrigated with salt water.

The plant has great historical importance as a source of soda ash, which was extracted from the ashes of Salsola soda and other saltwort plants. Soda ash is one of the alkali substances that are crucial in glassmaking and soapmaking. The famed clarity of 16th century cristallo glass from Murano and Venice depended upon the purity of "Levantine soda ash," and the nature of this ingredient was kept secret. Spain had an enormous 18th century industry that produced soda ash from the saltworts (barrilla in Spanish). Soda ash is now known to be predominantly sodium carbonate. In 1807, Sir Humphry Davy isolated a metallic element from caustic soda; he named the new element "sodium" to indicate its relationship to "soda." Before soda was somewhat synonymous (in U.S. English) with soft drinks, the word referred to Salsola soda and other saltwort plants, and to "sodas" derived from soda ash.

While the era of farming for soda ash is long past, S. soda is still cultivated as a vegetable that enjoys considerable popularity in Italy and with gourmets around the world. Its common names in Italian include barba di frate, agretti, and liscari sativa (short: lischi or lischeri). Of its culinary value, Frances Mayes has written that "Spinach is the closest taste, but while agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy of spring."

This annual, succulent plant can grow into small shrubs up to 0.7 m tall (sometimes called subshrubs). It has fleshy green leaves with either green or red stems. The tiny flowers develop from inflorescences that grow out of the base of the leaves near the stem.

The Italian name agretti is commonly used in English to refer to the edible leaves of S. soda; barba di frate (or friar's beard) is the most common of the Italian names. This plant is not a summer green and should be started early indoors or in autumn. The seed is notorious for poor germination at about 30 to 40% standard, much like rosemary. Though the plant is often grown in saltwater-irrigated land in the Mediterranean Basin, it will grow without salt water. S. soda is harvested in bunches when small, or cropped regularly to encourage new growth when mature. It is most commonly boiled and eaten as a leafy vegetable; the recommendation is to cook it in boiling water until the leaves soften, and to serve while some bite (crunch) remains (much like samphire). It can also be eaten raw; it is said to "taste grassy and slightly salty with a pleasant, crunchy texture."

Salsola soda is sometimes confused with a plant known in Japan as okahijiki (land seaweed), which is actually the species S. komarovi. The harvested leaves of the two species have a similar appearance. 

Salsola soda has also been studied as a bioremediation "biodesalinating companion plant" for crops such as tomatoes and peppers when they are grown in saline soils. The Salsola soda extracts enough sodium from the soil to improve the growth of the crop plant, and better crop yields result despite the competition of the two plants for the remaining minerals from the soil." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsola_soda[Wikipedia]

"A small, salt-tolerant succulent springtime vegetable native to the Mediterranean, Agretti is a prized delicacy in Italy and Europe. The crunchy, delicate mineral taste causes stampedes of chefs in farmer’s markets when freshly harvested bunches hit the counters, usually selling out in minutes. Traditionally served with seafood, pasta, or sautéed with oil and lemon, it has gained popularity through cooking shows and magazines. Its name means "little sour one".

A rarity amongst spring vegetables, Italian Agretti is expensive and highly sought after by those chefs and cooks in the know – mainly because of its short availability of early to late spring in Europe. In contrast, it grows easily in the US - especially in western alkaline soils – with a longer growing season, being edible into early summer instead of only in the springtime.

Its long, green foliage look like bunches of very thin green onions or thick chives with a pleasantly mineral salty flavor followed by a tartness and succulent crunch when fresh and young. The flavor is likened to a more refined version of spinach and chard. Food writer and author Frances Mayes writes that "Spinach is the closest taste, but while Agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy of spring."

An annual that grows into small shrubs up to 2 - 3' tall with fleshy green leaves on either red or green stems. Tiny flowers grow out of the base of the leaves near the stem. Best planted in early spring just after last frost, it is a cool-season crop. Germination is naturally low, but once it germinates the plants grow well with few pests. Re-seeds itself enthusiastically, so filling out a bed is not difficult. Harvest when shoots reach 6 - 8" by cutting close to the ground. Will re-grow, giving several harvests in a season. 

Other names include Barba di Frate or Friar’s Beard, Roscano, Saltwort, and barilla plant in Spanish. 

Our seed stock is grown in the western United States and well adapted to the growing conditions here."

Sanguisorba minor (salad burnet)
--------------------------------

*Overview*

"Sanguisorba minor, the salad burnet, garden burnet, small burnet, or burnet, is a plant in the family Rosaceae that is native to western, central and southern Europe; northwest Africa and southwest Western Asia; and which has naturalized in most of North America.[1][2] It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 40–90 cm tall, typically found in dry grassy meadows, often on limestone soils. It is drought-tolerant, and grows all year around.

It is used as an ingredient in both salads and dressings, having a flavor described as "light cucumber" and is considered interchangeable with mint leaves in some recipes, depending on the intended effect. Typically, the youngest leaves are used, as they tend to become bitter as they age.

Salad burnet has the same medicinal qualities as medicinal burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis). It was used as a tea to relieve diarrhea in the past.

It also has a respectable history, called a favorite herb by Francis Bacon, and was brought to the New World with the first English colonists, even getting special mention by Thomas Jefferson." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanguisorba_minor[Wikipedia]

Scorzonera hispanica (scorzonera or black salsify)
--------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Scorzonera hispanica, black salsify or Spanish salsify, also known as black oyster plant, serpent root, viper's herb, viper's grass or simply scorzonera, is a perennial member of the genus Scorzonera in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), cultivated as a root vegetable in the same way as purple salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius), also in the sunflower family.

The scorzonera sweet is a crystallized dessert made from scorzonera in Évora, Alentejo, Portugal. It is listed on the Ark of Taste.

Black salsify is native to Southern Europe and the Near East. As is indicated by its binomial name, it is generally thought to have spread to the rest of Europe from Spain, but the first mention of the vegetable by a Western writer came from Leonhard Rudolf, who reported seeing scorzonera at the market of Aleppo in Syria, in 1575. It is often claimed that the name of the genus Scorzonera derives from the Old French word scorzon meaning snake (or "adder" to be exact), which seems likely given a widespread belief that the plant makes a good antidote against bites of venomous snakes. Alternatively, the name could be derived from the Italian "scorza negra" meaning "black bark"/"black peel" and indicating the dark brown to black skin of the root. The Celtic and Germanic peoples are believed to have eaten the black salsify, which was considered efficacious against the bubonic plague and snake bites until the 16th century. The plant was being cultivated as a vegetable in Italy and France by 1660 and, soon after, the Belgians were growing vast fields of it. 

The thick black skin of the salsify root is usually considered inedible and can be removed either prior to or after boiling. If the skin is removed prior to boiling, the peeled root should be immediately immersed in water mixed with vinegar or lemon juice, in order to prevent discolouring. Since the root contains an extremely sticky latex, it is often more convenient to peel it after boiling the root for 20 to 25 minutes (or less). Residue of the latex can be removed by rubbing with a drop of oil and then washing with soap.

Black salsify is often eaten together with other vegetables, such as peas and carrots. But it is also popular served like asparagus in a white sauce, such as bechamel sauce, mustard sauce or hollandaise sauce. Boiled salsify roots may also be coated with batter and deep fried. 

Black salsify is hitherto mainly a European crop. Belgium, France and the Netherlands are the world's largest producers of black salsify; significant amounts are also produced in Germany. In the latter country, 'Hoffmanns Schwarzer Pfahl' is a cultivar widely used by commercial growers, while 'Duplex' is popular among small-scale gardeners. Some other cultivars are widely available, but because it was rather a localized crop before being produced for a wider market there are comparatively few landraces.

Harvesting is somewhat complicated, as the roots are quite fragile, and broken material loses freshness. Entire roots will keep fresh all winter if stored in a cool dark place, due to their robust black corky skin. In root cellars they may keep fresh well into springtime. It is, however, very hardy and will grow well in most cool-temperate climates and usually yield 15–20 tonnes of roots per hectare. In British gardens it is common to profit from its perennial character by leaving it in the ground until its roots have grown to sufficient size for harvesting; this can take two years. Commercially, it can be grown best as the year's second crop of a field." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorzonera_hispanica[Wikipedia]

"This root vegetable has black skin and mild-flavored white flesh. Leaves provide reliable winter greens, and bright yellow flowers in second year are edible. That’s right: three vegetables in one! Not only is this a standby and delicious winter food, but it is a true perennial perfect for the permaculture garden. We found it to be an important addition to our winter CSA alongside the burdock and salsify. Young leaves are delicious in salad and older leaves are great lightly cooked. The leaves and roots both have a nutty lettuce-like flavor. One of the few vegetables that can go through 5°F without flinching and is reputed to have survived -10°F! Hoffman’s Schwarze Pfahl is known for good size, shape, consistency and flavor. From German seed company, Bingenheimer Saatgut. Aka, Black Salsify."

"Salsify and scorzonera are good examples of vegetables that have been around for centuries but have eluded the grocery stores. Scorzonera has an oyster-like taste while Salsify's flavour has been described as more of a cross between oysters and asparagus. Some people complain that salsify is more fibrous, and harder to peel than scorzonera, while others remain loyal to Salsify. The plants are grown the same way. Grow small plantings of both, experiment a little and decide for yourself.

Scorzonera is a root vegetable with an awkward name and an ugly appearance but with a delicious oyster-like flavour. ‘Duplex’ is a fine selection with long, truncated roots with a deep black skin. The root is considered to be finer textured, and remains so further into the winter.
Duplex is popular with home gardeners, it is known for its resistance to running from seed it also appears hardier than other selections. The foliage does not die down during the heat of the summer so the plants can be also be grown for perennial greens.

The new growth at the top of the plants, called chards can also be used in spring, cooked like asparagus or used in salads. These tops can be forced in darkness, much as chicory. The roots can be peeled, boiled, chopped into pieces and served with a tasty sauce for a gourmet delicacy.
Oh, and if you let them flower, you will be pleasantly surprised. They have gorgeous bright yellow flowers that exude a pleasant aroma redolent of sweet chocolate."

Silene vulgaris (bladder campion, maidenstears, sculpit)
--------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Silene vulgaris, the bladder campion or maidenstears, is a plant species of the genus Silene of the pink family (Caryophyllaceae). It is native to Europe, where in some parts it is eaten, but is also widespread in North America, where it is a common wildflower in meadows, open woods, and fields.

The young shoots and the leaves may be used as food in some countries of the Mediterranean region. The tender leaves may be eaten raw in salads. The older leaves are usually eaten boiled or fried, sauteed with garlic as well as in omelettes. 

In Crete it is called Agriopapoula (Αγριοπάπουλα) and the locals eat its leaves and tender shoots browned in olive oil.

In Cyprus it is very widely eaten, so much that it has, in recent years, come back into being cultivated and sold in shops in bunches. Two of the common Cypriot names are Tsakrostoukkia and Strouthouthkia (στρουθούθκια). 

in Italy the leaves of this plant may be used also as an ingredient in risotto. It is commonly known as sculpit, stridolo, or by the obsolete scientific name Silene inflata, as well as sciopentin, or grixol in Veneto, and nenkuz, or sclopit in Friuli.

Formerly in La Mancha region of Spain, where Silene vulgaris leaves are valued as a green vegetable, there were people known as "collejeros" who picked these plants and sold them. Leaves are small and narrow, so it takes many plants to obtain a sizeable amount.

In La Mancha the Silene vulgaris leaves, locally known as "collejas", were mainly used to prepare a dish called gazpacho viudo (widower gazpacho). The ingredients were flatbread known as tortas de gazpacho and a stew prepared with Silene vulgaris leaves. Other dishes prepared with these leaves in Spain include "potaje de garbanzos y collejas", "huevos revueltos con collejas" and "arroz con collejas"." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silene_vulgaris[Wikipedia]

Sium sisarum (skirret)
----------------------

*Overview*

um sisarum, commonly known as skirret, is a perennial plant of the family Apiaceae sometimes grown as a root vegetable. The English name skirret is derived from the Middle English 'skirwhit' or 'skirwort', meaning 'white root'. In Scotland it is known as crummock. Its Danish name sukkerrod, Dutch name suikerwortel  and German name "Zuckerwurzel" translate as 'sugar root'.

Skirret has a cluster of bright white, sweetish, somewhat aromatic roots, each approximately 15–20 centimetres (5.9–7.9 in) in length. These are used as a vegetable in the same manner as the common salsify, black salsify and the parsnip.

The plant is of Chinese origin, but arrived in Europe by or before Roman times. It is presumed to be the siser mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a favourite of the Emperor Tiberius, though this may have also been a reference to a parsnip or carrot. 

Skirret grows about 1-metre (3 ft 3 in) high and is very resistant to cold, as well as pests and diseases. It can be grown from seeds, but may also be started from root divisions. The roots are best eaten when the plant is dormant during the winter, as in the spring, the roots become woody and covered with small hairs. Lack of moisture can also make the root more fibrous. The plant prefers sandy and moist soil. 

The roots are scrubbed, cut into lengths, boiled, and served like parsnips or carrots. Skirret roots can be stewed, baked, roasted, fried in batter as fritter, or creamed, and also be grated and used raw in salads. A woody core may be present in some roots, though this seems to be variable in different plants. If present, it should be removed before cooking because it is difficult to remove after." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sium_sisarum[Wikipedia]

*****
"(120 days) Open-pollinated. Sium sisarum Open-pollinated perennial. Native to China, skirret arrived in Europe during classical times, probably brought to the British Isles by the Romans. If you like parsnips, you’ll probably love skirret, though the wide-scale arrival of parsnips probably led to skirret’s downfall. Relatively low yielding, dainty and delicate to prepare, this is not a commercial crop. All the better for the home gardener. Skirret roots may be harvested in fall, but are customarily overwintered for their sweet nutty flavor enhanced by cold weather. In the kitchen, skirret needs a light touch; it’s best eaten raw or fried simply in butter. Skirret makes a bundle of swollen greyish-white roots from the crown, each much thinner than a parsnip. Unfussy in most soils, it has an affinity for wet or boggy land where most other vegetables do not like to grow and it can stand the toughest winters. Grows longest and straightest in sandy soil, up to 1' given adequate moisture. The widest will be almost the diameter of a pinkie. Culture like celery, starting indoors 8–10 weeks before setting out, or direct seed in spring. It can take spring frosts and transplants well. Thin to 1' apart as the umbelliferous plants will grow 3–6' and need staking if you wish to save seed. Skirret can also be propagated from root cuttings."

Tragopogon porrifolius (salsify or oyster plant)
------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Tragopogon porrifolius is a plant cultivated for its ornamental flower, edible root, and herbal properties. It also grows wild in many places and is one of the most widely known species of the salsify genus, Tragopogon. It is commonly known as purple or common salsify, oyster plant, vegetable oyster, Jerusalem star, goatsbeard or simply salsify (although these last two names are also applied to other species, as well). 

Tragopogon porrifolius is a common biennial wildflower, native to Mediterranean regions of Europe but introduced elsewhere, for example, into the British Isles (mainly in central and southern England), other parts of northern Europe, North America, and southern Africa and in Australia; in the United States it is now found growing wild in almost every state, including Hawaii, except in the extreme south-east.

The plant grows to around 1.2 m (4 ft) in height. As with other Tragopogon species, its stem is largely unbranched, and the leaves are somewhat grasslike. It exudes a milky juice from the stems.

In the UK it flowers from May to September, but in warmer areas such as California it can be found in bloom from April. The flower head is about 5 cm (2 in) across, and each is surrounded by green bracts which are longer than the petals (technically, the ligules of the ray flowers). The flowers are like that of Tragopogon pratensis, but are larger and dull purple, 3–5 cm (1 1⁄4–2 in) across. The flowers are hermaphroditic, and pollination is by insects. 

The root, and sometimes the young shoots, of T. porrifolius are used as a vegetable, and historically the plant was cultivated for that purpose; it is mentioned by classical authors such as Pliny the Elder. Cultivation in Europe began in the 16th century in France and Italy. In the United Kingdom it was initially grown for its flower and later became a mildly popular vegetable in the 18th century but then declined in popularity. Presently the root is cultivated and eaten most frequently in France, Germany, Italy and Russia. However, in modern times it has tended to be replaced by Spanish salsify (Scorzonera hispanica) as a cultivated crop. Cultivated varieties include White French, Mammoth Sandwich Island, and Improved Mammoth Sandwich Island; they are generally characterised by larger or better-shaped roots. The root becomes discolored and spoils quickly if broken, which can easily happen since it is difficult to remove from the soil without damage. The root is noted for tasting of oysters, from which the plant derives its alternative name of oyster plant; young roots can be grated for use in salads, but older roots are better cooked, and they are usually used in soups or stews. It is recommended that when using the root that, if cut, its color be preserved in acidulated water. A latex derived from the root can be used as a chewing gum. The flowering shoots can be used like asparagus, either raw or cooked, and the flowers can be added to salad, while the sprouted seeds can be used in salads or sandwiches.

The plant has also been used in herbalism, also since classical times (it is mentioned by Dioscorides), and is claimed to have beneficial effects on the liver and gallbladder. The root is regarded as a diuretic." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragopogon_porrifolius[Wikipedia]

"Yet another delicious root crop common in Europe but rarely grown here in the US. Hopefully we can change that as salsify has much to offer! Roots grow to the size and shape of imperator type carrots but are cream colored. Flavor is said to resemble oysters, in fact salsify is also known as “oyster plant.” We find this variety to have a good mild flavor, making it very versatile in the kitchen. Young roots can be eaten raw and grated in salads. Full-sized roots are best cooked. Flowering shoots can be eaten like asparagus, and flowers can be eaten whole or used as garnish. Unharvested roots bloom with vibrant purple flowers in the second year; salsify has been planted for its showy flowers alone. Used medicinally for liver and gall bladder support. Produces best when direct sown April through May. Hardy to zone 5, this variety contributed to the diversity of our winter CSA and we highly recommend it for the winter garden. Self-seeds freely if allowed to flower, which to us, isn’t a bad thing."

Vigna angularis (adzuki bean)
-----------------------------

*Overview*

"The adzuki bean (Vigna angularis; from azuki (Japanese: アズキ（小豆）); sometimes transliterated as azuki or aduki), or English red mung bean, is an annual vine widely cultivated throughout East Asia and the Himalayas for its small (approximately 5 millimetres (0.20 in) long) bean. The cultivars most familiar in Northeast Asia have a uniform red colour, but white, black, gray, and variously mottled varieties also are known. 

The wild ancestor of cultivated adzuki bean is probably Vigna angularis var. nipponensis, which is distributed across Japan, Korea, China, Nepal and Bhutan. Speciation between Vigna angularis var. nipponensis and Vigna angularis var. angularis occurred around 50,000 years ago. Archaeologists estimate it was domesticated around 3000 BC. However, adzuki beans (as well as soy beans) dating from 3000 BC to 2000 BC are indicated to still be largely within the wild size range. Enlarged seeds occurred during the later Bronze Age or Iron Age, periods with plough use. Domestication of adzuki beans resulted in a trade-off between yield and seed size. Cultivated adzuki beans have fewer but longer pods, fewer but larger seeds and a shorter stature, but also a smaller overall seed yield than wild forms. The exact place of domestication is not known; multiple domestication origins in northeast Asia (for example Japan, China, and Korea) have been suggested.

In Japan, the adzuki bean was one of the first crops subjected to scientific plant breeding. Important breeding traits are yield, pureness of the bean colour and the maturing time. Separate cultivars with smaller seeds and higher biomass are bred for fodder production and as green manure. Locally adapted cultivars are available in China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. More than 300 cultivars/landraces/breeding lines are registered in Japan.
Moreover, China (Institute of Crop Germplasm Resources (CAAS), Beijing, more than 3700 accessions) and Japan (Tokachi Agricultural Experiment Station, Hokkaido-ken, about 2500 accessions) accommodate large germplasm collections of adzuki bean.

Optimal temperature range for adzuki bean growth is between 15 °C and 30 °C. The crop is not frost-hardy and needs soil temperatures above 6-10 °C (30°-34 °C optimal) for germination. Hot temperatures stimulate vegetative growth and are therefore less favorable for pea production. The adzuki bean is usually not irrigated. Annual rainfall ranges from 500–1750 mm in areas where the bean is grown. The plant can withstand drought but severe reduction in yield is expected. The cultivation of the adzuki bean is possible on preferably well drained soils with pH 5-7.5. Fertilizer application differs widely depending on expected yield but is generally similar to soybean. Due to nodulation with rhizobia nitrogen fixation of up to 100 kg/ha is possible.

In East Asian cuisine, the adzuki bean is commonly sweetened before eating. In particular, it often is boiled with sugar, resulting in red bean paste (anko), a very common ingredient in all of these cuisines. It also is common to add flavoring to the bean paste, such as chestnut.

Red bean paste is used in many Chinese dishes, such as tangyuan, zongzi, mooncakes, baozi, and red bean ice. It also serves as a filling in Japanese sweets such as anpan, dorayaki, imagawayaki, manjū, monaka, anmitsu, taiyaki, and daifuku. A more liquid version, using adzuki beans boiled with sugar and a pinch of salt, produces a sweet dish called hong dou tang. Adzuki beans commonly are eaten sprouted, or boiled in a hot, tea-like drink. Some Asian cultures enjoy red bean paste as a filling or topping for various kinds of waffles, pastries, baked buns, or biscuits." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adzuki_bean[Wikipedia]

Vigna subterranea (Bambara nut, earth pea, hog-peanut)
------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Vigna subterranea (also known by its common names: Bambara nut, Bambara-bean, Congo goober, earth pea, ground-bean, or hog-peanut) is a member of the family Fabaceae. The plant originated in West Africa (the Bambara people are found in southern Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Senegal). Vigna subterranea ripens its pods underground, much like the peanut (also called a groundnut). They can be eaten fresh or boiled after drying.

The origin of the Bambara groundnut is West Africa and the region of cultivation is Sub-Saharan Africa's warm tropics. Bambara nut grows well any where groundnut (peanut) grows and so is vastly present from Kwara state and throughout the northern parts of Nigeria.

Bambara groundnut represents the third most important grain legume in semi-arid Africa. “It is resistant to high temperature and is suitable for marginal soils where other leguminous crops cannot be grown”. In addition, it makes very little demand on the soil and has a high nutritive value with 65% carbohydrate and 18% protein content. For these reasons it is not prone to the risk of total harvest failure even in low and uncertain rainfall regions. "Due to its high protein value it is a very important crop for people in Africa Despite its nutritional value, it is still considered as one of the prioritized neglected and underutilized species in Benin. 

The seeds are used for food and beverage because of their high protein content and for digestive system applications. The entire plant is known for soil improvement because of nitrogen fixation. In West Africa, the nuts are eaten as a snack, roasted and salted, processed into cake, or as a meal, boiled similar to other beans.

Optimal soils for Bambara groundnut production are sandy soils to prevent waterlogging. Optimal soil depth is between 50 and 100 cm, with a light soil texture. soil fertility should be low and soil pH is best suited between 5 and 6.5 and should not be lower than 4.3 or higher than 7." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_subterranea[Wikipedia]

Vigna umbellata (rice bean)
---------------------------

*Overview*

"Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi, previously Phaseolus calcaratus, is a warm-season annual vine legume with yellow flowers and small edible beans. It is commonly called ricebean or rice bean. To date, it is little known, little researched and little exploited.[where?] It is regarded as a minor food and fodder crop and is often grown as intercrop or mixed crop with maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or cowpea (V. unguiculata), as well as a sole crop in the uplands, on a very limited area. Like the other Asiatic Vigna species, ricebean is a fairly short-lived warm-season annual. Grown mainly as a dried pulse, it is also important as a fodder, a green manure and a vegetable. Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on residual soil water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown. Ricebean grows well on a range of soils. It establishes rapidly and has the potential to produce large amounts of nutritious animal fodder and high quality grain. 

Ricebean is a neglected crop, cultivated on small areas by subsistence farmers in hill areas of Nepal, northern and northeastern India, and parts of southeast Asia. It can be grown in diverse conditions and is well known among farmers for its wide adaptation and production even in marginal lands, drought-prone sloping areas, and flat rainfed tars (unirrigated, ancient alluvial river fans). It is mainly grown between 700 and 1300 m asl, although in home gardens it is found from 200 up to 2000 m. Most of the crop currently grown in Nepal is used as food for humans, with a smaller proportion used for fodder and green manuring.

Generally, ricebean is grown as an intercrop with maize, on rice bunds or on the terrace risers, as a sole crop on the uplands or as a mixed crop with maize in the khet (bunded parcels of lands where transplanted rice is grown) land. Under mixed cropping with maize it is usually broadcast some time between sowing maize and that crop’s first and second earthing up, so ricebean sowing extends from April–May to June.

Ricebean is valuable for its ability to fix nitrogen in depleted soils and in mixed cropping with local varieties of maize, as well as for its beneficial role in preventing soil erosion. The crop receives almost no inputs, and is grown on residual fertility and moisture and in marginal and exhausted soils. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the area and production of ricebean in Nepal is declining due to the introduction of high yielding maize varieties and increasing use of chemical fertilizers, while consumption is decreasing due to increased availability of more preferred pulses in the local markets. No modern plant breeding has been done and only landraces with low yield potential are grown. These have to compete with other summer legumes such as soybeans (Glycine max), black gram, cowpea, common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and horse gram (Mactrotyloma uniflorum). Other production constraints that limit the production of ricebean include small and fragmented land holdings and declining productivity. 

So far little has been done to exploit ricebean's potential: there are several features that need attention from breeders before it could be widely adopted. Most varieties are highly photoperiod sensitive, and so when grown in the subtropics are late flowering and show strong vegetative growth. Their twining habit makes them very suitable for use as intercrops with such species as maize, sorghum and possibly some of the minor millet species, which can provide support, but also makes them difficult to harvest. Many of the current varieties are susceptible to shattering, and show high levels of hard seededness. Some crop improvement work has been carried out on ricebean in India, but not in Nepal. However, the use of ricebean as a green manure crop was studied in a series of field experiments in Nepal, and this revealed that it is one of the best legumes for the purpose due to high biomass production over a short period of time, is easy to incorporate into the soil, and decomposes rapidly." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_umbellata[Amazon]

Ziziphus mauritiana (Indian jujube, Chinese date, Indian plum)
--------------------------------------------------------------

*Overview*

"Ziziphus mauritiana, also known as Chinese date, ber, Chinee apple, jujube, Indian plum, Regi pandu, Indian jujube, dunks (in Barbados) and masau, is a tropical fruit tree species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.

Ziziphus mauritiana is a spiny, evergreen shrub or small tree up to 15 m high, with trunk 40 cm or more in diameter; spreading crown; stipular spines and many drooping branches. The fruit is of variable shape and size. It can be oval, obovate, oblong or round, and can be 1-2.5 in (2.5-6.25 cm) long, depending on the variety. The flesh is white and crisp. When slightly underipe, this fruit is a bit juicy and has a pleasant aroma. The fruit's skin is smooth, glossy, thin but tight.

The species is believed to have originated in Indo-Malaysian region of South-East Asia. It is now widely naturalised throughout the Old World tropics from Southern Africa through the Middle East to the Indian Subcontinent and China, Indomalaya, and into Australasia and the Pacific Islands.

Ziziphus mauritiana is a medium-sized tree that grows vigorously and has a rapidly developing taproot, a necessary adaptation to drought conditions. The species varies widely in height, from a bushy shrub 1.5 to 2 m tall, to a tree 10 to 12 m tall with a trunk diameter of about 30 cm. Z. mauritiana may be erect or wide-spreading, with gracefully drooping thorny branches, zigzag branchlets, thornless or set with short, sharp straight or hooked spines.

This quick growing tree starts producing fruits within three years. The fruit is a soft, juicy, drupe that is 2.5 cm diameter, though in some cultivars the fruit size may reach up to 6.25 cm long and 4.5 cm wide. The form may be oval, obovate, round or oblong; the skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough. The fruit ripen at different times even on a single tree. Fruits are first green, turning yellow as they ripen. The fully mature fruit is entirely red, soft, juicy with wrinkled skin and has a pleasant aroma. The ripe fruit is sweet and sour in taste. Both flesh texture and taste are reminiscent of apples. When under ripe the flesh is white and crispy, acid to subacid to sweet in taste. Fully ripe fruits are less crisp and somewhat mealy; overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky. At first the aroma is apple like and pleasant but it becomes peculiarly musky when overripe. There is a single, hard, oval or oblate, rough central stone which contains 2 elliptic, brown seeds, 1/4 in (6mm) long. 

Propagation is most commonly from seed, where pretreatment is beneficial. Storage of the seed for 4 months to let it after-ripen improves germination. The hard stone restricts germination and cracking the shell or extraction of seeds hastens germination. Without pretreatment the seeds normally germinate within six weeks whereas extracted seeds only need one week to germinate.

Seedlings to be used as rootstock can be raised from seed. Several studies indicate that germination can be improved by soaking seeds in sulfuric acid. Germination time can also be shortened to 7 days by carefully cracking the endocarp. Ber seedlings do not tolerate transplanting, therefore the best alternatives are to sow the seeds directly in the field or to use polythene tubes placed in the nursery bed. Seedlings are ready for budding in 3 to 4 months. In addition, seedlings from the wild cultivars can be converted into improved cultivars by top-working and grafting. Nurseries are used for large scale seedling multiplication and graft production. The seedlings should also be given full light. The seedlings may need as long as 15 months in the nursery before planting in the field.

The fruit is eaten raw, pickled or used in beverages. It is quite nutritious and rich in vitamin C. It is second only to guava and much higher than citrus or apples. In India, the ripe fruits are mostly consumed raw, but are sometimes stewed. Slightly underripe fruits are candied by a process of pricking, immersing in a salt solution. Ripe fruits are preserved by sun-drying and a powder is prepared for out-of-season purposes. It contains 20 to 30% sugar, up to 2.5% protein and 12.8% carbohydrates. Fruits are also eaten in other forms, such as dried, candied, pickled, as juice, or as ber butter. In Ethiopia, the fruits are used to stupefy fish."
