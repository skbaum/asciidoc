*****
In this book, with its beautiful and naturalistic illustrations, thre is, as the title indicates,
a real return to nature; the plants are represented as they are, and not in the
conventionalised aspect which had become traditional in the earlier herbals, through
successie copying by one artists from another, without reference to the plants
themselves.  

...

The illustrations of Brunfels' herbal are incomparably better than the text, which
is very poor, and largely borrowed from previous writers.  Brunfels' knowledge of botany
was chiefly derived from the study of certain Italian authors, Manardus and
others, who spent their time in trying to identify the plants they saw
growing around them with those described by Dioscorides.  This was by no means
unreasonable in their case, since it was the plants of the Mediterranean
region that Dioscorides had enumerated.  When, however, Brunfels attempted
to employ the same methods in his examination of the flora of the Strasburg
district, and the left bank of the Rhine, many difficulties and
discrepancies arose.  He had no understanding of the geographical
distribution of plants, and did not realise that different
regions have dissimilar floras.  It is curious that should have been so, when
we remember that Theophrastus, more than eighteen hundred years earlier, had
clearly pointed out that the provinces of Asia have each their own
characteristic plants, and that some, which occur in one region,
are absent from another. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and

*****
In spite of his professional activity, Fuchs found time to produce a botanical masterpiece, which
appeared in 1542 from the press of Isingrin of Basle, under the title 'De historia stirpium.' This
was a Latin herbal dealing with about four hundred native German, and one hudred foreign
plants, and was followed in the succeeding yera by a German edition, called the 'New Kreüterbuch.'
Of all the botanists of the Renaissance, Fuchs is perhaps the one who deserves most to be
held in honour.  He is notably superior to his two predecessors in matters calling
for scholarship, such as the critical study of the plant nomenclature of
classical authors.  His herbal rivals, or even surpasses, that of
brunfels in its illustrations, and that of Bock in its
German text.

...

The wood-cuts which illustrate Fuchs' herbal are of extraordinary
beauty.  Some of them gain a special interest as being the first
European figures of certain American plants, e.g. Indian Corn and
the Great Pumpkin.

...

Fuchs arranged his work alphabetically, making no attempt at a
natural grouping of the plants, and his herbal is therefore without
importance in the history of plant classification.  His influence on
methods of plant description was, however, considerable, as is shown
by the fact that Dodoens, in his "Cruydeboeck,' took Fuchs' herbal
as a model for the order of description for each
plant. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 59-64

*****
His interest in the medical aspect of botany led him to write a herbal, and, in
order to illustrate it, he obtained the use of the woodblocks which had been
employed in the octavo edition of Fuchs' work.  To these a number of new
engravings were added.  The book was published in Dutch in the year 1554 by
Vanderloe, under the title "Cruydeboeck."  The text is not a translation
of Fuchs, as is sometimes supposed, although Dodoens too Fuchs as his
model for the order of description of each plant.
The method of arrangement is his own, and he indicates localities and
times of flowering in the Low Countries, information which clearly could
not have been derived from the earlier writer. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 72

Mattioli's 'Commentari in sex libros Pedacii Dioscoridis,' his chef-d'oeuvre, the gradual production
nad improvement of which occupied his leisure hours throughout his life, was
first published in 1544.  It was translated into many languages and appeared
in countless editions.

...

The title does not do the book justice, for it contains, besides an
exposition of Dioscorides, a Natural History dealing with all
the plants known to Mattioli.  The early editions had small
illustrations only, but, later on, editions with large and
very beautiful figures were published, such as that which appeared
in Venice in 1565. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 81-83

*****
This experience convinced Colonna that the knowledge of the identity
of the plants described by the ancients was in a most unsatisfactory
condition, and he set himself to produce a work which should remedy
this state of things.  This book was published in 1592, under the
name of 'Phytobasanos,' which embodies a quaint conceit after the
fashion of the time.  The title is a compound Greek word meaning
"plant torture," and was apparently employed by Colonna to explain
that he had subjected the plants to ordeal by torture, in order
to wrest from them the secret of their identity.  But it must be
confessed that Colonna himself is by no means free from error,
as regards the names which he assigns to them.

The great feature of the 'Phytobasanos,' however, is the
excellence of the descriptions and figures.  The latter are
famous as being the first etchings on copper used to
illustrate a botanical work.  They were an advance on all
previous plant drawings, except the work of Gesner and
Camerarius, in giving, in many cases, detailed analyses
of the flowers and fruit as well as habit
drawings. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 88

https://books.google.com/books?id=M8hfAAAAcAAJ[+https://books.google.com/books?id=M8hfAAAAcAAJ+]

*****
The first original work de l'Ecluse produced was an
account of the plants which he had observed while on an
adventurous expedition to Spain and Portugal with two
pupils.  This was so successful botanically that he
brought back two hundred new species.

...

In 1583 appeared our author's second work, which did the same service
for the botany of Austria and Hungary as the previous volume had done
for the botany of Spain.  These two works, together with some additional
matter, were republished in 1601 as the 'Rariorum plantarum historia.'
In this book, the species belonging to the same genus are often
brought together, but, beyond this, there is little attempt at
systematic arrangement.

De l'Ecluse was weak in the synthetic facility, his
strength lying rather in his powers of observation.  Cuvier
reckons that he added more than six hundred to the number of
known plants.  It is characteristic of his versatile mind,
that his botanical interests were not confined, like those
of most of the early workers, to flowering plants.  A
manuscript is preserved in the Leyden Library containing
more than eighty beautiful water-colour drawings of fungi,
executed under the direction of l'Ecluse, by artists
employed by his great friend and patron, Baron Boldizsar
de Batthyany.  This gentleman is said to have been so
enthusiastic a botanist, that he set a Turkish prisoner
at liberty, on the condition that he should obtain plants
for him from Turkey. 

...

[De l'Ecluse] deserves especial gratitude for one benefit of
a very practical nature, namely the introduction of the Potato
into Germany and
Austria. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 77-78

*****
The 'Prodromos theatri botanici' of 1620 consisted of descriptions of 600 species, which the author
regarded as new, although several had, as a matter of fact, been already described
by de l'Ecluse.  Figures of about 140 species

Bauhin's 'Pinax' converted chaos into order, since it contained the first complete and
methodical concordance of the names of plants, and was so authoritative as
to earn for the author the title of "legislateur en botanique."
The work, which dealt with about 6000 plants, was recognised as pre-eminent for
many years.

...

As Sachs long ago pointed out, this work is "the first and for that time a completely
exhaustive book of synonyms, and is still indispensible for the
history of individual species--no small praise to be given to
a work that is more than 250 years old." - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 96

The importance of Gerard's 'Herball' in the history of botany is chiefly
due to an improved edition, brought out by Thomas Johnson in 1633, thirty-six
years after the work was originally published.  ...  He greatly enlarged
the 'Herball,' and illustrated it with Plantin's woodcuts.  His edition
contained an account of no less than 2850 plants.  John also corrected
numerous errors, and the whole work, transformed by him, rose to a much
higher grade of value.  - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 113

Jean Bauhin's chief botanical work, the 'Histoire universelle des plantes,' was a most
ambitious undertaking, which he did not live to see published.
However, his son-in-law Cherler, a physician of Basle, who had helped
him in preparing it, brought out a preliminary sketch of it in
1619, and, in 1650 and 1651, the magnus opus itself was
published, under the name of 'Historia plantarum universalis.'
This book is a compilation from all sources, and includes descriptions
of 5000 plants. The figures, of which there are more than 3500, are small and
badly executed.  A large proportion of them are ultimately
derived from those of Fuchs. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 93-94

=====
"From prehistoric times to the present, the ways in which man has made flour for his bread have forged the patterns of technological progress and have greatly influenced his social development. This book describes in detail how people of the western world have ground their grain - by hand, by animal-driven wheels, by crude water-powered mills, and, finally, by complex engineering methods. The story of milling provides a graphic history of man's ingenuity in the mechanical arts, his harnessing of power sources, and his development of agricultural skill.While the central theme is the improvement of technical processes, this development is presented, not in a vacuum, but in the context of economic geography and social history. Thus the volume offers much of importance to students of social economic history, archaeology, anthropology, sociology, agriculture, and general technology, as well as those with a specific interest in milling methods.The book brings to readers some of the advantages of what was originally projected as a museum of flour milling several years ago by General Mills. Walter Dorwin Teague, the noted industrial designer, drew plans for the museum and arranged for the fundamental research, which was carried out by Dr. John Storck, anthropologist and former professor at Columbia University and Sarah Lawrence College. Hundreds of detailed drawings illustrating the processes and devices described were prepared under their direction. Although plans for the museum had to be abandoned, the extensive research and excellent illustrative material are now made available in this comprehensive, single volume history of milling and its social and economic implications."

*****
"The main object of the work here submitted to the reader is to exhibit a view of the labours of successive enquirers-in establishing a knowledge of the mechanical principles -which regulate themevements of the celestial bodies, and in explaining the various phenomena relative to their physical constitution which observation with the telescope has disclosed. It may, perhaps, be desirable to trace out briefly the plan I have pursued in attempting to execute this undertaking.

The first part of the work, extending to the close of the thirteenth chapter, is devoted to the history of the Theory of Gravitation. In the first and third chapters I have endeavoured to give some account of the immortal discoveries by which Newton established this theory in its utmost generality. The researches of the learned Prof. Rigaud have recently disclosed some interesting details respecting the original publication of the Principia, of which I have not failed to avail myself in the execution of this portion of the work.

The future history of Celestial Mechanics naturally admits of a division into two distinct periods. The first comprehends the researches of geometers from the time of Newton to the commencement of the nineteenth century. Towards the close of this period the analytical methods devised for the developement of the Theory of Gravitation had attained a high 6tate of perfection, and the various phenomena which had seemed irreconcilable with its principles, were all satisfactorily accounted for. The second period embraces the further developement of the theory down to the present time.

The third and following chapters to the ninth inclusive, are devoted to the first of the above-mentioned periods. The third chapter contains an account of the early researches of Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert on the Problem of Three Bodies, and of the application of their respective solutions to the lunar theory. The difficulty which for some time attended the computation of the movement of the lunar apogee, wa3 at length effectually removed by Clairaut, and the triumph of the Newtonian principles was practically exhibited in the construction of lunar tables by Mayer, which possessed sufficient accuracy to be employed with confidence in the solution of the great Problem of the Longitude.

It is a curious fact that, in the original edition of the Principia, Newton gave the results of an investigation of the movement of the lunar apogee, which seemed to imply that he had treated the subject by a method of a sufficiently comprehensive character. These results were suppressed by him in the second edition, doubtless in consequence of their not exhibiting so complete an accordance with observation as was manifest in his other researches on the lunar theory *. That Newton really was in possession of a method adequate to a complete investigation of the subject, is rendered still further probable by the recent researches of Mr. Adams, who, by the aid of geometrical considerations, analogous to those expounded with so much elegance in the Principia, has obtained results relative to the movement of the lunar apogee, which present a complete accordance with observation.

The fourth chapter is devoted to the early researches of geometers on the perturbations of the planets and the stability of the planetary system. While occupied with the former of these subjects, the illustrious Euler devised a method of investigation which must be regarded as one of the most remarkable in the annals of science. It consisted in regarding the perturbations of a planet as arising from an incessant change in the elements of its elliptic motion. This fertile idea was destined to acquire an immense developement from the labours of succeeding geometers.

The sublime results which the analytical researches of Lagrange and Laplace have disclosed, relative to the stability of the planetary system, while they have served to invest astronomical science with additional features of interest, are entitled to be classed among the noblest triumphs which the human mind has achieved in the investigation of the laws of the physical universe. The labours of these great geometers, which were of a kindred nature throughout their whole career, are on this occasion more especially interlaced. As some misapprehension appears to have not unfrequently arisen from this circumstance, I have endeavoured, by a careful reference to the volumes of the Academy of Sciences and other original sources, to exhibit the results independently arrived at by each geometer in the course of his researches on the subject.

The fifth chapter contains an account of the physical explanation of the great inequality in the mean longitudes of Jupiter and Saturn, and of the secular inequality in the mean motion of the Moon, as well as an allusion to several points of minor importance in the Theory of Gravitation. The irregularities in the mean longitudes of Jupiter and Saturn long continued to form an inexplicable enigma to geometers. In vain did Euler employ all the resources of his fertile genius in endeavouring to account for their existence by the principles of the Theory of Gravitation. Equally fruitless was the result of Lagrange's application of his commanding powers of analytical research to the subject. It was reserved for Laplace to detect the true origin of these anomalous phenomena in the mutual action of the two planets.

Perhaps a still more remarkable result, due to the same geometer, was the explanation of the secular inequality in the mean motion of the Moon. The records of certain eclipses of the Moon observed at Babylon about seven hundred years before the Christian era, when compared with observations of similar phenomena by the Arabian astronomers about the tenthcentury, seemed to indicate that the Moon's angular velocity round the Earth was subject to a slow acceleration. This fact was confirmed beyond all doubt by the observations of modern astronomers; but its existence seemed absolutely irreconcilable with the results to which geometers were conducted by their researches on the Theory of Gravitation. The physical cause of this acceleration continued to escape the analytical scrutinies of Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, until at length the sagacity of the lastmentioned geometer led to its detection.

The sixth chapter is devoted to an account of the labours of geometers on the Figure of the Earth, the Precession of the Equinoxes, the Libration of the Moon, and other kindred subjects. By an ingenious application of his researches on the attraction of spheroids, Newton rigorously determined the ellipticity of the Earth, upon the supposition of its density being uniform, and of the figure of an oblate spheroid being compatible with the conditions of equilibrium of a fluid mass. The truth of the last-mentioned supposition was afterwards demonstrated by Maclaurin with all the elegance and rigour of the ancient geometry. With respect to the internal structure of the Earth, the ellipticity deduced from the measurement of arcs of the meridian was totally at variance with the supposition of its homogeneity. It was reserved for Clairaut to determine the ellipticity on the more probable hypothesis of the strata increasing in density towards the centre of the Earth.

The Precession of the Equinoxes is beyond doubt the most remarkable of all the perturbative effects by which the planetary system is characterised. Its original discovery as a sidereal phenomenon is due to the great astronomer Hipparchus. The explanation of its true character was first given by Copernicus, who shewed that it might arise from a conical motion of the Earth's axis. The question relative to the physical cause of this singular movement continued to be involved in impenetrable mystery, until at length Newton discovered its origin in the disturbing action of the Sun and Moon upon the redundant matter accumulated round the terrestrial equator. The subsequent discovery of the Nutation of the Earth's Axis by Bradley introduced a new cause of complication into the subject. The complete solution of the problem of the Earth's motion round its centre of gravity, by a rigorous application of the principles of Mechanical Science, was reserved for D'Alembert. The subject of the Libration of the Moon, which is noticed in the same chapter, exhibits another striking illustration of the comprehensive character of the Theory of Gravitation in assigning the physical explanation of the various phenomena relative to the movements of the celestial bodies. The researches of Newton on this subject were perfected by Lagrange, who succeeded in obtaining results which accorded in a most satisfactory manner with those deduced from observation.

The seventh and eighth chapters embrace a somewhat detailed history of the theory of Jupiter's satellites. In the seventh chapter I have given an account of the original discovery of these bodies by the illustrious Galileo, and of the labours of subsequent astronomers in establishing the laws of their complicated movements. The eighth chapter exhibits a view of the researches of geometers, having for their object the explanation of these laws by the Theory of Gravitation. Some of the most curious effects of perturbation occur in this beautiful system. The results are mainly due to Lagrange and Laplace. The powerful character of the analysis which Laplace employed in these researches, is remarkably exhibited in the determination of the ellipticity of Jupiter by means of the derangements which the redundant matter accumulated round the equator of the planet occasions in the motions of the satellites. The illustrious geometer even boldly asserted, that the result thus derived from theory was entitled to greater reliance than that obtained by direct measurement with the micrometer!

The ninth chapter commences with a brief notice of the labours of geometers on some of the more hidden effects of perturbation. One of the most interesting of these is the gradual diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic, occasioned by the disturbing action of the planets on the earth. The sublime results arrived at by Lagrange and Laplace, relative to the stability of the planetary system, assure us that such a diminution will not continue indefinitely, but that after a certain limit of obliquity has been attained, the angle contained between the planes of the ecliptic and the equator will then commence to open out. This process will continue until the obliquity attains a certain maximum value, when the increase will be converted again into a diminution, and thus the inclination of the two planes will continually oscillate between fixed limits prescribed by the intensity of the disturbing forces. It follows as a necessary consequence, that the climate of any particular country will not undergo an essential change from this cause, such as would inevitably ensue if the equator and ecliptic were ever to coincide, or to form with each other an angle of ninety degrees. Thus the more profoundly does analysis penetrate into the operations of nature, the more admirable is the harmony which appears to pervade her various arrangements.

The subject of Comets was one of the severest tests to which the Theory of Gravitation was submitted during the early period of its history. These bodies seemed to be so destitute of any coherent structure, and at the same time so capricious in their movements, that the attempt to make them the groundwork of strict investigation was long considered to be attended with insuperable difficulties. Newton, however, perceived, with characteristic sagacity, that, however evanescent might be the physical constitution of Comets, their material structure would subject them to the influence of the principle of Gravitation; and, in pursuance of this idea, he framed a theory of their movements, according to which they all revolved in orbits resembling one or other of the conic sections, having the sun in the common focus. The apparition of the great comet of 1680 furnished him with the means of obtaining a complete verification of his theory. By a rigorous discussion of its observed positions he demonstrated incontestably that the comet revolved in an orbit which sensibly coincided with a parabola, and that the line joining it and the sun described equal areas in equal times. Halley applied Newton's theory to a vast number of recorded observations of comets, and among the results to which he was led he arrived at the conclusion that the comet of 1682 would again pass through its perihelion in the year 1758 or 1759. The actual return of this celebrated comet, agreeably to the prediction of Halley, is familiar to every reader. The effects of planetary perturbation were calculated beforehand by Clairaut, who succeeded in fixing the time of return with remarkable precision. This was unquestionably one of the greatest triumphs which had yet been achieved in the developement of the Theory of Gravitation. The general theory of the Perturbations of Cometary Bodies was a few years afterwards simplified and improved by Lagrange.

The ninth chapter closes with a brief allusion to the Mecanique Celeste. The publication of that immortal work forms an important landmark in the history of Physical Astronomy. The Theory of Gravitation, after being subjected to a succession of severe ordeals, from each of which it emerged in triumph, finally assumes an attitude of imposing majesty, which repels all further question respecting the validity of its principles.

The tenth chapter introduces the second period in the history of the Theory of Gravitation. It commences with an account of the interesting results obtained by geometers, about the beginning of the present century, relative to the variations of the elements of the planetary orbits. The highly-refined method of investigation due originally to the genius of Euler, by which the perturbations of a planet are supposed to arise from a continuous variation of the elements of elliptic motion, was now carried to a state of unexampled perfection by Lagrange, and by the combined labours of that illustrious geometer and Poisson, was rendered applicable to all the great problems of the system of the world.

After a brief notice of some of the methods employed by modern geometers in their researches on planetary perturbation, the chapter
closes with an account of the recent improvements in the lunar theory. The irregularities in the Moon's longitude, which, throughout 
the greater part of the nineteenth century, continued to occasion great embarrassment to astronomers and mathematicians, finally 
assumed a definite character, which rendered them a feasible subject of investigation with respect to their physical origin, 
when the vast mass of the Greenwich observations, extending from 1750 to 1830, were subjected to a comprehensive discussion by 
the present Astronomer Royal, and new corrections of the elements of the lunar orbit were deduced. Moreover, some hidden 
inequalities, which hitherto had totally escaped the notice of astronomers, and which seemed to be irreconcilable with theory, 
emerged from this important discussion. The explanation of the origin of these various anomalies by M. Hansen, forms an epoch 
of great importance in the history of Physical Astronomy. The complicated movements of the Moon, which had occupied the attention
of mankind from the earliest ages in the history of civilization, upon which a long succession of illustrious astronomers
and mathematicians had exerted their utmost powers of research, were at length completely analyzed, their laws clearly traced out, 
and the various resulting inequalities accounted for in strict accordance with the Theory of Gravitation. The consummation of 
this great achievement constitutes a new laurel in the wreath of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, while it imperishably
associates the already illustrious names of Airy and Hansen with the history of one of the most important departments of Astronomical Science.

The eleventh chapter is devoted to an account of the recent researches of geometers on the particular cases of perturbation which occur in the planetary system. Among the more important subjects which it embraces may be mentioned the discovery of the long inequality in the mean longitudes of the Earth and Venus, by Airy; the investigation of the perturbations of Halley's comet, on the occasion of its passage of the perihelion in 1835, by Rosenberger, Pontecoulant, and other geometers; the interesting researches of Le Verrier on various cases of cometary perturbation; the completion of Lagrange's labours on the Libration of the Moon, by Poisson; the determination of the ellipticity and mean density of the Earth, by Bessel and other enquirers; the final researches of Poisson on the motion of the Earth about its centre of gravity, and the invariability of the Sidereal Year; and the definitive detection of periodical oscillations in the Atmosphere depending on the perturbative influence of the Moon.

In the twelfth and thirteenth chapters I have endeavoured to give an account of the theoretical discovery of the planet Neptune, as it resulted from an investigation of the perturbations produced in the motion of Uranus. This may perhaps be regarded as the most astonishing conquest which the human mind has ever achieved in unfolding the arrangements of the material world. Nor does it tend to diminish our admiration of this great discovery, that it is due to the independent researches of two contemporary geometers, who, by methods totally dissimilar in their details, if not in their essential character, succeeded nearly  about the same time in determining the position of the disturbing body. The brilliant researches of M. Le Verrier on this subject constitute the strongest title which he has yet earned to the admiration of the scientific world; while those of Mr. Adams, the other discoverer of the planet, may be justly regarded as the noblest tribute which he could offer to the memory of his illustrious countryman, the great founder of Physical Astronomy. Some remarks suggested by this discovery, which it would have been inconvenient to have inserted in the body of the work, will be found in an Appendix at the end.

The thirteenth chapter. closes the history of Celestial Mechanics. Physical Astronomy, as usually understood, is confined to the researches of geometers on this subject; but in its more comprehensive sense it may be supposed to embrace the consideration of all the physical principles which are kuown to exercise an influence on celestial phenomena, as well as the study of those facts respecting the structure of the celestial bodies which admit of being explained by reference to established principles of physics. In accordance with this more enlarged signification, the subjects noticed in the greater portion of the remainder of the work ought to be considered as forming an essential part of Physical Astronomy.

The invention of the telescope about the beginning of the seventeenth century furnished the astronomer with an instrument of observation, the mighty efficacy of which can only be compared with the aid which the infinitesimal calculus affords to the geometer in his researches on the effects produced by, the continuous agency of those forces which Nature employs in her operations. Armed with such an instrument, the sagacious Galileo was soon enabled to announce a multitude of discoveries in the heavens, of startling novelty and of the highest importance. Myriads of stars whose existence bad eluded the scrutinies of the naked eye, were now seen to illumine the unfathomable regions of space. The investigation of the cosmical arrangement of the celestial bodies, and the study of their individual structure, were problems unexpectedly found to be within the reach of the human faculties. This department of astronomical science, no less remarkable for the sentiments which it is calculated to iuspire respecting the grandeur of the material universe, than for the multitude of instructive and delightful views of the physics of the celestial regions which it unfolds, has been prosecuted with ardour by a succession of eminent astronomers from Galileo's time down to the present day.

The fourteenth chapter exhibits a view of the progress of researches on the physical constitution of the bodies of the solar system, and also iucludes an account of the various discoveries by which it has been enriched in moder n times. The observations of the solar spots have suggested some highly interesting speculations respecting the great central body which forms the source of the light and heat of the system. The Moon, from her comparative proximity, has naturally given rise to much physical enquiry. The observations of the planets have disclosed a multitude of facts of a highly interesting character. Their rotatory movements round fixed axes with corresponding elliptical figures, and the diversified appearance of their surfaces, constitute striking points of analogy between them and the Earth. The remarkable phenomena visible in the polar regions of Mars, the belts of Jupiter and Saturn, and the wondrous rings of the latter planet, have all furnished abundant materials of observation and research. Nor are the satellites wanting in physical features of an important character. The relation of equality between their periods of rotation and revolution, which a variation of their brightness, in several instances, has served to establish, constitutes a striking point of analogy between them and the terrestrial satellite. The phenomena accompanying their transits and occultations are also suggestive of some interesting speculations.

This chapter introduces a name which occupies a prominent place in the remaining portion of the work—it is the immortal name of William Herschel. To the hulk of the intelligent class of readers this illustrious individual appears in the character of an astronomer distinguished by his skilful construction of huge telescopes, which he employed with marvellous success in exploring the heavens. To the student who has advanced within the precincts of astronomical science, he forms a more exalted object of admiration, as an observer of almost unrivalled acuteness and sagacity, whose exquisite faculty of discernment frequently enabled him to arrive at results far beyond the scope of the mere instrumental resources available to him; and as a philosopher of the highest order, who, by his originality of thought and capacity for comprehensive speculation, succeeded in establishing the principles of Sidereal Astronomy upon a broad and indestructible basis.

The fifteenth chapter contains an account of the progress of enquiry on the physical constitution of Comets. These mysterious bodies, beyond doubt, perform some important function in the economy of nature, which can only be ascertained by attentive observations of the phenomena which accompany their various apparitions.

The sixteenth chapter is devoted to those physical principles whose influence in disturbing the apparent positions of the celestial bodies, or in modifying the features of celestial phenomena, must necessarily be taken into account before astronomical observations can be rendered available as the groundwork of ulterior enquiry. It comprehends an account of the progress of researches on Precession, Refraction, Aberration, Nutation, Diffraction, and Irradiation. In the history of Refraction the mighty names of Newton and Laplace reappear with transcendant lustre. The correspondence between Newton and Flamsteed, published by the late Mr. Baily, has supplied some interesting materials connected with the researches of Newton on this subject. The uncertainty which so long existed respecting the construction of Newton's table of refractions, which Halley originally communicated to the Royal Society—whether it was based upon some physical theory of the subject, or whether it was calculated merely by an empiric process—has been effectually removed by the correspondence above referred to. It appears that Newton studied profoundly the theory of Astronomical Refraction, and succeeded in determining the results corresponding to various hypotheses respecting the physical constitution of the atmosphere. His suggestion to Flamsteed, recommending the practice of noting the indications of the barometer and thermometer, as a desirable accompaniment to astronomical observations, constitutes a striking illustration of the sagacity by which that great philosopher was distinguished above ordinary enquirers.

The subjects of Aberration and Nutation are introduced, with an account of the original discovery of these phenomena by the immortal Bradley. The chapter closes with an account of the most important results which have been elicited by the labours of successive enquirers on the subject of the Irradiation of Light.

The seventeenth chapter is devoted to the history of the physical enquiries connected with eclipses of the Sun and Moon, the transits of the inferior planets, and other occurrences of a similar character. These phenomena are all influenced in so great a degree by Refraction, and the other affections of light, that it would have been inconvenient to have alluded to them at an earlier stage of the work. This chapter contains a somewhat detailed exposition of the most important facts which have been observed on the occasion of the various total eclipses of the Sun recorded in history, including an investigation of the conclusions which they are calculated to suggest respecting the physical constitution of the great central body of the planetary system. The subject of the transits of Venus has naturally suggested a brief notice of the life and labours of the lamented Horrocks. There is a deep interest associated with the fate of this youthful astronomer. Although dwelling in a remote district of Lancashire, in almost entire seclusion from the rest of the scientific world, he unquestionably arrived at a juster appreciation of Kepler's discoveries than any of the successors of that great astronomer had hitherto done; while the sagacity and originality of his views on various points relating to astronomy, bis fertile and glowing imagination, and his ardent enthusiasm in the pursuit of science—all seemed to foreshadow a career of uncommon brilliancy, which a premature death unfortunately soon brought to a close. Even his brief labours, however, have assured to him a reputation which will live imperishably in the annals of science. By his own countrymen he cannot fail to be regarded with peculiar interest, as the morning star of a galaxy of men of genius, who continued for about a century to adorn these isles by their successful cultivation of the physico-mathematical sciences. The names of Horrocks, Gascoigne, Brouncker, Barrow, Wallis, Wren, Gregory, Hooke, Newton, Taylor, Bradley, Simpson, and Maclaurin, represent a constellation of scientific enquirers, which for splendour of genius and high intellectual endowments has never been surpassed, and rarely equalled, during a similar period in the history of any nation, whether of ancient or modern times.

As any work relating to astronomical science would be incomplete without 6ome allusion to the important subject of observation, the eighteenth chapter has been devoted to a condensed account of the progress of Practical Astronomy, from the earliest ages down to the present time. The annals of physical science do not, perhaps, furnish a more interesting picture of gradual advancement towards perfection than that which exhibits the successive improvements effected in this department of astronomy—from the naked estimations of the Chaldean priests to the refined and complicated methods of observation practised by modern astronomers—from the gnomon and the clepsydra, in their most rudimentary forms, to the transit circle of the Greenwich Observatory, the pendulum clock of the most improved construction, and the electro-magnetic recording apparatus of the American astronomers.

In this chapter I have given a somewhat detailed account of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, from its origin down to the present time. The observations which have emanated from that noble establishment have proved of incalculable service to astronomical science. No other similar institution, whether of ancient or modern times, can compare with it in this respect. Its history affords an instructive lesson regarding the advantage to be derived from applying the resources of an observatory to some definite object, and maintaining that object in view with unswerving constancy of purpose. An uninterrupted succession of eminent astronomers, who have directed the labours of this establishment, have contributed to render it the storehouse from which the materials for determining the elements of Astronomical Science have been mainly derived in modern times. With the triumphs of the Theory of Gravitation its history is inseparably associated. During the early period of its existence, it had the glory of supplying Newton with a series of observations, which served as a valuable guide to him while engaged in threading his way through the intricacies of the lunar theory, and it has continued ever since to furnish almost exclusively the astronomical facts, by an appeal to which the successors of that illustrious geometer have been enabled to establish the accuracy of their theoretical results. The recent reduction of the entire mass of the Greenwich Observations of the Moon and Planets, extending from 1750 to 1830, under the superintendence of the present Astronomer Royal, is an achievement which, while in respect of vastuess it has few parallels in the annals of science, at the same time forms one of the most valuable acquisitions which Astronomy has received during the present century.

As a fitting sequel to the subject above-mentioned, the nineteenth chapter contains a brief account of the labours of astronomers in the construction of Catalogues of Stars. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this department of Astronomical Science. The places of the stars constitute so many fundamental facts, upon which depend all exact conclusions relative to the movements of the planetary bodies. The labours connected with their determination afford ample scope for talents of the highest order; but it must be acknowledged that they offer little to captivate either the imagination or the intellect, while at the same time they demand the most arduous exercise of the attention, and the most unflinching perseverance. Despite these disadvantages, there have not been wanting numerous examples of astronomers who, disregarding the eclat which usually attends discovery, have devoted the best portion of their lives to the construction of a Catalogue of Stars. Lacaille, Piazzi, and Groombridge will be especially remembered in the annals of astronomy, as individuals who sacrificed their days and nights with unwearied assiduity to this object, cheered only by the consciousness of the advantages which posterity would derive from their labours, and by the secret charm which a constant intercourse with nature never fails to yield.

The twentieth chapter contains the history of the Telescope. The researches of Van Swinden have recently contributed to throw much interesting light upon the original invention of that instrument.

The twenty-first chapter, which completes the work, is devoted to a condensed account of the progress of researches in Stellar Astronomy. The labours of modern enquirers in this department of Astronomical Science have led to some conclusions of a highly interesting and important nature. The existence of a sensible parallax in the fixed stars—a question which has occasioned much anxious investigation from the time of Copernicus down to the present day—has at length been definitively established in several instances by the labours of Bessel, Henderson, Struve, Peters, and Maclear. It is now ascertained beyond all doubt, that light, travelling at the rate of 192,000 miles in a second, would require three years and a half to traverse the space between one of the nearest of those luminaries and the earth! The motion of the solar system in space, is another of those sublime conclusions which have been established by the researches of modern astronomers. It appears from the labours of Sir William Herschel and his successors on this subject, that not only do the satellites move round the planets, and the planets round the Sun, but that the Sun, with his whole cortege of planets and satellites, is being constantly transported through space to a determinate point in the heavens, revolving, in all probability, round the centre of gravity of some vast system of suns, of which it forms one of the constituent members. Thus the farther the human mind is allowed to penetrate into the mechanism of the physical universe, the more overwhelming is the impression produced of the surpassing grandeur of its movements, and the more exalted is the conception formed of the Omnipotent Being who constantly presides over its countless arrangements.

To the student of Celestial Physics, the researches of astronomers on Double Stars offer a high degree of interest, inasmuch as they serve to demonstrate that the law of Gravitation, as announced by Newton, actually prevails in the mutual action of those remote bodies of the universe. The phenomena of Nebulae excited little interest among astronomers until they attracted the attention of Sir William Herschel. The vast extent of that astronomer's observations of those objects, and the originality of his views on their physical constitution, had the effect of elevating them to a high degree of importance in sidereal astronomy. The subsequent labours of Sir John Herschel and Lord Rosse, in the same field of enquiry, have materially contributed to the advancement of our knowledge respecting those wonderful structures.

After a rapid view of the progress of research on the various subjects above mentioned, allusion is made to the labours of astronomers on the physical constitution of the Milky Way and the Distribution of the Stars in space. The chapter concludes with a brief account of the interesting speculations of M. Struve on the Extinction of Light in its passage through space.

In the prosecution of these labours I have generally endeavoured to elucidate the various facts of history by reference to the fundamental principles of astronomical science, adhering as closely as possible to the ordinary phraseology of language. Occasionally, however, the subject considered, does not naturally admit of concise elucidation, so that an adherence to this practice would have led to inconvenient—I had almost said interminable—digressions. On the other hand, to have omitted all allusion to such subjects would have been to sacrifice the principle of continuity which forms so essential an attribute of history, and to present the reader with an avowedly mutilated work. I have endeavoured to avoid these two extremes, by noticing every fact which seemed to constitute an essential link in the chain of historic exposition, but studiously aiming at conciseness in all those instances wherein explanation would be necessarily so prolix as to defeat its own object. This remark applies more particularly to the subjects relating to the Theory of Gravitation. With respect to the remaining portion of the work, it is to be hoped that no reader possessing an ordinary acquaintance with the elements of astronomical science can experience any difficulty in pursuing it through its details.

"Here is an unusual book for anyone who appreciates the beauty and wonder of the stars. Solidly based upon years of thorough research into astronomical writings and observations of the ancient Chinese, Arabic, Euphrates, Hellenic, and Roman civilizations, it is an informative, non-technical excursion into the vast heritage of folklore and history associated with the heavenly bodies.

From his studies of the writings of scores of ancient astronomers, the author has come up with a fascinating history of the names various cultures have given the constellations, the literary and folkloristic uses that have been made of the stars through the centuries, and the often incredible associations that ancient peoples established with the stars. He covers, for example, the origins of the lunar and solar zodiacs; the use of stars and constellations in the Bible and other sacred writings, poetry, etc.; the idea of the Milky Way; how star pictures were originally set up and why; astrology and the use of stars to tell people's fortunes; and many other star curiosities. In this regard, the book touches upon not only all of the constellations (including many that long ago dropped out of star catalogues), but their important stars and such other asterisms as the Hyades, the Pleiades, the Great Nebula of Andromeda, and the Magellanic Clouds.

The book is the only complete coverage of its kind in English. It is completely non-technical, hence accessible to etymologists, anthropologists, and amateur star-gazers. But it contains so much unique reading material on early astronomical theory, so many delightful accounts drawn from the pages of books almost impossible to find today, that even the practicing astronomer will find it refreshingly new and instructive."

-----
"Based on a series of lectures delivered at Cornell University in the fall of 1949, and since revised, this is the standard non-technical coverage of Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics and astronomy, and their transmission to the Hellenistic world. Entirely modern in its data and conclusions, it reveals the surprising sophistication of certain areas of early science, particularly Babylonian mathematics.

After a discussion of the number systems used in the ancient Near East (contrasting the Egyptian method of additive computations with unit fractions and Babylonian place values), Dr. Neugebauer covers Babylonian tables for numerical computation, approximations of the square root of 2 (with implications that the Pythagorean Theorem was known more than a thousand years before Pythagoras), Pythagorean numbers, quadratic equations with two unknowns, special cases of logarithms and various other algebraic and geometric cases. Babylonian strength in algebraic and numerical work reveals a level of mathematical development in many aspects comparable to the mathematics of the early Renaissance in Europe. This is in contrast to the relatively primitive Egyptian mathematics. In the realm of astronomy, too, Dr. Neugebauer describes an unexpected sophistication, which is interpreted less as the result of millennia of observations (as used to be the interpretation) than as a competent mathematical apparatus. The transmission of this early science and its further development in Hellenistic times is also described. An Appendix discusses certain aspects of Greek astronomy and the indebtedness of the Copernican system to Ptolemaic and Islamic methods."

"The Great Copernicus Chase is an anthology of 36 incidents drawn from the history of astronomy. The chapters range from Stonehenge and ancient Egypt, to the Great Comet of 1965, and to Albert Einstein. In this series of articles, arranged roughly chronologically, Professor Gingerich covers all the important periods and developments in astronomy. The book is generously illustrated throughout, and opportunity has been taken to add illustrations to articles that originally had none. The curious reader will learn of the origin of the zodiac, Islamic astronomy, fake astrolabes, the foundation of modern astronomy in the USA, and the discovery of the spiral arms of our Galaxy. Although Professor Gingerich prepared this material primarily for readers interested in the historical background to astronomy, there are many original research discoveries and insights. This is popularization and intellectual history combined. The Copernicus Chase refers to Owen Gingerich's attempt to make a census of all extant copies of De Revolutionibus. Some of the many adventures that have befallen him in this quest feature in the book."

https://books.google.com/books?id=mEdeJstvtkQC[+https://books.google.com/books?id=mEdeJstvtkQC+]

-----
"A History of Arabic Astronomy is a comprehensive survey of Arabic planetary theories from the eleventh century to the fifteenth century based on recent manuscript discoveries. George Saliba argues that the medieval period, often called a period of decline in Islamic intellectual history, was scientifically speaking, a very productive period in which astronomical theories of the highest order were produced.

Based on the most recent manuscript discoveries, this book broadly surveys developments in Arabic planetary theories from the eleventh century to the fifteenth. Taken together, the primary texts and essays assembled in this book reverse traditional beliefs about the rise and fall of Arabic science, demonstrating how the traditional “age of decline” in Arabic science was indeed a “Golden Age” as far as astronomy was concerned.

Some of the techniques and mathematical theorems developed during this period were identical to those which were employed by Copernicus in developing his own non-Ptolemaic astronomy. Significantly, this volume will shed much-needed light on the conditions under which such theories were developed in medieval Islam. It clearly demonstrates the distinction that was drawn between astronomical activities and astrological ones, and reveals, contrary to common perceptions about medieval Islam, the accommodation that was obviously reached between religion and astronomy, and the degree to which astronomical planetary theories were supported, and at times even financed, by the religious community itself. This in stark contrast to the systematic attacks leveled by the same religious community against astrology."

"This book is the most comprehensive and authoritative survey to date of world astronomy before the invention of the telescope in AD 1609. International experts in every field have contributed chapters examining what observations were made, what instruments were used, the effect of developments in mathematics and measurement, and the diversity of early views of cosmology and astrology. A final chapter shows the importance to modern astronomers of the celestial observations recorded by their ancient predecessors, and especially their relevance to astrophysics, solar system studies and geophysics."

https://books.google.com/books?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&dq[+https://books.google.com/books?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&dq+]

-----
"The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy combines new scholarship with hands-on science to bring readers into direct contact with the work of ancient astronomers. While tracing ideas from ancient Babylon to sixteenth-century Europe, the book places its greatest emphasis on the Greek period, when astronomers developed the geometric and philosophical ideas that have determined the subsequent character of Western astronomy. The author approaches this history through the concrete details of ancient astronomical practice. Carefully organized and generously illustrated, the book can teach readers how to do real astronomy using the methods of ancient astronomers. For example, readers will learn to predict the next retrograde motion of Jupiter using either the arithmetical methods of the Babylonians or the geometric methods of Ptolemy. They will learn how to use an astrolabe and how to design sundials using Greek and Roman techniques. The book also contains supplementary exercises and patterns for making some working astronomical instruments, including an astrolabe and an equatorium. More than a presentation of astronomical methods, the book provides a critical look at the evidence used to reconstruct ancient astronomy. It includes extensive excerpts from ancient texts, meticulous documentation, and lively discussions of the role of astronomy in the various cultures."

"The search for understanding creates more than answers; it also produces instruments, books, maps, and other tools made and used by those seeking knowledge. The Universe Unveiled uniquely focuses on these artifacts and devices resulting from the attempts to decipher the Universe from the late fifteenth to the early twentieth century. Beautiful, full-color photographs capture these extremely rare and sometimes unusual curios. Beginning with the discovery of ways to keep time, The Universe Unveiled depicts the shift from an Earth-centered understanding of the Universe to a Sun-centered view, the mapping of the stars, and the ever-expanding knowledge of the heavens using telescopes. It also examines the developing technologies of navigation and of the measuring and mapping of the Earth. In addition to rare European curios, the book is illustrated with non-Western and American works. With more than 250 full-color images, this unique volume will delight the inventive as well as the curious."

"Almost thirty years after the Apollo missions, "Tranquillity Base", "Hadley Rille", or "Taurus-Littrow" are names still resonant with the enormous achievements represented by the lunar landings. But how did these places get their names? Who named Copernicus crater? Where did all those names on lunar maps come from, and what stimulated their selection? Ewen Whitaker traces the origins and evolution of the present-day systems for naming lunar features such as craters, mountains, valleys and dark spots. The connections between the prehistoric and historic names, and today's gazetteer are clearly described. Beautiful lunar maps spanning four centuries of progress wonderfully illustrate the unfolding of our ability to map the Moon. Rare, early photographs add to the sense of history. Comprehensive appendices and the bibliography make this delightful book a work of lasting reference and scholarship."

"What are the parts of the universe? How are they arranged? Where are its center and its boundaries? What forces control its motion? Cosmographical Glass features more than 100 astronomical and mythical diagrams from books printed before 1700, revealing how people of the Renaissance answered these complicated questions. Throughout this period, which one historian has called "the most psychically disturbed era in European history," the universe was depicted as a rational arrangement of disparate parts. The author bridges the gap between the Renaissance and today by explaining in detail these astronomical, mythical, and alchemical maps of the universe."

"The collection of papers assembled here on a variety of topics in ancient and medieval astronomy was originally suggested by Noel Swerdlow of the University of Chicago. He was also instrumental in making a selection* which would, in general, be on the same level as my book The Exact Sciences in Antiquity. It may also provide a general background for my more technical History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy and for my edition of Astronomi cal Cuneiform Texts. Several of these republished articles were written because I wanted to put to rest well-entrenched historical myths which could not withstand close scrutiny of the sources. Examples are the supposed astronomical origin of the Egyptian calendar (see [9]), the discovery of precession by the Babylonians [16], and the "simplification" of the Ptolemaic system in Copernicus' De Revolutionibus [40]. In all of my work I have striven to present as accurately as I could what the original sources reveal (which is often very different from the received view). Thus, in [32] discussion of the technical terminology illuminates the meaning of an ancient passage which has been frequently misused to support modern theories about ancient heliocentrism; in [33] an almost isolated instance reveals how Greek world-maps really looked; and in [43] the Alexandrian Easter computus, held in awe by many historians, is shown from Ethiopic sources to be based on very simple procedures."

"From Egypt and Classical Greece and Rome through the building booms of the Gothic era and the Renaissance, and from the Industrial Revolution to the present era of digital modeling, Building: 3,000 Years of Design, Engineering, and Construction,charts centuries of innovations in engineering and building construction. This comprehensive and heavily illustrated volume, aimed at students and young professionals as well as general readers, explores the materials, classic texts, instruments, and theories that have propelled modern engineering, and the famous and not-so-famous buildings designed through the ages, from the Parthenon to Chartres Cathedral and the dome of St. Peter's, from eighteenth-century silk mills in England to the Crystal Palace, and on to the first Chicago high-rises, the Sydney Opera House, and the latest "green" skyscrapers.

The book concentrates on developments since the industrial and scientific revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Incorporated within the continuous narrative are sidebars with short biographies of eminent engineers, excerpts from classic texts, stories of individual projects of major importance, and brief histories of key concepts such as calculus. Also included are extensive reference materials: appendices, a glossary, bibliography, and index."
