Marc Leclair, better known by his stage name Akufen, is a Canadian electronic musician. His music is electronic music that is often described as minimal house, minimal techno, glitch, or microhouse.

His 2002 release titled My Way introduced his concept of "microsampling", which was essentially a way of using extremely small and short clips of samples he had randomly recorded from FM radio broadcasts as a key musical element.[1][2]

Leclair's pseudonym comes from the French word for tinnitus (ringing of the ears), acouphène, and he has also gone under the pseudonyms Horror Inc., David Scott, Nefuka, and Anna Kaufen.

Since 1999, Akufen (Montreal's Marc Leclair) has been amassing a thick stockpile of 12" releases for labels like Perlon, Background, Traum, Oral, Trapez, and Force Inc. With influences ranging from Bootsy to Mancini to Moroder to Reich, Leclair's productions veer from challenging experimental techno to pop-oriented micro-house. For most of the tracks on 2002's My Way, his first full-length album for Force Inc., Leclair employed a technique he referred to as "microsampling." Leclair would spend hours of each morning recording material from AM/FM dials and a shortwave, and he would then use those recordings as fodder for his productions, splicing seconds into minute fragments (consisting of voices, song snippets, acoustic guitar flicks, and all sorts of unidentifiable moments) and applying them to danceable, hook-heavy house tracks. The anticipation for the album was increased significantly by a limited release of the album's feature cut, "Deck the House," a dazzling crazy-quilt of short-attention-span house dementia. 

My Way received widespread acclaim, and it was followed by a remix 12" and an EP titled Hawaiian Wodka Party in 2003. Akufen's first mix CD, Fabric 17, appeared in 2004. That same year, he also shared a split CD called Blu TribunL with Freeform and the Rip-Off Artist. All of the album's tracks were based on blues samples. Leclair released a more experimental album under his own name in 2005, and was largely inactive until the early 2010s. Akufen's Battlestar Galacticlown EP appeared on Musique Risquée in 2012, and a digital EP of previously unreleased tracks from 2008 called Dollhouse also appeared. Following a 2013 full-length under the name Horror Inc., Akufen returned in late 2016 with EP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Alcaide[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Alcaide+]

Ana Alcaide (born 1976, Madrid, Spain) is a Spanish performer, composer and music producer who carries out research on ancient traditions and cultures.

At the age of seven Alcaide took up classical violin. She studied at the Getafe Conservatory of Music (Madrid) and later at Lund University (Sweden). She has received formal scientific and musical training in several countries (Spain, Sweden and Mexico) and holds a biology degree with a specialization in botany from the University of Complutense in Madrid.

After being awarded a biology scholarship in 2000, Alcaide travelled to Sweden where she was first exposed to the Nyckelharpa, a traditional Swedish instrument that dates from medieval times. Attracted by the complexity and depth of its sound, Alcaide taught herself how to play the nyckelharpa on the streets of Toledo, Spain.

In 2005 she returned to Sweden to further pursue her music studies and to specialize in this Swedish folk instrument. During this time she was also influenced by other musical traditions and began studying other instruments and voice. She graduated from Malmö Academy of Music (Bachelor in Performing Arts) after successfully completing a personalized program in which she focused on world music, combining her interest in traditional music with the study of more modern techniques.

Alcaide published her debut album Viola de Teclas ("Keyed Viola", an alternative name for the nyckelharpa in Spanish) in 2006. She has played a pioneering role in introducing and popularizing the nyckelharpa in Spain.[1] Her second album, Como la luna y el sol, was the result of the final degree project she completed while at the Malmö Academy of Music. This album features interpretations of traditional Sephardic music.[2] In late 2009 she compiled her first three years of work on the DVD Ana Alcaide en concierto, which was filmed in a historic Jewish synagogue (‘El Tránsito’ – Toledo, Spain) alongside her usual collaborators. In 2012, after taking time off to have her first child, Alcaide released her third album, La cantiga del fuego.

Arrogant Worms

https://www.arrogantworms.com/[+https://www.arrogantworms.com/+]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arrogant_Worms[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arrogant_Worms+]

The Arrogant Worms are a Canadian musical comedy trio that parody many musical genres. They are well known for their humorous on-stage banter in addition to their music. 

The Arrogant Worms came together in 1991 to do a few spots on campus radio station CFRC in Kingston, Ontario,[1] and quickly moved to doing spots on CBC Radio, particularly on Jack Farr's The Radio Show. Since 1992 the troupe has released fifteen CDs. Their most recent album, The First Farewell Album, was released in November 2016. The Worms have toured in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

Each album consists mostly of independent tracks paying homage, always humorously, to different genres and topics. Two exceptions are the 1997 Live Bait and 2003 Semi-Conducted CDs, which are live albums, comprising collections of their best songs. Semi-Conducted is performed with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.

Rock, folk, ballads, country, and children's music all have been genres parodied by the Worms.

When not spoofing a particular style of music, the Worms' material pokes fun at various aspects of daily life in Canada with songs like "Canada's Really Big", "Me Like Hockey", "We are the Beaver", "I Am Not American", and "Proud to Be Canadian".

Art Ensemble of Chicago
-----------------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-art-ensemble-of-chicago-mn0000600734/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-art-ensemble-of-chicago-mn0000600734/biography+]

Originally comprised of saxophonists Roscoe Mitchell and Joseph Jarman, trumpeter Lester Bowie, bassist Malachi Favors, and later, drummer Famoudou Don Moye, the Art Ensemble of Chicago enjoy a critical reputation as most influential avant-garde jazz ensemble of the 1970s and '80s. During the late '60s and early '70s, the Art Ensemble helped pioneer the fusion of jazz with European art music and indigenous African folk styles. The band also combined music from sanctified church services, minstrel shows, and bawdy houses of late 19th and early 20th century America -- with a modernist spirit and lively stage show that involved face paint and costumes as well as literally hundreds of musical instruments. A pronounced theatrical element was essential to their work. Its members attained a measure of jazz stardom on their own -- particularly Bowie and, to a lesser extent, Mitchell -- but in the Art Ensemble, no single player was greater than the whole. Whether it was 1968's People in Sorrow or Les Stances a Sophie with Fontella Bass, the group's profound groundbreaking recordings for ECM in the '80s and '90s, or with DIW in the new century, the Art Ensemble grew in stature and influence as ambassadors of avant jazz; all of its members were savvy composers and improvisers. 

The group grew out of the Roscoe Mitchell Art Ensemble of the mid-'60s, which had in turn grown out of Chicago pianist Muhal Richard Abrams' Experimental Band of the early '60s. The latter was a rehearsal band, created for the purpose of playing scores written by many of the city's forward-thinking young African American jazz composers. It attracted, among others, Mitchell, Jarman, and Favors. The two saxophonists had both served in the military, though not together; they met while students at Wilson Junior College. Favors had been an established member of the Chicago jazz scene since the '50s. All three were early members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), a collective organized by Abrams and several like-minded fellow musicians. Lester Bowie moved to Chicago from St. Louis in 1966. Within days of arriving, he began rehearsing with Mitchell. In 1966, the Roscoe Mitchell Sextet (with Bowie and Favors) recorded Sound, the first album to come out of the AACM. In August 1967, Bowie recorded Numbers 1&2 for Delmark; on "2," the four musicians who would become the Art Ensemble recorded together for the first time. As the Roscoe Mitchell Art Ensemble, the band performed sans drummer for the next two years. In 1969 the band moved to Paris, where they met and hired "Sun Percussionist" Don Moye, who had come to Europe from Detroit with trumpeter Charles Moore's band. Renamed the Art Ensemble of Chicago, the group had a great deal of success in Europe, recording classic albums like Reese and the Smooth Ones (BYG) and People in Sorrow (Nessa). They moved back to Chicago in 1971; their 1972 homecoming concert was recorded and issued as Live at Mandel Hall (Delmark). 

The band's renown grew in the '70s. In 1978 they formed their own label, AECO, which released solo recordings by Jarman, Moye, and Favors. The group recorded for ECM in the late '70s and early '80s, making a series of critically acclaimed albums, including Nice Guys, Full Force, Urban Bushmen, and The Third Decade. The band won a series of critic's polls and was considered by many to be the finest jazz ensemble in the world. In the latter half of the '80s, a general decline in critical enthusiasm for the avant-garde resulted in less attention being paid to bands like the Art Ensemble. Side projects by individual bandmembers also seem to have had an effect on the band's vitality. Still, it continued to exist, concertizing and recording through the '90s, occasionally with guests and supplementary musicians. Jarman left the band in 1993 in order to devote himself full-time to spiritual matters. The band continued as a quartet. Bowie was stricken with liver cancer; for the band's June 1999 concert at the Boston Globe Jazz and Blues Festival, he was replaced by saxophonist Ari Brown. Bowie died in November of 1999. For its first concert following Bowie's death, a January 2000 date at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, the Art Ensemble performed as a trio. Although its remaining members were still capable of creating at a very high level, by the turn of the millennium, the Art Ensemble's future seemed in doubt. That said, the AEC continued to perform and record together, issuing Live in Milano in 2001 and Zero Sun No Point: Dedication to Mynona & Sun Ra with Hartmut Geerken in 2002. Four albums were issued during the fateful year of 2003, including The Meeting on Pi Recordings, Tribute to Lester on ECM, Urban Magic on Musica Jazz and Reunion on Il Manifesto. But tragedy struck again when Favors passed away. In September of 2004, Sirius Calling (on Pi) offered the final studio recordings of the AEC with the bassist. Jaribu Shahid took over the chair for 2006's Non-Cognitive Aspects of the City: Live at Iridium. From then on, the Art Ensemble performed live only rarely given its members demanding schedules, and released only archival recordings. Jarman, a longtime Buddhist priest, eventually retired. 

In October of 2017, Moye and Mitchell celebrated the AEC's 50th anniversary with a series of concerts at London's Cafe OTO with bassist Junius Paul and trumpeter Hugh Ragin; the second night the ensemble expanded to include cellist Tomeka Reid, double bassist Silvia Bolognesi, and violinist/vocalist Mazz Swift. The following year, at the 22nd annual Edgefest in Ann Arbor, the Art Ensemble's two remaining members performed for two evenings. One night featured them in the presence of Detroit friends, while the second evening placed them center stage in a 14-piece group that included Reid, Shahid (in addition to Paul and Bolognesi), and flutist Nicole Mitchell. In November, ECM released the limited-edition 21-disc box, The Art Ensemble of Chicago and Associated Ensembles. It featured the band's entire recorded output for the label as well as its individual members' solo dates and other AACM-associated recordings from Leo Smith and Jack DeJohnette.

Canada's A Tribe Called Red are an acclaimed electronic DJ collective known for their genre-bending mix of hip-hop, reggae, dubstep and First Nations musical traditions. Formed in 2007, A Tribe Called Red showcases the talents of DJs Ian "DJ NDN" Campeau of the Nipissing First Nation, Bear Witness of the Cayuga First Nation, and Tim "2oolman" Hill, Mohawk, of the Six Nations of the Grand River (who replaced Dan "DJ Shub" General, Mohawk, of the Six Nations of the Grand River in 2014). After recording several EPs, the group officially debuted in 2012 with their full-length self-titled album, which found the trio longlisted for the Polaris Music Prize. Their sophomore effort, 2013's Nation II Nation, also made it onto the Polaris shortlist, finishing in the final ten. That same year, A Tribe Called Red took home Best Group and Best Album at the Aboriginal People's Choice Music Awards. The following year, they garnered even more attention after taking home the Juno Award for Breakthrough Album of the Year. In 2016, A Tribe Called Red returned with their third full-length album, We Are the Halluci Nation, featuring guest appearances from rapper Yasiin Bey (aka Mos Def), indigenous Canadian drum group Black Bear, Australia's OKA, and others.

A Tribe Called Red (often abbreviated as ATCR) is a Canadian electronic music group, who blend instrumental hip hop, reggae, moombahton and dubstep-influenced dance music with elements of First Nations music, particularly vocal chanting and drumming.[1] Based in Ottawa, Ontario, the group consists of Tim "2oolman" Hill (Mohawk, of the Six Nations of the Grand River), and Ehren "Bear Witness" Thomas (of the Cayuga First Nation).[2] Former members include co-founder DJ Jon Deck and Dan "DJ Shub" General (of the Cayuga First Nation),[3] who left the band for personal reasons in spring 2014, and was replaced by Hill.[4] Co-founder Ian "DJ NDN" Campeau (of the Nipissing First Nation) left the band for health reasons in October 2017, with the band opting to remain a duo for the time being.[5]

The group's name is an homage to A Tribe Called Quest, a hip hop group that also had songs that addressed African American social grievances.[6]

The group's music has been described as "powwow-step", a style of contemporary powwow music for urban First Nations in the dance club scene; popularized by the media as a description of the band's unique style, the term originated as the title of one of the band's own earliest singles.

As Badly Drawn Boy, Damon Gough puts a fresh spin on the traditions of Nick Drake, Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, and other classic singer/songwriters. When he emerged in the late '90s, his intricate, lilting melodies, quirky but heartfelt lyrics, and offbeat production touches fit in with the experimental pop fringe of artists like Scott 4 and the Beta Band, but Gough soon defined himself as a remarkable talent with 2000's The Hour of Bewilderbeast, his Mercury Prize-winning debut album. He struck gold again with the 2002 soundtrack About a Boy, which polished the charm of his songwriting while avoiding sentimentality. Later, he embellished his sound with ornate production, as on 2002's Have You Fed the Fish? and 2006's Born in the U.K., then returned to the relatively stripped-down sound of his earlier work on 2010's It's What I'm Thinking, Pt. 1: Photographing Snowflakes. With 2020's Banana Skin Shoes, Gough returned from a lengthy hiatus with an even-handed mix of adventurous pop and poignant ballads.

Banda Do Casaco
---------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_do_Casaco[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_do_Casaco+]

"Banda do Casaco are a Portuguese Prog-Folk band active from 1974 to 1984 considered by some to be one of Portugal's greatest Progressive rock bands. Their seminal album was the Hoje há Conquilhas, Amanhã não Sabemos released in 1976. 

After the failure of the Filarmónica Fraude project, more for political reasons than quality, António Pinho (singer) and Luís Linhares (keys) joined with the ex Musica Novarum member Nuno Rodrigues (vocals and guitar) and Celso de Carvalho (Cello and Double bass) to form the group Banda do Casaco. Many guest musicians passed through the band in their active period and many used the band as a springboard for their own careers. 

The first album released was 1975's Dos Benefícios de um Vendido no Reino dos Bonifácios followed by Coisas do Arco da Velha in 1976 which won the "Album of the Year" award in Portugal, notable for the appearance of Cândida Branca Flor on vocals. Their most renowned and considered by some, their most experimental, album was their 1977 release Hoje há Conquilhas, Amanhã não Sabemos which featured António Pinheiro da Silva on guitar, Rão Kyao on saxophone and Gabriela Schaaf on vocals. They went on to release Contos da Barbearia in 1978 followed by No Jardim da Celeste in 1981 which featured the inclusion of female singer Né Ladeiras and Jerry Marotta, Peter Gabriel's former drummer. The band played live on only three occasions: at Aula Magna, Festa de S. Mateus in Viseu and Casa do Povo in Cacia. In 1982 Pinho left the group to write for girlband Doce but the band continued and released Também Eu in 1982. The band's final studio album was Com Ti Chitas, released in 1984, which featured Ti Chitas (Catarina Sergentina). The group disbanded shortly after.

The group joined traditional Portuguese folk music with Progressive rock and their lyrics were often satirical and included social criticism, approaching the idea of crossing modern urbanisation with Portuguese rural history. The band consisted of eight members with instruments including brass, keyboards, strings (violin, cello, contra bass) and vocals (two female vocalists: Judi Brennan and Helena Afonso).

Beats Antique is a U.S.-based experimental world fusion and electronic music group. Formed in 2007 in conjunction with producer Miles Copeland, the group has become noted for their mix of different genres as well as their live shows, which mix samples and heavy percussives with Tribal Fusion dance and performance art.

David Satori, born in Burlington, Vermont in 1979, brings experience with many different styles of world music to the collaborative drawing board of Beats Antique. He began playing music while at Burlington High School,[1] and graduated from the California Institute of the Arts with a degree in music performance and composition. While attending CIA, he formed an experimental instrumental group called The Funnies. The Funnies recorded two albums, and toured in an eco-bus that ran entirely on recycled vegetable oil. In 2003, Satori moved to San Francisco to join Aphrodesia, a ten-piece afro-beat group. Aphrodesia toured the U.S. and made a trip to Nigeria and traveled throughout West Africa playing music. The afro-beat group's tour ended in a performance at the New Shrine in Lagos, a venue built by the son of afro-beat composer and player Fela Kuti. His son Femi Kuti also sat in with Aphrodesia, and inspired Satori to produce their 2007 album, Lagos by Bus. In 2004, back in San Francisco, Satori and Zoe Jakes met and began dating.

Zoe Jakes began belly dancing in 2000, but is a lifelong dancer, having 10 years of jazz and ballet dance experience under her belt. Her belly dancing is a blend of traditional belly dance with tango, popping, and Indian dance. She toured with the Yard Dogs Road Show for five years, performed with the Extra Action Marching Band, and has been touring with The Indigo Belly Dance Company for four years. She began touring with Bellydance Superstars in 2005, a dance company produced by Miles Copeland. Jakes and Satori began working with Ableton Live, and this is when she began to experiment with electronic music.

Tommy Cappel met Zoe Jakes when they were both members of Extra Action Marching Band. Satori and Cappel met years ago when Satori brought him in to play drums for a Burning Man decompression party. Cappel grew up in Fairfax, Virginia. The son of two music teachers and the brother of a drummer, Cappel was always surrounded by music. At a young age he took up his brother's drum set, and was playing with a band of friends by the age of six. Influenced by his father's jazz LP's and his brothers prog rock and heavy metal music, Cappel became very interested in percussion. In the 1990s, Cappel attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston for a degree in studio drumming.[2] At Berklee, Cappel studied New Orleans jazz, bebop, modern jazz, and world music. When one of his teachers needed help transcribing African and Arab drum patterns to a drum kit, Cappel helped and learned a lot of non-jazz rhythmic patterns. After graduating, he moved to New York City and began exploring many different types of genres. He would spend a lot of time at the Bell, a café in Manhattan that held free music jams. When a group of friends and musicians moved to San Francisco, Cappel joined them.

French singer Brigitte Fontaine made a series of increasingly strange and eclectic art-pop in the 1970s that gathered a lot of acclaim in France, although she remains obscure to an international audience. Initially she was an eccentric but accessible pop singer, presenting melodic and orchestrated material a la a more daring version of late-'60s/early-'70s Francoise Hardy. On her first album, she worked with arranger Jean Claude Vannier, who had also done arrangements for Serge Gainsbourg. On subsequent records she got jazzier, and then into more difficult directions of avant-gardism and art song. Her albums were commendably wide-ranging, and undeniably erratic. She could employ African tribal rhythms, discordant progressive jazz, pretty folky melodies, throat-stretching a cappella vocals, spoken poetry, and pious classical arrangements, sometimes with a stoned recklessness. On some albums she collaborated with the less impressive male writer and singer Areski, whose rough vocals contrasted incongruously with Fontaine's sweet and mature tone. Fontaine returned to recording in the 1990s, around the time her vintage work slowly began to accumulate a cult following among English-speaking listeners.

Brownout
--------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brownout-mn0000554439[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brownout-mn0000554439+]

The music of Brownout, a hard-hitting eight-piece Latin funk and rock crew, is a direct extension of the melting pot of sounds the bandmembers heard in the American Southwest, from norteño and conjunto through hard rock, blues, and deep funk and R&B. An outgrowth/alter ego project of Grupo Fantasma, their highly original recordings put a creative Latin spin on albums of music by Black Sabbath (Brown Sabbath) and other artists.

Grupo Fantasma guitarists Adrian Quesada and Beto Martinez, bassist Greg Gonzalez, trumpeter Gilbert Elorreaga, saxophonist Josh Levy, trombonist Leo Gauna, drummer Johnny Lopez, and conguero Matthew "Sweet Lou" Holmes were all in an Austin, Texas, funk band called the Blimp. In 2003, shortly before Grupo's Movimiento Popular came out, Quesada suggested starting up a funk outfit with the intention of simply playing covers and having fun. Culling inspiration from groups like Santana, Earth, Wind & Fire, and P-Funk, and calling themselves Brownout, the octet members realized they sounded good enough to release a 7" in 2005 on England's Freestyle Records, a single that ended up doing so well -- and garnering so many follow-up requests -- that soon a 12" was issued as well. This was all enough to convince the friends that Brownout should be a serious thing, and their full-length debut, Homenaje, was released in January 2008. That same year, Brownout won an Austin Music Award for Best Latin Contemporary Band (beating out themselves, as Grupo Fantasma, for the honor) and made appearances at the annual SXSW festival. 

A second album, Aguilas and Cobras, appeared in 2009, with a remix version of the album following in 2010. Oozy arrived in 2012, while an EP featuring funk versions of Black Sabbath tunes, Brownout Presents Brown Sabbath, was released early in 2014 and followed by a second volume two years later. In 2018 the band issued Fear of a Brown Planet. A name-dropping tribute to Public Enemy, whose groundbreaking, influential Fear of a Black Planet was issued in 1990, musically it was an instrumental album that unabashedly looked back to '70s-style, horn-drenched, bass-thumping, wah-wah guitar-wired, uncut funk.

Celibate Rifles
---------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-celibate-rifles-mn0000185064/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-celibate-rifles-mn0000185064/biography+]

Playing stripped-down, loud, and fast Ramones-inspired guitar rock, the Celibate Rifles were one of the earliest Australian punk bands to emerge during the post-Radio Birdman/Saints era. Taking their cues from these Aussie bands, along with the American hard rock of the Stooges, MC5, and Blue Oyster Cult, the Rifles were led by the twin-guitar attack of Kent Steedman and Dave Morris and the deadpan baritone of vocalist Damien Lovelock. They exploded out of the gates in 1982 with a series of records (released in Australia only) fueled by high-speed guitars, wah-wah-strangulated solos, and cartoonish, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. 

Playing initially for crowds of hard rock-loving surfers, it didn't take long for the Rifles to develop a following. Outside of the continent, however, they were virtually unknown. That changed in 1985 with the release of Quintessentially Yours, a lengthy EP that was a collection of tracks from earlier albums. Although the Rifles didn't receive the attention of many lesser American and English bands, the releases kept coming, and they were all excellent. What didn't help was a seeming disinterest the band had in touring America. But when you're an Australian band, it's easy to see why: it's expensive, it takes forever to get there, and why bother when the records aren't getting the kind of reception they deserve? As a result, the Rifles last toured America in 1987. 

As they continued recording and maturing, the Rifles were unafraid to take risks with their tried-and-true loud-and-fast sound. Soon, acoustic guitars entered the mix, tempos slowed, pianos tinkled in the background, and vocal harmonies were added. None of this increased technical skill and studio experimentation diluted the band's strengths (i.e., feral power); in fact, it may well have made the Rifles a better and more interesting band. Another development was the increased politicization and social consciousness of their material. No longer were they simply sarcastic funny boys. Rather, they were addressing serious political, environmental, and social issues, thanks to Lovelock's sharp, insightful lyrics, all without any condescension or simplistic rhetoric. 

In 1989, Rifles albums were suddenly no longer available in American release, a fact that didn't help the band in its quest to develop an international following. As a result, their great album Blind Ear was available (when you could find it) only as a high-priced Aussie import. Also, there were signs that the Rifles were nearing the end: Steedman and Morris were playing around Sydney with other musicians and producing new bands; Lovelock released a solo album (It's a Wig, Wig, Wig, World) with members of the Church; and the time between Rifles releases seemed to grow longer. Another dispiriting sign was the 1992 release of Heaven on a Stick, which, despite a wonderful title, sounded tired and tossed off. 

Fortunately, all this speculation turned out to be wrong, and in late 1994 the Rifles stormed back with Spaceman in a Satin Suit, an exhilarating return to form. A nonstop barrage of power, volume, and sharp songwriting, it shreds virtually every effort by the '90s generation of guitar-based alterna-rock careerists, and is easily the band's best record since Blind Ear. They may be a grizzled bunch of punk rockers, but there's nothing the Celibate Rifles couldn't teach young rock bands."

Clean, The
----------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clean-mn0000073421/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clean-mn0000073421/biography+]

 The Clean were one of the most influential New Zealand bands of the post-punk era. They formed in the town of Dunedin in 1978, when Hamish Kilgour (drums) and his brother David (guitar) recruited David's school friend, guitarist Peter Gutteridge. Soon afterward, they opened for New Zealand punk rockers Enemy.

The Clean were one of the first bands in the country to play original material. They carved out a distinctive noisy but melodic sound, distinguished by David's screeching, distorted guitar. When the Kilgour brothers decided to relocate the band to Auckland in 1979, Gutteridge had already left the lineup. The Clean played with a rotating bassist before David quit the band and moved back to Dunedin. Once he was back home, he was introduced to bassist Robert Scott and the two started playing together; news of his brother's new musical relationship prompted Hamish to move back to Dunedin and begin the Clean again.

In early 1980, the group began playing around town in earnest. In early 1981, a fan named Roger Shepherd began Flying Nun Records to release a single by the Clean, "Tally Ho!" With its jagged guitar, sweet melody, and persistent organ, "Tally Ho!" reached number 19 on the charts.

As they prepared to record their first album, they discovered that the small amount of New Zealand engineers didn't care for the band's material. The Clean didn't fight -- they backed down, deciding to record on a four-track under the guidance of Chris Knox and Doug Hood. In November, the Boodle Boodle Boodle EP was released; it surprised every observer by climbing to number four on the New Zealand charts.

Boodle and the 1982 EP Great Sounds Great captured the quirky sides of the Clean's sound, since they did not have the technology to replicate the band's roaring live sound. Later in 1982, the group released their loudest single yet, "Getting Older." Soon after its release, David Kilgour exited the band, moving back to Dunedin. Robert Scott left after David's departure, forming a band of his own, the Bats. Hamish Kilgour moved to Christchurch -- where Flying Nun Records was located -- and bought his own four-track. After Hamish had begun writing and recording, David came up to Christchurch to help finish up the solo tracks, as well as to record some Clean songs. The resulting music, released under the name the Great Unwashed, was collected on the album Clean Out of Our Minds. The music was a departure from the Clean's punk-injected sound; instead, it was folkier and more acoustic.

To promote the record, the Kilgours reunited with Peter Gutteridge while still using the name the Great Unwashed. On the ensuing tour, the band concentrated on Gutteridge's backlog of material; at the beginning of 1984, they recorded an EP called Singles, which earned quite a bit of airplay and sales. Bassist Ross Humphries was added so David Kilgour and Gutteridge could both play guitar, yet the Great Unwashed wound up breaking up within a year. Hamish Kilgour formed Bailter Space with guitarist Alister Parker, Gutteridge began developing a new band called Snapper, and David stopped playing for a few years. 

The Clean -- the lineup featuring Robert Scott -- reunited in 1988 for two concerts in London; a five-song EP culled from the shows was released a year later. The members of the band were encouraged by the results and decided to embark on a world tour. After the tour ended, the band recorded a new album, which was more straightforward and pop-oriented than their previous material. The record, Vehicle, was released in the spring of 1990 and the band supported its release with a world tour. After the tour's completion, the band split again. David Kilgour went solo, Scott returned to the Bats, and Hamish Kilgour moved to New York and formed the Mad Scene. Like lovers who could never quite say goodbye, the group reunited in 1994 to record a new album. Modern Rock was released in late 1995, followed by Unknown Country in 1996 after which the trio went their separate ways yet again. 
After time spent away working on solo projects and with other bands, the trio got back together in 2000 for a festival in their Dunedin hometown, they stayed together for more shows and a new album Getaway, which was released in 2001 on Merge and featured guests Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley of Yo La Tengo. Two years later, Flying Nun and Merge co-released a career spanning collection titled Anthology. Over the next few years the band kept playing shows, a few of which were documented on limited-edition live albums; 2001's Slush Fund, 2003's Syd’s Pink Wiring System, and 2008's Mashed. The trio ended the decade with a new studio album, 2009's Mister Pop, then spent the next year playing a select set of concerts around the globe. Once back home, they began sessions for a possible new album, but abandoned them after the catastrophic earthquake that hit New Zealand in early 2011. They got back together to tour the next year, playing some shows in the US. They did the same in 2014, and then in early 2015 played two concerts in Australia.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Foot_Orchestra[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Foot_Orchestra+]

Founded by Beth Custer and Richard Marriott, the ensemble got its name from a performance art nightclub called the Club Foot which flourished during the 1980s in the Bayview district of San Francisco. Marriott, who lived upstairs, formed a house band that came to be called the "Club Foot Orchestra." Two albums released on Ralph Records document the music of this period: Wild Beasts and Kidnapped.[2] Richard Marriott still serves as the group's creative and artistic director.

The Club Foot Orchestra performs live with a variety of feature-length and short-subject silent films ranging from German Expressionist to Comedy[3] Their unique compositions often rely on a collaborative writing process that makes their scores both varied and cohesive. This collaborative process is a fundamental element in their unique musical style. They also perform music in other genres, such as choreographer Joe Goode's Maverick Strain performance installation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Blackbird[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Blackbird+]

Eighth Blackbird (stylized as eighth blackbird until April 2016) is an American contemporary music sextet that is based in Chicago, Illinois, United States and composed of flute, clarinet, piano, percussion, violin, and cello (Pierrot ensemble with percussion). Their name derives from the eighth stanza of Wallace Stevens' poem Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.

Eighth Blackbird was originally formed at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, while the members were participating in the school's Contemporary Music Ensemble conducted by Tim Weiss.[2] Weiss is consistently credited by ensemble members as helping to form the ensemble and with encouraging them to memorize and choreograph their shows.[3][4] In 1996, the ensemble won the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, a prestigious award given every year to the United States' best chamber ensembles.[5] Two years later, while the members were studying together at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, success at the Concert Artists Guild competition led to the ensemble's first management contract.[6] Since then, the ensemble has gone on to win many prizes and has routinely been hailed by leading critics as forging a pathway for classical music in the twenty-first century.[7][8][9]

The members of Eighth Blackbird hold degrees in music performance from the United States' leading music schools, including Oberlin Conservatory, the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, the Juilliard School, Northwestern University, and the Curtis Institute of Music. Current players in the group include Yvonne Lam, violin/viola; Nicholas Photinos, cello; Nathalie Joachim, flutes; Michael Maccaferri, clarinets; Lisa Kaplan, piano; and Matthew Duvall, percussion. Four of the group's six members are founding members; Joachim replaced flautist Tim Munro in 2015, who replaced the ensemble's original flautist, Molly Barth, in 2006, and Lam replaced violinist and violist Matt Albert in 2011.

Earth takes a long time to get moving: not just the album as a whole, but individual tracks stir into motion as slowly as a planet shifting on its axis. “Iyaami” opens with five-and-a-half minutes of dry balafon before Dele Sosimi (formerly of Fela Kuti’s Egypt 80 and then of Femi Kuti’s Positive Force, and one of a number of starry guests), over an angular, percussive piano and saxophone groove, starts to intone a lyric about the universality of all mothers, including Mother Earth.

The British-based collective Emanative, led (to the extent that collectives can be led) by the drummer Nick Woodmansey, mix the Space Jazz pioneered by Sun Ra with global influences. “Heaven’s Mirror”, which stars Idris Ackamoor and David Molina of The Pyramids, joins up the lines of force connecting Egypt, Ethiopia and Thailand with Meso-America. Later, “Spice Routes”, with Nat Birchall playing minor-key saxophone maqams, uses spices as a symbol of the cultural trade routes between East and West.

Elsewhere, Eastern spirituality is to the fore. In keeping with Indian Classical music, it opens with a song of the dawn (with, curiously, a welcome in French from Astrobal), and finishes with a dusk raga. Right in the centre of the album — it its midday — is the “Sandhyavandanam”, a recitation of Vedic prayers, here to a combination of flute, sarod and rubab.

The religion is mixed with politics. “Ecosystem (Solar Noon)” is a discordant condemnation of ego and materialism, and “Minutes To Midnight For This Planet”, its title a nod to Sun Ra, sounds a nebulously apocalyptic note. On “Reflection”, to dancing saxophone from Birchall, Liz Elensky recites a series of never-ending opposites starting with “Peace-War” and working up through “Limited-Infinite” and “Straight-Curved” to “Yin-Yang”, “In-Out” — an incantation that unites even as it distinguishes.

In a similar vein, Susso Seki Singh’s Orange Sunshine is one of the first releases on Painted Word, a new label founded by the prolific producer Youth. It combines kora from Jally Kebba Susso, Celtic harp from Andrea Seki and santoor from Kiranpal Singh with occasional electronic effects — the overall effect is a brightly shimmering blur of plucked strings, reminiscent of Laraaji’s blissed-out zither.

Erlend Apneseth (born 11 August 1990) is an award-winning hardingfele player from Jølster in Sogn og Fjordane.

Apneseth studied traditional Norwegian folk music at Ole Bull Academy under the guidance of Håkon Høgemo, and became Norwegian elite fiddler in 2012. He released the album Jølster 2012 with Sigmund Eikås, Synnøve Bjørset, and Gro Marie Svidal the same year. This album was nominated for 'Folkelarmprisen' as best solo album.[1]

He has established himself with a more modern sound, where he is moving in landscapes of more improvised and contemporary music, becoming the basis of timbres from fingerboard and folk music. This has resulted in collaboration with the dance ensemble Carte Blanche and several improvised musical constellations, including folk and jazz based bands. This also led to extensive performing in Norway and abroad, and at the 2016 Nattjazz he performed with his own trio including Stephan Meidell and Øyvind Hegg-Lunde.

Fantastic Negrito

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fantastic-negrito-mn0003373899[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fantastic-negrito-mn0003373899+]

Bay Area-based singer/songwriter Xavier Dphrepaulezz rebooted his career in the 2010s by adopting the name Fantastic Negrito and pioneering a blues, hip-hop, rock, folk, and funk hybrid on his 2016 album, The Last Days of Oakland. This album arrived 11 years after X Factor, an album he released on Interscope under the name Xavier in 1995, but The Last Days of Oakland functioned as a de facto debut, showcasing an inventive, passionate musician who pulled together all the different, sometimes contradictory sounds in 21st century America and played with the past as a way to comment upon the present. 

The son of a Somali-Caribbean immigrant father and a mother from the U.S. South, Dphrepaulezz was born in Massachusetts. He spent his early childhood there, raised in an orthodox Muslim household, then the family moved to Oakland when he was 12 years old. He delved deeply into music, learning several instruments, and started to write songs, developing a funky, soulful hybrid of R&B-rock. A few years passed before he went south to Los Angeles, signing a record contract with Interscope, which issued X Factor in 1995. The album didn't gain much traction and Dphrepaulezz soon found himself embroiled in record label battles, all of which paled when compared to the serious car accident he suffered in 2000. He spent four weeks in a coma, and once he got out of it, he found his hands were damaged considerably. He spent time in intensive rehab, then went back to Oakland in 2008. 

Dphrepaulezz left music behind for family and home, eventually returning to performing after the birth of his son. Newly inspired, he found himself drawn to the blues. He renamed himself Fantastic Negrito and began working as an indie artist. His first big break arrived in 2015, when "Lost in a Crowd" won a Tiny Desk concert competition on NPR, and then the full-length The Last Days of Oakland, his first as Fantastic Negrito, arrived in the summer of 2016. A major breakthrough for Dphrepaulezz, the album was a critical and commercial success, winning a 2017 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. His follow-up, Please Don't Be Dead, took home the equivalent Grammy in 2019, before 2020 brought Have You Lost Your Mind Yet?, his most eclectic and politically motivated album up to that point.

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1955, Hersch began playing classical piano at age four and was dabbling in composing before the age of ten. However, it was while attending Grinnell College in Iowa that he first became interested in jazz. He dropped out of college and spent some time gigging around Cincinnati before enrolling at the New England Conservatory, where he studied with pianist and composer Jaki Byard. After graduating with honors in 1977, Hersch moved to New York City, where he began playing nightly, paying his dues as a sideman. He also made his recording debut during this period, appearing on such albums as Art Farmer's Yama and Billy Harper's Awakening, both in 1979. 

From 1980 to 1986, Hersch taught at the New England Conservatory. He began leading his own trio and working as a sideman with such luminaries as Chris Connor, Joe Henderson, Stan Getz, Toots Thielemans, Eddie Daniels, and others. He made his debut as leader in 1984 with the trio album Horizons, featuring bassist Marc Johnson and drummer Joey Baron. That same year, he joined clarinetist Jane Ira Bloom for As One, the first of many collaborations between the duo. The '80s remained a busy period for the pianist, who recorded extensively with others, and released his own albums, including 1986's Sarabande, 1988's E.T.C., and 1989's Heartsongs.

In 1993, Hersch came out as gay, announcing the information in his hometown during a benefit performance for AIDS Volunteers of Cincinnati. At the same time, he also revealed that he had been receiving treatment for AIDS since his diagnoses with the disease in 1984. From the '90s onward, Hersch has remained a tireless proponent for both gay rights and AIDS research and education. He has produced benefit recordings, performed in numerous charity concerts, and given keynote addresses at international medical conferences.

Gary Clark Jr.
--------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-clark-jr-mn0000989208/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-clark-jr-mn0000989208/biography+]

With his acclaimed debut Blak and Blu, Gary Clark, Jr. emerged at the dawn of the 2010s as the great hope for modern electric blues. He spent the rest of the decade fulfilling that promise, both by continuing the blues-rock tradition and expanding it to encompass contemporary funk, rock, and hip-hop. Initially, Clark played his cards relatively close to the vest, emphasizing the blues heritage of his hometown in Austin, Texas (and earning the endorsement of local legend Jimmie Vaughan). But Clark quickly took risks other contemporary blues guitarists didn't, collaborating with R&B singer Alicia Keys and modern rockers Foo Fighters, while branching out to political protest on the charged 2019 album This Land. 

Born and raised in Austin, Clark first picked up a guitar at the age of 12 and spent his teens playing whatever gig he could get in the Austin area. He eventually met Clifford Antone, promoter and owner of Antone's, the city's premier blues club, who began featuring Clark at his venue. An amazing live performer, Clark soon became one of the brightest players on Austin's blues and rock scene. He released an independent album, 2005's Tribute, followed by a pair of self-produced albums in 2008 for Hotwire Unlimited, 110 and Worry No More. An EP, Gary Clark, Jr., also appeared from Hotwire in 2010. 

But Clark was far from just a one-trick-pony guitar gunslinger. He could also sing, write, and arrange. He wrote the original score for the film Full Count and appeared as an actor in John Sayles' 2007 film Honeydripper. In 2010, Clark was selected by Eric Clapton to perform at the Crossroads Guitar Festival, and a video release of the show featuring Clark led to a recording deal with Warner Bros. Clark was soon in the studio working on his major-label debut. An EP called Bright Lights was released in 2011 in advance of the album, Blak and Blu, which appeared in the fall of 2012. A Top Ten hit, it earned him a Grammy award in the Best Traditional R&B Performance category for "Please Come Home." Clark's next release was the impressive two-disc Live, recorded during an 18-month-long tour behind Blak and Blu; the album better represented his wild, impassioned, and often elegantly graceful live sets. 

After more touring, including dates opening for the Rolling Stones and the Foo Fighters, Clark released his second major-label studio set, 2015's The Story of Sonny Boy Slim. The album debuted at number eight on the Billboard charts and Clark supported it with an extensive tour (documented on the 2017 album Live North America 2016). That same year, he notched his first chart entry with a cover of the Beatles' "Come Together," recorded for the Justice League film soundtrack. 

In 2018, Clark joined the all-star guest lineup on Tom Morello's collaborative project The Atlas Underground, lending vocals and guitar to the track "Where It's at Ain't What It Is." His fifth studio album, This Land, followed in March 2019, reflecting the political landscape of the time through the perspective of a black American living in Texas. It also picked up four Grammy nominations, including for Best Contemporary Blues Album.

Grupo Fantasma
--------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/grupo-fantasma-mn0000652010[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/grupo-fantasma-mn0000652010+]

The Austin-based Grupo Fantasma is a large, Grammy-winning jam band whose sound crisscrosses various Latin forms -- especially cumbia -- with R&B, soul, funk, rock, hip-hop, jazz, folk sounds, and more. Since 2000, they have established a well-deserved global reputation for incendiary live shows and wonderfully eclectic, always-danceable albums. They are one of the first-call bands for major international festivals and venues to secure during planning. They have played and/or headlined stages at SXSW, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and North Sea Jazz Festival (Curacao and Rotterdam), among others, and have toured Kuwait and Iraq to entertain U.S. troops. They have also toured Pakistan and Qatar. While indisputably rooted in Latin grooves, this outfit doesn't travel the usual routes, using DJs and dancehall toasters and many other sonic and aesthetic elements in opening their sound up ever wider with each release. They started recording somewhat sporadically on their own, beginning with a 2002 self-titled and self-released LP which was well-received in Austin and throughout Texas. It eventually drew the attention of Prince, who enlisted them as his backing group for dates in Las Vegas and London, the ALMA Awards on ABC, the Golden Globes, and the CBS Super Bowl Bash. They have also backed artists like Fañia All-Stars' pianist Larry Harlow, Sheila E., Maceo Parker, Ruben Ramos, Spoon, and Los Lobos, to name a few. 2007's self-produced El Existential on Nat Geo Music was the album that broke them internationally; their reputation outside the U.S. became even more pervasive than at home, making them a traveling entity at large. They won a Grammy for El Existential in the Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative category. They hooked up with Los Lobos' keyboardist/saxophonist Steve Berlin to produce 2016's massively acclaimed Problemas. 

Grupo Fantasma formed in 2000 and quickly established a reputation for their high-energy live shows. Fantasma's players were brought together by Austin's bustling music scene, the members finding in each other a hunger and drive to create something truly unique. Drawing influences from genres and styles like cumbia, salsa, old-school funk, reggae, and more, the band built a buzz around its new and inventive style almost immediately. Their debut record, Grupo Fantasma, was released in 2002 and sold over 7,000 units from the stages of their live shows. It was followed two years later by their regional hit record Movimiento Popular. Though offered label support, Grupo Fantasma elected to produce the effort independently, maintaining complete creative control. The record's success put the band on-stage next to acts like Los Lobos, Barbarito Torres, KRS-One, and Buena Vista Social Club. Following two performances on Austin City Limits and an exciting night with Prince at his now defunct Las Vegas venue, the 3121 Club (he showed up to play after the band did a sold-out two-week stint there), Grupo Fantasma released the first record that captured their explosive live performances in 2006's Comes Alive. 

With their fan base and reputation built entirely upon word of mouth, the grassroots success of Grupo Fantasma marks them as one of the decade's most important independent artists in the Latin genre. Released in 2008, the band's worldwide breakthrough album, Sonidos Gold, received widespread attention from all over the world. After tours with Prince and others, as well as headlining clubs and stages across Europe, Asia, and the U.S., Grupo Fantasma entered a studio with producer Steve Berlin in 2013. Though they finished an album, their label at the time, Nat Geo Music, was shut down by its parent company. In the meantime, the band's members released another album with sister group Brownout entitled Brownout Presents: Brown Sabbath. The album was picked up by Ubiquity and the Brownout band -- with Grupo Fantasma -- toured heavily in support of the project for a year-and-a-half. When that tour ended, they circled back to Problemas. They had received several other offers to release it, but none that would give it the proper level of support, so they waited. Eventually, they did receive a good offer from a Japanese label and took it, but it too fell through. Eventually, Houston's Blue Corn Music signaled their interest and enthusiasm for the project, and Grupo Fantasma signed; it was issued in 2016. After a short break and a long tour, the band re-entered the studio with Miami-based Colombian born producer Carlos "El Loco" Bedoya (Beyoncé and Weezer). With his vast experience as an audio engineer, musician, and songwriter, Grupo Fantasma enlisted him as a co-composer on the politically charged single "The Wall," which also included guest spots from Ozomatli and the Grammy-nominated Locos por Juana of Miami. The set was cut at the iconic Ranch Studio in the Texas border town of Tornillo -- it later became the site of an internment facility for thousands of migrant children. Other collaborators included percussionist Sunny Jain of Indian fusion band Red Baraat, vocalist Tomar Williams of Tomar & the FCs, and members of Soul Support. The finished effort was titled American Music, Vol. 7 and released in the early spring of 2019. The set title was a pushback at the "Latin band" tag, as all but one of its members were U.S. born.

Hamell on Trial

https://www.hamellontrial.org/[+https://www.hamellontrial.org/+]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamell_on_Trial[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamell_on_Trial+]

Edward James "Ed" Hamell, performing as Hamell on Trial, is an American punk rock, anti-folk, spoken word musician, described by Righteous Babe Records as "loud, fast music informed by politics, passion, energy and intelligence, played by a guy with a sharp tongue and a wicked sense of humor".

Born in Syracuse, New York, Hamell spent years as a member of many bands before venturing into the realm of the solo singer-songwriter. He finally got his big break when he moved to Austin, Texas and earned a residency at first the Chicago House and then the Electric Lounge.[2]

Since then, he has released a number of albums on various labels, including Mercury Records, his own DiY label Such-A-Punch Media, and Righteous Babe Records, the label started by his longtime supporter and frequent touring companion, Ani Difranco. Ed has a son named Detroit, born in 2002. Detroit performed on Ed's album "The Happiest Man in the World".[3] Hamell was seriously injured in a car accident in May 2000, but recovered from head and spinal injuries to release the album Ed's Not Dead: Hamell Comes Alive the following year. His touring covers the US, Europe, Scandinavia and Australia.

In 2008, with the breakup of his 22-year marriage, Hamell wrote a song a day for a year and posted a video of it on his YouTube channel hamelltv. It is now over 450 songs.

In 2014 Hamell signed to New West Records and released "The Happiest Man in the World". He began production on a one-man show with the same title based on the album and the demise of his marriage to be world premiered at The Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2014.

In 2017, Hamell released his second album for New West Records, "Tackle Box." In August of that year, Hamell streamed a selection of songs performed live at monuments around Washington, DC, in a series collectively called "Hamell Takes DC." 

Hamell addresses poignant and controversial issues, but with a comic edge. Known for rapid and powerful strumming on his heavily amplified 1937 Gibson L-00 acoustic guitar, Hamell's musical styling is as far from traditional folk music as it is from the typical drum-heavy electric guitar ridden sounds of traditional punk music. "Hamell’s signature sound comes from his strumming with maximum aggression, tight to the bridge, which lends a metallic ring to a sustained and percussive low-end rumble," writes Randal Doane, in a profile in Harper's. "Hamell also plays slide guitar lines sweetly drenched with the timbre and phrasing of his musical forebears of the Mississippi Delta. 'I’m a Libra,' he told me last fall, over coffee. 'I need the balance.'”[4]

His sound and composition is comparable to that of the Velvet Underground. Live performances also include extended jokes and comic anecdotes between songs, demonstrating Hamell's respect for the stand-up comedy of Bill Hicks, who is celebrated in the closing tracks of Hamell's album Choochtown.

Having grown up in Vancouver, Canadian artist Hannah Epperson is fast becoming known for her immersive, genre-defying creations. Now, following 2016’s Upsweep, she’s just released the album’s second half – Slowdown.

A collection of just 10 songs, Slowdown includes two contrasting versions of each track. The first half of the album is filled with the ‘Amelia’ – a crystal clear, musically rich offering, whilst the last five tracks are the ‘Iris’ – a stripped back, though just as musically engaging, take on the song. In Epperson’s universe, the names Iris and Amelia represent two fictional characters whose opposing worlds come together to form the likewise fictional character of a narcissistic and alienated young man with a severe and (potentially) life-threatening obsession. Iris and Amelia stand in clear contrast with each other. The lyrics transport that oscillation between the two characters and merge the real and the surreal, the finite and the infinite.

From the cinematic alt-pop sounds of the likes of ‘20/20’, in which we’re lured into Epperson’s creations with whirring strings and pulsating beats, to the haunting undertones and stirring emotion of ‘We Will Host A Party’, each track offers something entirely unique. As the glitchy and immersive soundscapes of ‘Cat’s Cradle’ and ‘Tell The Kids It’s Gonna Be Alright’ float into your ears, an hypnotic aura will cast you under Epperson’s spell on first listen, whilst the more traditional folk-inspired melodies and emotion-strewn whimsical vocals of ‘40 Numbers’ are a sheer sonic delight.

Whether it’s the sparkling pop of the Amelia or the exquisite simplicity of the Iris, each exquisite track on Slowdown offers a rich, majestic cacophony, sure to captivate in an instant.

Harry Manx (born 1955) is a Canadian musician who blends blues, folk music, and Hindustani classical music. His official website describes his music as being a "blend Indian folk melodies with slide guitar blues, add a sprinkle of gospel and some compelling grooves and you'll get Manx's unique "mysticssippi" flavour."[1] Manx plays the slide guitar, harmonica, six-string banjo, mohan veena and Ellis stomp box. He studied for five years in India with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. Bhatt is the inventor of the 20-stringed mohan veena, which has become Manx's signature instrument.[2] He has released twelve albums in twelve years, and has his own record label Dog My Cats Records.[2] He has received much recognition and many awards, including: seven Maple Blues Awards, six Juno nominations, the Canadian Folk Music Award in 2005 for Best Solo Artist, and CBC Radio’s "Great Canadian Blues Award" in 2007.

Multi-instrumentalist and composer Harry Manx has been described as an essential link between the music of the East and the music of the West. He fuses traditional blues with classic Indian ragas to create a distinctive sound.

Manx, primarily a guitarist who also plays harmonica and banjo, was born on the Isle of Mann and moved with his family to Canada. He left home in his teens to live in Europe, Japan, India, and Brazil, carefully perfecting his compelling live show on the streets and in cafes and bars before later breaking out to music festivals. Blues music capture his attention when he was still in his teens and he did some roadie work for Willie Dixon, John Hammond, and others. He hit the road hard in Europe, booking himself wherever and whenever he could, as a solo act playing banjo, harmonica and guitar.

He moved to Japan and spent the latter half of the '80s performing there. In Japan, he discovered the music of Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and left Japan for India. In 1992, he introduced himself to Bhatt and spent the next five years under his tutelage, learning to play Bhatt's creation, the 20-string Mohan veena. The high point of his time as Bhatt's apprentice was performing with him at a concert for several thousand people at the Taj Mahal. At that time, Bhatt was well known in India, but several years later, he'd be discovered by some American audiences with his 1994 Grammy Award-winning recording with Ry Cooder, "Meeting by the River." The only other musician to have mastered the complex Mohan veena was the late Beatle George Harrison. 

Although based in Canada for years, he traveled from India to his wife's home country, Brazil, and played his unique blend of American and Indian "blues" music in the bars and cafes around Sao Paulo. He returned to Canada in 2000 and quickly recorded a demo, which became his debut album for Northern Blues Music, Dog My Cat. After hearing Manx perform at a conference of the North American Folk Music and Dance Alliance, executives at Northern Blues Music signed him. 

Manx's debut album was immediately recognized by the cognoscenti in Toronto's blues scene, and he was nominated for two Maple Blues Awards, for Best Acoustic Act and Best Recording in 2001. Manx quickly followed up with his 2002 release for Northern Blues Music, Wise and Otherwise, which he recorded in the space of a day. Manx's sophomore effort won a Canadian Independent Music Award for "Blues Album of the Year" and drew him critical praise, his stylings were compared with those of Kelly Joe Phelps and Ry Cooder. In 2003, he released Jubilee -- again on Northern Blues Music -- a collaboration with sought-after recording session maven Kevin Breit. 

Since 2001, Manx, an engaging musician and vocalist, has released Road Ragas (2003), West Eats Meet on his own label in 2004, and Mantras for Madmen in 2005. In the spring of 2007, he released In Good We Trust, another excellent collaboration with Kevin Breit, on the highly regarded Stony Plain Records. Over the next decade, he released material steadily -- usually solo affairs, but he reunited with Breit in 2011 for Strictly Whatever and collaborated with the Sydney Lyric Quartet for 2017's Faith Lift.

Headless Chickens
-----------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/headless-chickens-mn0001835365/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/headless-chickens-mn0001835365/biography+]

One of the first New Zealand bands to explore the world of "abused technology" -- samplers, synthesizers, drum machines, and the like -- the Headless Chickens formed in 1985 as a one-off project to play the multimedia event "Nitpickers Picnic." Originally dubbed the International Headless Chickens, the trio -- onetime Children's Hour members Chris Matthews and Johnny Pierce, along with drummer Michael Lawry -- re-formed on a permanent basis in 1986, and soon made their recorded debut with a track on the student radio compilation Outnumbered by Sheep. A self-titled EP followed later that year, and the group began a tour in support of Nico.

Tragedy soon struck, however, when bassist Pierce committed suicide in August 1986. The Headless Chickens soldiered on, enlisting another Children's Hour alum, Grant Fell, as Pierce's replacement; with the addition of former Bird Nest Roys member Rupert Taylor, they became a quartet. In 1987, the Headless Chickens won a national rock music contest which resulted in a first prize award of $60,000, allowing them to record an LP and mount a national tour; ex-Children's Hour drummer Bevan Sweeney then signed on to cut Stunt Clown, issued in 1988 to strong critical acclaim. The single "Donka" was also an audience favorite. The following year, the Headless Chickens' roster changed yet again with the addition of multi-instrumentalist Anthony Nevison, who made his debut on the excellent single "Expecting to Fly," which helped land a contract with the Flying Nun label. 

Still, because of their heavy reliance on electronics -- a sound atypical of the dominant New Zealand aesthetic -- the Headless Chickens initially found little mainstream acceptance. That changed with the release of 1991's Body Blow, the first record to feature new vocalist Fiona McDonald; the single "Cruise Control," which marked a new, slicker direction for the group's sound, reached the Top Ten -- only the second Flying Nun release to earn such a distinction. The follow-up singles, "Donde Esta La Pollo" and "Juice," were also successful. Health problems forced Nevison temporarily out of the group in 1993, and after a 1994 European tour, both McDonald and Lawry exited as well; when Fell announced his own departure in early 1995, the group's continued existence appeared grim, but in 1997, they returned with Greedy. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_Chickens[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_Chickens+]

The Headless Chickens was a New Zealand band. Going against the grain of the Dunedin sound that dominated the Flying Nun Records roster at the time, the Headless Chickens made extensive use of electronic instruments in their music. 

The Headless Chickens recorded three albums, Stunt Clown (1988), Body Blow (1991), and Greedy (1997), plus various EPs for Flying Nun Records in the 1980s and 1990s.

The band first became known in New Zealand when they won the 1987 Rheineck Beer Rock award. The prize money from the award went into the funding for their innovative (for its use of sampling) 1988 debut album Stunt Clown.

The 1988 CD release of Stunt Clown compiled the vinyl release of this name with the 1986 Headless Chickens EP.

A second album, Body Blow, appeared in 1991 which featured singer Fiona McDonald. It was during this time with McDonald that the Headless Chickens would attract their widest audience. Two versions of Body Blow were released, with the revised and expanded 1993 version going double platinum in New Zealand.

This album spawned the single "Cruise Control" which became a hit in New Zealand and (in a remixed form) Australia. "Cruise Control" was notable for its sampling, particularly for elements of Shona Laing's 1973 single "1905" and The Crocodiles' 1980 single "Tears".

At the time, the band's use of electronic elements and sampling in a "rock" setting was out of the ordinary and had an influence on many other N.Z. bands that followed them.

The follow-up 1997 Greedy album took several years to complete, and during that time several band members left, including singer McDonald. Greedy contained the track "George" which became a No. 1 hit single in their home country; "George" was the first (and so far, only) track from the Flying Nun Records label to achieve No. 1 status.

The Headless Chickens split up soon after the release of Greedy.

In 2002 Flying Nun Records released a 2CD best-of compilation named ChickensHits.

In July 2008 it was announced that the band would reform to play the Homebake Festival in Sydney, Australia on 6 December. The line-up would feature both Chris Matthews and Fiona McDonald.[1] They played further concerts in Australia and New Zealand and were scheduled to play at the Auckland Big Day Out in January 2009.[2]

On 27 January 2018, bassist Grant Fell died of cancer at the age of 56.

Hildegard Lernt Fliegen

Is it a one-man band, an orchestra, a sextet or a travelling circus? It is difficult to say. Hildegard Lernt Fliegen (Hildegard learns to fly) is a very special and, perhaps, one of the most creative music projects Switzerland has to offer. It is jazz, but also noise art, a musical cabaret, rock, rap and morbid polka with a little Kurt Weill and Frank Zappa aftertaste.

These fellows can be comical, noisy and whimsical, but never boring. Their music is brimming with wit and imagination.

The group was formed in 2005 by Andreas Schaerer, then brought ashore in 2007, when they released their first album. The reviews were glowing, sales were brisk, and the album had to be re-released after being sold out in a couple of months. The sextet won the most important newcomer prize in Switzerland, the so-called ZKB Jazzpreis in 2008. In 2011, they received a grant from Pro Helvetia for the priority promotion of jazz music, which is the most important jazz award in Switzerland. In 2014 they entered the finale of the BMW-Wrold Jazz Award.

The group’s leader humorously calls Hildegard Lernt Fliegen a flying object, which gets above the firmament, sometimes very high, taking the audience together.  The group has travelled from Russia to China and all over Europe. Their tour in Russia in 2010 was captured on a film and recorded on CD.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iguanas_(band)[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iguanas_(band)+]

The Iguanas is a roots rock band from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, formed in 1989. Their sound has been described as combining Chicano rock, R&B, Conjunto and various Latin styles into a deep groove.

The song "Boom, Boom, Boom", from their 1994 album Nuevo Boogaloo, was featured in the Homicide: Life on the Street episode "The Documentary".[1] Nuevo Boogaloo hit #34 on the US Billboard Heatseekers chart in 1994.[2] The song "Para Donde Vas" from their 1993 self-titled debut album was included on the soundtrack of the 1996 film Phenomenon. The group also appeared in Robert Mugge's 2006 documentary New Orleans Music in Exile, in which they talked about how Hurricane Katrina affected them.[3] The band released a studio album titled Sin To Sin on PFAM in April, 2012.

New Orleans, Louisiana's Iguanas reflected the diversity of musical styles found in their home state by fusing blues, Latin, classic R&B, zydeco, Cajun, Tex-Mex, and roots rock & roll. The group formed in 1989 around vocalist and guitarist Rod Hodges, who began playing guitar in San Francisco Bay Area blues and rock bands at age 14. While playing with a blues band in Colorado, he rediscovered the conjunto music that was a part of his mother's Mexican heritage, and inspired by master accordionist Flaco Jiménez, he took up the accordion as well. Vocalist and saxophonist Joe Cabral was raised in Nebraska, and his first musical experience came as part of his father's Mexican band. In college in Montana, he discovered Chicago blues, New Orleans R&B, and a honking saxophone style. Bassist Rene Coman was a native of New Orleans whose recording credits include Alex Chilton, Guitar Slim, Jr., and Willy DeVille, while saxophonist Derek Huston and drummer Willie Panker rounded out their original lineup. 

The Iguanas recorded their self-titled 1993 debut -- a pastiche of New Orleans funk ("Late at Night"), Latin music ("Para Donde Vas"), and Mexican polka ("Take Your Pictures, Your Letters and Your Ring") -- for Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville label. By the band's second release, Nuevo Boogaloo in 1994, Panker had been replaced on drums by Doug Garrison. According to Garrison, he first worked with Rene Coman in the Alex Chilton band in the mid-'80s, where they developed strong musical bonds. They have also recorded together with Tav Falco's Panther Burns, and Garrison appears on Charlie Rich's last recording, the jazz-influenced Pictures and Paintings. In 1996 the band recorded its final disc for the Margaritaville label, Super Ball, which included a guest spot from guitarist and Iguanas fan Dave Alvin. Following the release of 1999's Sugar Town for the Koch label, the Iguanas signed with Yep Roc, reunited with producer Justin Niebank, and released Plastic Silver 9-Volt Heart in 2003. Scattered for a time in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Iguanas reconvened with Niebank and Yep Roc in 2008 for the relatively (and understandably) subdued If You Should Ever Fall on Hard Times. Playing the Crescent City weekly and the American Southeast festival circuit, the band didn't record again for another four years, issuing the more characteristically upbeat and celebratory, Latin-infused rock date Sin to Sin in 2012 on Piety Street. Before the Piety Street studio closed, the band went all the way back to their roots for their Latin garage rock date Juarez in 2014, recorded with Mark Bingham. The Iguanas regularly appear at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and have issued a handful of albums recorded at the annual event, including Live at Jazzfest 2016 and Live at New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival 2019.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaga_Jazzist[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaga_Jazzist+]

Jaga Jazzist (also known as Jaga) is a Norwegian experimental jazz band, that rose to prominence when the BBC named their second album, A Livingroom Hush (Smalltown Supersound/Ninja Tune), the best jazz album of 2002.

The core of the band are the brothers and the main songwriters, Lars and Martin Horntveth. Martin formed Jaga Jazzist together with Ivar Christian Johansen in 1994 while they still were in their teens, though Johansen later left the group. The brothers are also prominent figures of the Norwegian pop act The National Bank.

Jaga Jazzist nearly created a sensation with their debut album Jævla Jazzist Grete Stitz (1996), that contained playful, humorous jazz with elements of rap. The EP Magazine (1998) showed signs of the catchy, cinematic approach to jazz music they later become known for. The very young Lars Horntveth became increasingly involved in composing the music they played.[1]

After Magazine word spread about their fresh musical expressions and energetic live shows, and the band toured extensively before they signed a recording contract with Warner Music of Norway in 2000. The highly anticipated debut album for Warner, A Livingroom Hush, was released in 2001 and consists of a melodic and energetic mix of lounge jazz, cinematic themes and instrumental rock. The producer Jørgen "Sir Duper Man" Træen played an important role during the recording, and left his mark on the disc with his crackling electronics. A Livingroom Hush won the Norwegian music award Alarm Prize in 2002 and the same year was named Jazz Album of the Year by BBC listeners.

The band features trumpets, trombone, electric guitar, bass, drums, tuba, bass clarinets, Fender Rhodes, vibraphone and a rack of electronics, as well as strong melodies and rhythms. Talk Talk, Soft Machine, John Coltrane, Don Cherry, Aphex Twin, Stereolab, Squarepusher and Tortoise are frequently mentioned as sources of inspiration. Jaga Jazzist is widely considered to be one of the premier acts of the so-called nu-jazz movement of Scandinavia. Also, The Mars Volta cite Jaga Jazzist as one of their favourite bands.[4] Jaga Jazzist's studio album, One-Armed Bandit, was released on January 25, 2010 on Ninja Tune.[5]

In May 2013, Jaga Jazzist collaborated with the Britten Sinfonia to release Live with Britten Sinfonia on Ninja Tune, to a positive critical reception. All About Jazz's John Kelman wrote of the album:

"That Live with Britten Sinfonia was an album not necessarily intended to happen at the time of the recording only makes its release all the sweeter. This 35-piece marriage of Jaga Jazzist and Britten Sinfonia is capable of everything from earth-shattering power to refined beauty. With Britten conducted by the world-renowned Christian Eggen, Live with Britten Sinfonia is the vital document of an opportunity that no longer need feel missed by so many Jaga fans around the world—an album that, transcending their already significant accomplishments, demonstrates even greater potential for Lars Horntveth's writing and Jaga Jazzist's effortless (and faultless) performances."

With her beguiling, airy voice and robust blend of cosmic jazz, R&B, folk, and classical, singer/songwriter Kadhja Bonet quietly made waves in the Los Angeles underground prior to releasing the mini-album The Visitor (2016) and full-length Childqueen (2018). A multi-instrumentalist with a background in classical violin dating back to childhood, Bonet seriously pursued music as an adult following an unfulfilling period in film school. She began collaborating with L.A. producer Itai Shapira, resulting in her soulful debut single "Tears for Lamont" in 2014. Later that year Bonet participated in the Red Bull Music Academy program in Tokyo, working with German producer RJ and Australian producer Max Maxwell on the electronic-laced single "Late Night Munchies." Throughout early 2015, she continued to release singles via her Bandcamp page, each one expanding her range and developing her elegant, occasionally cinematic sound. In September of that year, Bonet delivered her first collection of music, The Visitor, a mini-album released through Fresh Selects and Fat Possum. Less than two years later, she followed it up with the full-length Childqueen, an even more transportive and mystical set of songs for which she provided most of the instrumentation.

L'Ensemble Raye
---------------

http://www.ensembleraye.ch/[+http://www.ensembleraye.ch/+]

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lensemble-ray%C3%A9-mn0001945790/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lensemble-ray%C3%A9-mn0001945790/biography+]

L'Ensemble Rayé is a quirky and generally lighthearted band with roots in the European avant-prog scene of the '70s and '80s, which included such groups as Henry Cow, Samla Mammas Manna, and Picchio Dal Pozzo. Switzerland's principal contribution to this innovative scene was the band Débile Menthol, formed in 1979 and varying in size from seven to nine members. Featuring a wide array of instrumentation, including violin, reeds, keyboards, guitar, bass, and drums, Débile Menthol mixed post-punk and new wave energy with Rock in Opposition elements to create adventurous and virtuosic music that was nevertheless much lighter in tone than such RIO mainstays as Univers Zero and Art Zoyd. Two important members of the band were Jean-Vincent Huguenin (aka Jean 20 Huguenin) and Cédric Vuille, who would continue a musical partnership long after Débile Menthol came to an end in 1985. The two musicians decided to form L'Ensemble Rayé in 1987, and the debut L'Ensemble Rayé disc, Même en Hiver/Comme un Pinson Dans L'Eau, was first released on vinyl in 1990, with each side of the disc devoted to compositions and arrangements by one of the pair (the "Même en Hiver" side featured Vuille and the "Comme un Pinson Dans L'Eau" side featured Huguenin). The album provided the two musicians the opportunity to display their skills on a wide array of instruments, with Huguenin revealing particular talents on guitar and Vuille on both guitar and clarinet; multi-tracking and a host of guest musicians gave L'Ensemble Rayé the sound of a full band on most of the tracks. The debut CD's style and approach were continued on the second L'Ensemble Rayé disc, 1993's Quelques Pièces Détachées, with Huguenin and Vuille again composing most of the concise, RIO-flavored avant-rock and European folk-jazz tunes, and a diverse cast of musical supporting characters assisting on bass, drums, hurdy-gurdy, keyboards, saxophones, and more. Saxophonist/clarinetist Pierre Kaufmann made some particularly strong contributions to the album and henceforth would be considered a permanent member of the band. 

The next L'Ensemble Rayé CD, En Frac!, was released in 1996 and marked a departure from the previous albums: it is truly a "band" recording -- made live in the studio by a quintet version of the group. The band then consisted of Huguenin, Vuille, Kaufmann, and two new permanent members, Canadian Shirley Anne Hofmann mainly on an array of instruments from the brass family (including euphonium, trombone, and tuba) and fellow Swiss Momo Rossel, like Huguenin and Vuille a former member of Débile Menthol. Rossel, a bassist, guitarist, and accordionist, had formerly led the avant-prog band Nimal, of which Huguenin had been a member and to which Vuille, Kaufmann, and Hofmann had all contributed as guest musicians. The alternatingly sprightly and moody album of European folk-influenced avant-rock and jazz was perhaps L'Ensemble Rayé's strongest display of composing, arranging, and instrumental virtuosity yet, proving that multi-tracking and other studio techniques were not necessary for the group to produce phenomenal music. 

There has often been a charming, whimsical, and innocent quality to the primarily drummer-less sound of L'Ensemble Rayé (a light approach that is relatively unique among bands with an avant-garde sensibility and invites comparison to groups like the Penguin Cafe Orchestra and Phillip Johnston's Transparent Quartet), so it wasn't entirely surprising that the next CD was a child-friendly endeavor with a Winnie the Pooh theme. Ein Fest für Pu den Bären was the seventh disc in a series of Pooh recordings on the Kein & Aber label, and featured the five L'Ensemble Rayé members from En Frac! While the sound of Ein Fest für Pu den Bären is similar in many respects to En Frac! -- and of broad appeal to both adults and children -- the CD actually heralds a return to the approach of the first two L'Ensemble Rayé discs, with a considerable amount of overdubbing and many guest musicians supplementing the core group. In fact, Rossel and Hofmann would soon leave the band, to be replaced by two of the guests who appeared on Ein Fest für Pu den Bären, Yann Altermath and Julien Baillod. With Huguenin, Vuille, and Kaufmann joined by Altermath (on alto saxophone, alto horn, and percussion) and Baillod (on guitar and bass), the band returned to a quintet format for its fifth album, 2001's Vis-à-Vis Movers, which consisted of music commissioned by the MOVERS dance company and premiered at a live dance performance in Zurich during March 2001. Maintaining the high-quality musicianship of the preceding four L'Ensemble Rayé discs, Vis-à-Vis Movers also saw the band branching out into new stylistic areas, even a flirtation with spacy, rhythmic electronica. While a truckload of musicians have contributed to L'Ensemble Rayé discs over the years, the partnership of Jean 20 Huguenin and Cédric Vuille has remained important to the group's sound on all of its recordings to date. When one considers that these two artists began collaborating before the end of the '70s in Débile Menthol, their long-term musical relationship seems all the more remarkable.

Lila Downs
----------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lila-downs-mn0000280993[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lila-downs-mn0000280993+]

Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Lila Downs is among the most globally popular singers of Latin music. One reason is that despite long established roots in Mexico and the United States, her cultural vision is anthropological. Hers is informed by ancient and earthy cultures both from her native Oaxaca -- boleros, rancheras, and mariachis -- and U.S. with its jazz, blues, and soul standards. Her own songwriting topics reflect themes of political and social justice, immigration, transformation, and environmentalism, all rooted in the human condition. Possessed of a big, throaty alto, her performances are dramatic contrasts in cultures as they seek connections between them and highlight the necessity of difference among them, whether she's singing jazz ballads, bouncy norteños, or blues. She has performed everywhere from the White House and Carnegie Hall to Mexico City's Auditorio Nacional, Bueños Aires' Teatro Gran Rex, and Harlem’s Apollo Theater. She is capable of delivering jazz ballads, mournful rancheras, and bouncy norteño dance music, show tunes, and blues with passion and pathos as well as humor and warmth. 2000's Tree of Life offered lyrics derived from the religious codices of the Mixteca and Zapotec people. The album was recorded in Oaxaca. In 2002, the singer appeared in the film Frida and contributed to its soundtrack with the song "Burn It Blue" that was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song. It expanded her fan base globally, allowing her to take more chances, as she did on 2004's Una Sangre (One Blood), where she succeeded in organizing a complicated network of global influences into a distinctive whole rooted in Mexican music. 2011's Pecados y Milagros was another global hit and won both a Grammy and Latin Grammy; it peaked in the top spot on the Latin Albums chart. 2015's Balas y Chocolate featured collaborations with Juan Gabriel and Juanes, and fueled a world tour that took her across Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Two years later, she celebrated themes of female empowerment, activism, and militancy on Salón, Lágrimas y Deseo. 

 Downs grew up with the culture of her father, a professor from the United States, but eventually turned her back on it to explore the tradition of her mother, a Mixteca Indian from Mexico. In doing so, she has created a very individual strain of song that has indigenous Mexican roots and North American sonorities. Born in 1968, she spent her early years in Mexico, but after her parents split up, she was shuffled off to live with a relative in California. She grew to love music, specifically classical and opera, and began studying those in college. After two years, however, she experienced a crisis, questioning why she was singing and dropping out to become a Deadhead, following the Grateful Dead around the country in a VW bus, earning money from making and selling jewelry, and not singing at all.

Although not particularly moved by the Dead's music, she enjoyed the lifestyle for a short time before heading back to college in Minnesota, where her father lived. When she finally graduated, it was with a double degree in anthropology and voice, and a renewed enthusiasm for both her Mexican heritage and singing. Settling in her mother's hometown of Oaxaca, she began vocalizing again and exploring her roots, while realizing that she was still half Yankee. She met up with Philadelphia-based jazz pianist Paul Cohen, and the pair began a professional and personal relationship whose first fruit was the self-released, cassette-only Ofrenda in 1994. That was followed two years later by another cassette, the live Azuláo: En Vivo con Lida Downs -- one of its songs won Best Original Latin Jazz Composition in a Philadelphia poll. 

Along with jazz, Downs was slowly developing a more intense, folkloric style that began to rear its head on 1997's La Sandunga (released in the U.S. on BMG in 1999), whose title track and "La Llorana" offered a hearty passion not to be heard on her jazzier efforts. That vocal promise was fulfilled in 2000 with the release of Tree of Life, the lyrics of which were largely derived from the religious codices of the Mixteca and Zapotec people. The album was recorded in Oaxaca, where Downs and Cohen were sustained by a foundation grant, although their home base remained Mexico City. Tree of Life was also her first recording for the Narada label, where she would remain for eight years. The next year, Downs issued Border (La Linea). In 2004 Una Sangre (One Blood) was released, followed by 2006's La Cantina, whose song "La Cumbia del Mole" presented the singer with the opportunity to make her first-ever music video. 

Downs and her band released her final album for the Narada imprint, Ojo de Culebra, in 2008, and followed it up with En Paris: Live à FIP on World Village in 2010. 

Her seventh studio album, Pecados y Milagros, arrived a year later and won both Grammy and Latin Grammy awards. Canciones Pa' Todo el Año was released in 2012. The same year she performed at the 75th Annual Academy Awards. Downs' next release was Raiz, a 2014 collaborative album with Argentinian singer Niña Pastori and Spanish flamenco vocalist Soledad Pastorutti. The album received two Latin Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Folk Album. 

In late March of 2015, Downs issued "La Patria Modina," a duet with Juanes, as a pre-release single. Its video showcased the impact of the drug war and environmental devastation caused by the policies of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the rampant consumerism that created a widening rift among the economic classes in her native land. She followed it a week later with the release of Balas y Chocolate, a collection of originals and covers that articulated and extrapolated on these themes in folk ballads and party songs, and also juxtaposed modern Mexico with its history. Upon release it was certified gold, was featured on several publications' year-end lists, and won a Latin Grammy for Best Folk Album. 

After touring the globe, Downs, who had been writing while touring, began crafting a record that used banda to launch into ranchera, bolero, blues, and soul. She wrote six new songs, including "Peligrosa," a manifesto and anthem for those she sainted as "dangerous women." She also reinterpreted seven classics; some were traditional songs and others were by legendary composers including Augustin Lara, Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and Alvaro Carillo. The recording sessions yielded duets with friends Mon Laferte, Carla Morrison, Diego el Cigala, and Andres Calamaro. The finished album, Salon Lágrimas y Deseo, was issued in the spring of 2017; it also won a Latin Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal album. Two years later she dropped Al Chile, an anthropological and sociological celebration of the chili pepper and its role in Latin culture. The set was produced by Camilo Lara (Mexican Institute of Sound) and mixed by Mario Caldato, Jr. (Beastie Boys). Its first single was a cover of the Peruvian cumbia classic "Carinito" originally written by Ángel Aníbal Rosado. It was recorded with the La Sonora Tropicana orchestra and La Banda Misteriosa de Oaxaca.

Loren Connors
-------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/loren-connors-mn0000281631[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/loren-connors-mn0000281631+]

The eclectic music of improvisational guitarist Loren Connors is difficult to describe neatly and concisely, but avant-garde is the best generalization. Experimental, jazz, and blues also fit, and even hints of Irish music are evident. Connors -- who names abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko as his single biggest artistic influence -- is incredibly prolific; he released approximately 30 albums between 1978 and the end of the millennium -- many in extremely limited quantities -- on countless labels under his own name and a handful of pseudonyms (including Loren Mazzacane and Guitar Roberts). His wife, Suzanne Langille, occasionally sings on his recordings. Connors' obscure albums met with indifference until the early '90s when critics began to take notice, and supporters such as Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo, Gastr del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and Alan Licht (who has recorded with Connors, Run On, Love Child, and Blue Humans) sang his praises.

As a child, he studied violin (which he credits with shaping his vibrato technique on the guitar) and trombone. He also learned rock & roll bass guitar. Connors was heavily influenced by his mother's singing as well. She often performed Johann Sebastian Bach pieces at funerals. This exposure to classical music led Connors to investigate the music of Giacomo Puccini and Frederic Chopin. Blues, particularly the works of Robert Pete Williams and Muddy Waters, also appealed to him. He studied art at Southern Connecticut University and the University of Cincinnati in the early '70s, but he decided his music was more original than his painting. By 1976, he'd moved back to Connecticut. Two years later, Connors began issuing albums on his own Daggett label. Between 1978 and 1980, he released eight albums of solo acoustic guitar improvisations. Just 75 to 100 copies of each were pressed and sent out to radio stations, and Connors himself doesn't even have them all! (These albums were scheduled for re-release in 1998 as a four-CD set thanks to writer and Father Yod Records founder Byron Coley, a longtime Connors fan.) 

Between 1984 and 1989, Connors was largely inactive musically. He married Langille and they started a family. He dabbled in writing during this period and he won a haiku award in Japan. He moved to New York City in 1990, and a year later he began releasing albums on labels other than his own. After Connors learned he had Parkinson's disease in 1992, he changed the direction of his music. His early work often consisted of short acoustic guitar pieces, but once the disease was discovered, he experimented with longer electric guitar works complete with feedback and distortion. Much of Connors' late-'90s output was released on Road Cone Records, a small label based in Portland, Oregon. The release of The Lost Mariner, Connors' collaboration with bassist Darin Gray, was released in 1999. The Daggett Years, a compilation culled from the Unaccompanied Acoustic Guitar Improvisations, Vols. 1-9, 1979-1980, and Portrait of a Soul, followed in mid-2000. Little Match Girl was issued the following year along with a second collaboration with Gray entitled This Past Spring. Connors' solo studio meditation on September 11, 2001, The Departing of a Dream on Family Vineyard, saw its first volume released in 2002. That same year, the double-disc compilation Airs 1992-2001 was released as a limited CD-R. Departing of a Dream saw two more volumes released by Family Vineyard in 2003 and 2004, respectively (the latter was his last studio offering of new material for seven years). In France, with guitarist Alan Licht, was issued in 2003, as was the unique collaborative recording Arborvitae, with former Gastr del Sol guitarist David Grubbs. Connors. He continued to release titles on numerous labels -- live or archival material -- and became ever more closely affiliated with Family Vineyard, who have taken great care with his catalog, as evidenced by their releases of As Roses Bow: Collected Airs 1992-2002, and Night Through: Singles and Collected Works 1976-2004, Two Nice Catholic Boys (with Jim O'Rourke), Curse of Midnight Mary, Into the Night Sky, and Hymn of the North Star; the label has kept fans aware of the various reissues and new live projects. Connors has released more than 50 recordings since 1976, the bulk of which were in the '90s and early 21st century. The guitarist finally returned to the studio for Family Vineyard and released Red Mars, a five-piece suite, in September of 2011 -- five days before the tenth anniversary of September 11, 2001. It was followed by the one-sided LP Fire. 

In 2012, he and Langille re-teamed on record for the time in 15 years on I Wish I Didn't Dream, an album of live improvisations based on the work of artist M P Landis. It was followed the next year by The Only Way to Go Is Straight Through by Connors and Thurston Moore. 2015 saw the Family Vineyard reissue of one of Connors' most cherished albums, 1990's Blues: The "Dark Paintings" of Mark Rothko, as well as Live in New York, captured the previous year during two performances held six days apart. Between April and August of 2016, Connors issued a series of singles, EPs, and collaborative recordings through the label which included an untitled live performance with Tom Carter, Departing of a Dream, Vol. 5 and Vol. 6, and Light with Clint Heidorn. In the fall of 2017, two radically different Connors recordings appeared from Family Vineyard: In October, the 17-plus-minute lone track Angels That Fall, an extended electric guitar and piano improvisation, and in December, Robert Crotty with Me: Loren's Collection (1979-1987). The latter recording is comprised of unheard material, unseen photos, and liner notes by Connors and Crotty’s brother, as well as a bonus disc -- the first reissue of Crotty’s lone, ultra-rare Robert Crotty Blues and his "Prove It!" single -- both originally released on Connors’ private St. Joan label in the late 1980s.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rubin_(musician)[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rubin_(musician)+]

Mark Rubin is an American multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer of music for television and motion pictures, published critic, educator. Founder of proto-Americana acts Killbilly in Dallas TX in 1989 and Bad Livers, Austin TX, in 1990, Rubin is best known as a bassist and tuba player. Today he lives and works in the musical community of South Louisiana based in New Orleans and tours frequently performing his own original material as "Jew of Oklahoma".

Rubin was a founding member of "Killbilly", a Dallas, Texas-based band active from 1987 to 1994, which described its music as being a mixture of bluegrass and punk. Critics[who?] have variously described the band's style as a "fusion of bluegrass and shred metal", and as "a genuine bluegrass band playing straight, fast and loud". It was in Killbilly that Rubin first met banjoist Danny Barnes who encouraged his playing and suggested he leave for Austin. Rubin left the band, and Dallas, to move to Austin and play with Barnes in 1989, eventually forming "Bad Livers" in 1990. 

Since 1996, Rubin has been a driving force in the "klezmer" music world as a bassist, tuba player, instructor and pedagogue. His credits in the Jewish music world include long time collaborations with Frank London’s Klezmer Brass All-Stars, The Other Europeans, and Andy Statman, as well as two decades on faculty at KlezKamp. He has been featured performer and instructor with multiple appearances at Toronto's Ashkenaz Festival, Yiddish Summer Weimar, KlezFest London, KlezMore Wein, Klezmer Festival Furth, Festival of Jewish Culture Krakow among others. His Jew of Oklahoma show debuted as a special feature at Ashkenaz in 2016. For three summers in the mid 2000s he toured with the Serbian Romani Brass Band Boban Markovic Orchestra in the "Brotherhood of Brass" project. 

In 1990, upon learning of the death of San Antonio based legendary accordionist Santiago Jiménez Jr.'s bassist Juan Viesca, Rubin became his full time string bassist, mastering the old fashioned hispanic "tololoche'" slap style. In 1991 he arranged a 3 record A&R deal for Jimenez, Jr. on the Austin TX based Watermelon Records label. The first "Corason de Piedra" garnered a Grammy Nomination.

In 1992, Rubin began working with Eastern European immigrant musicians from in and around the Houston area from the Polish and Czech speaking communities. Rubin produced or appears on releases for Texas-Polish dance band fiddler Brian Marshall and his Texas Slavic Playboys and Texas-Czech Accordionist Mark Halata and Texavia, appearing with both groups on the National Council of Traditional Arts touring roster for over two decades.

Rubin as a bassist is featured at the annual Festival of Texas Fiddling, as its founder noted the festival was "based on his fieldwork."

Mediaeval Baebes
----------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/medi%C3%A6val-b%C3%A6bes-mn0000869239/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/medi%C3%A6val-b%C3%A6bes-mn0000869239/biography+]

The Mediaeval Baebes are a crossover vocal ensemble whose unique style features a deft mixture of medieval music, multi-language texts, modern arrangements, and both ancient and modern instrumentation. Their skillful and attractive arrangements, usually fashioned by member Katharine Blake, often have a dark, somber character while exhibiting contemporary rhythmic and sound features. Consisting of about six to twelve singers, Mediaeval Baebes are typically attired in long, sometimes provocative gowns or gothic-inspired costumes, and may wear, depending on the concert's theme, vampiric teeth, flowered headwear, or other exotic accoutrements. Song texts typically deal with such subjects as death, drunkenness, unrequited love, and religious and supernatural subjects. The ensemble's members often play an instrument during performance. Katharine Blake, Bev Lee Harling, and Jo Burke, for example, are violinists; Emily Ovenden and Blake play the recorder; and other members, Esther Dee, Clare Edmondson, and Tanya Jackson, play various instruments. Over the years the group has made use of accompanists like Frank Moon (oud, cittern, etc.) and Rebecca Dutton (medieval fiddle, psaltery, etc.). The range of languages in which the Mediaeval Baebes sing is vast and includes Latin, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Irish Gaelic, English, various older forms of English, and such archaic languages as Cornish and Welsh. They have regularly toured the U.K., Europe, Canada, and the U.S., and have recorded for such labels as Nettwerk Records, Caroline, and Virgin Records. 

The Mediaeval Baebes were formed in London in 1996. Founding members included Katharine Blake, who also serves as the ensemble's musical director, and Dorothy Carter, who played several medieval stringed instruments like the hurdy-gurdy and hammered dulcimer. Some of the earliest members were drawn from Blake's musical group the Miranda Sex Garden, and included Teresa Casella.

After early concert success, the Mediaeval Baebes were invited onto Thames Television in 1997 to sing the 14th century hymn Gaudete. Their first album, Salva Nos, was issued on Virgin Records the following year and its chart-topping success led to more presitigious concert venues and a string of popular recordings, including Undrentide, issued in 2000 on Nettwerk Records. Other notable early successes included acclaimed performances at the November 2002 Festival of Immortality in Vancouver, Canada.

In 2003 Dorothy Carter died, aged 68. Her passing was only one of many changes in the group's personnel: that same year Emily Ovenden joined and Melanie Garside (2005), also known as Maple Bee, Claire Rabbitt (2005), and Melpomeni Kermanidou (2006), were later additions, the latter three leaving after several years' service. Meanwhile the Mediaeval Baebes were making headway on other fronts: they sang on the soundtrack to the 2005 BBC production of The Virgin Queen, which received the Ivor Novello award for best television soundtrack in 2007. Their 2008 U.S. tour included acclaimed performances at the Maryland Renaissance Festival in October. Their recordings continued to have great success, as evidenced by their popular 2009 CD, Illumination, on Universal. The Mediaeval Baebes' 2011 concert schedule included acclaimed tours of the U.S. (East Coast) in September and U.K. (Bournemouth, Cornwall, etc.) in December.

Aldana was born in Santiago, Chile.[1] She began playing the saxophone when she was six,[2] under the influence and tuition of her father Marcos Aldana, also a professional saxophonist.[3][2] Aldana began with alto, influenced by artists such as Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley and Michael Brecker.[3] However, upon first hearing the music of Sonny Rollins, she switched to tenor; the first tenor saxophone she used was a Selmer Mark VI that had belonged to her grandfather.[3][1]

She started performing in Santiago jazz clubs in her early teens.[3][2] In 2005, after meeting him while he was on tour in Chile, she was invited by pianist Danilo Pérez to play at the Panama Jazz Festival,[3][1] as well as a number of auditions at music schools in the USA.[1] As a result of these introductions she went on to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where her tutors included Joe Lovano, George Garzone, Frank Tiberi, Greg Osby, Hal Crook, Bill Pierce, and Ralph Peterson.

This creatively named band was formed when the members were studying vocal music together and started busking in the streets of London. Madra, their first album, is largely a capella, and composed entirely of traditional British songs. Their later releases -- like 1993's Suspiria and 1994's Fairytales of Slavery -- saw the group moving in a more rock/industrial direction, pitting their smooth voices upon layers of distortion, feedback, and heavy drums. Carnival of Souls was released in summer 2000.

Mischief Brew was an American band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, which played DIY anarcho-punk music, incorporating a variety of styles including American folk, swing, and Gypsy-punk.

It was started by Erik Petersen as a solo project, but eventually grew into a band. Petersen drew inspiration from the protest movements of the 1960s,[1] "the idea that rebellion in music didn't originate in punk rock" (Profane Existence No. 54, 2007), and anti-establishment artists like Woody Guthrie and Crass.[1] Petersen's lyrics often pay homage to American labor radicalism of the early 20th century.[2][3]

Mischief Brew has released albums and EPs on many different labels, notably Art of the Underground, Gunner Records, and Fistolo Records.[4] In support of these records, Mischief Brew toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe.[5] When playing live, they performed with four to five people, incorporating such instruments as junk/found percussion, trumpet, accordion, violin, mandolin, and vibraphone into their set.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_(band)[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_(band)+]

Molotov is a Mexican rap rock band formed in Mexico City in 1995. Their lyrics, which are rapped and sung by all members of the group, feature a mixture of Spanish and English. The band members switch instruments and roles depending on what song they are performing.

The band began in 1995 when two friends, Tito Fuentes (guitar) and Micky "Chicho" Huidobro (bass), started playing together. On September 21 of the same year, Javier de la Cueva "J" and Iván Jared Moreno "La Quesadillera" joined them becoming the first line up for the band. Iván Jared Moreno, "La Quesadillera", would eventually leave, to be replaced by Randy Ebright (who joined the band in October 1995[2]), the only US-born member of the band. Around February 1996 de la Cueva would also leave, being replaced by Paco Ayala, establishing the four-member line-up that has remained consistent over the years.

Throughout 1996, the band played in many underground locations in Mexico City and began to have a small group of fans. Their success finally came when they opened for Héroes del Silencio in Monterrey and later for La Lupita in Puebla. During a concert in which they opened for Illya Kuryaki and The Valderramas, talent hunters from Universal offered them to record an album. It was a difficult period, and the band had to sell cassettes during the concerts while they prepared their album.

In July 1997, they released their debut album ¿Dónde Jugarán las Niñas?, which took its name partly from Maná's album ¿Dónde Jugarán los Niños? generating controversy with stores refusing to sell it because of its lyrics and cover. Molotov went out to the street to sell their discs as a form of protest. The lyrics include a mixture of politics, sex and expletives, which made it hard for Molotov to enter mainstream media. In 1998, they participated with the song "Payaso" in the album Volcán: Tributo a José José a tribute to legendary singer José José.

Molotov received a recognition without precedent for a hip-hop group in Spanish. Urban publications such as Vibe said about them: "[Molotov's music] is incendiary by nature… with darts poisoned aimed directly to the heart of the oppressive paternalism of the government."[3] For example, the song "Gimme Tha Power" contained lyrics such as "Hay que arrancar el problema de raíz y cambiar el gobierno de nuestro país" (translated: We have to rip out the problem by the roots and change the government of our country). These lyrics reflected aspects of the tumultuous political climate of the late 1990s. In 2000, popular vote elected a president from a different political party than that which had held the presidency, uninterrupted, since 1940.

“They’re from Norway,” the editor said. Well, that’s a good start, I thought, when I was asked to review this album by a band I’d never heard of before. Over the last decade, Norway has for this reviewer been something of an El Dorado of great new jazz music, with fine artists such as Eyolf Dale, Pixel and Daniel Herskedal producing great album after great album. It’s become one of my go-to jazz nations.

But I was taking a leap in the dark with Moskus – comprising Anya Lauvdal, keyboards; Fredrik Luhr Deitrichson, double bass; and Hans Hulbaekmo on drums/percussion – which is trailed as heavily improvised, almost free jazz. And that can often be musical kryptonite for me. But, all in all, this was rather fun and most definitely eclectic.

Mirakler feels like a jazz album film director David Lynch would make. Defiantly odd, unnervingly eerie, simply weird in parts, there is nonetheless something oddly compelling. It’s not the melodies – there are few. And it doesn’t swing – rather, it jumps, shuffles and stumbles around. No, Moskus just exists in its own musical world. It stands proudly defiant and says: “tart, unusual and crunchy sounds are all we offer”. A cornichon in a world full of jazz pickled onions.

Sang til C is a five-minute musical doodle which goes everywhere and nowhere but, in those five minutes, has a story of sorts to tell. Eventyrdagene introduces a child’s electric piano, tambourine and muted bass – plus some piano – in a charmingly naive little tune that sounds like the cast of Play-Away rehearsing after a particularly heavy night on the sauce. But, if you give it time, moods and musical pictures emerge.

Each tune is different in style to the previous. Voyager is ’60s space-age jazz, vibraphones, synths and bass piano notes, producing something akin to the soundtrack of an East German puppet show about the first German cosmonaut Sigmünd Jahn. It is really rather fun, particularly Deitrichson’s simple but oddly insistent bass.

Haiku is 13 seconds long. Yes, you read that correctly.

Min venna skaperverk is perhaps the most conventional track on the album, it has a sort of Jim Morrison psychedelic mood to its opening bars – but with added milk bottles – and builds over time before a dramatic pause. But again, one minute 18. What Moskus lack in melody, they make up for in brevity.

This is certainly one of the strangest albums I’ve reviewed. Can I say I enjoyed it? I’m genuinely not sure. I can certainly say I experienced something unique, a refreshingly non-commercial album that’s stubborn in its idiosyncrasy. Mirakler has a fragile beauty to it and deserves further listening, because there’s gold in these Norwegian waters. You just have to search very hard for it.

Mount Eerie is the musical project of Anacortes, Washington-based songwriter and producer Phil Elverum. Elverum (formerly of The Microphones) is the principal member of the band, but has collaborated with many other musicians on his records and in live performances. Most of Mount Eerie's releases have been issued on Elverum's label P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd., and feature highly detailed packaging with his own artwork.

As Mount Eerie, Washington state songwriter/multi-instrumentalist/producer Phil Elverum expands on the searching, deeply personal feel of his work with the Microphones. His confessional lyrics and free-flowing storytelling are the main constant of his work, which incorporates touches of ambient, folk and black metal in impressionistic ways that heighten the feeling of wonder in his music. On early albums such as 2005's No Flashlight, the difference between Elverum's work as Mount Eerie and the Microphones was subtle, but later releases showed how much his range had grown. The metal-influenced majesty of 2009's Wind's Poem, the serene electro-acoustic meditations of Clear Moon, and the dense soundscapes of Ocean's Roar (both from 2012) all reflected different sides of his musings on life and death. Elverum documented the aftermath of his wife Geneviève Castrée's death from pancreatic cancer on 2017's A Crow Looked at Me and the following year's Now Only, both of which were widely acclaimed for their eloquent, unflinching expressions of grief.

The musical traditions of Sweden and India come together with a global range of influences to create the unique music of Mynta. A true cultural exchange between Indian tabla player Fazal Qureshi and classical vocalist Shankar Mohadevan and Swedish musicians Anders Hagberg (flute, soprano and willow flute), Max Ahman (acoustic guitar), Mikael Nilsson (percussion) and Christian Paulin (electric bass), Mynta blends Indian, African, Latin-American, Arabic, Swedish, and Norwegian music. According to Option magazine, "Qureshi and Mikael Nilsson lay down some of the most electrifying percussion grooves I've heard in years; and in it's blinding, effortless, speed, Max Ahman's guitar pays homage to John McLaughlin. Mix in Swedish hammered dulcimer, the Indian santoor and tanpura, and the North African saz and this becomes an exotic sort of orchestra. With groups like Mynta, it's clear that Scandanavia is turning out the most fascinating and enjoyable world fusion around." 

Conceived by electric bassist Christian Paulin, Mynta initially focused on blues and Latin-influenced jazz. Their debut album reflected the influence of Chick Corea and Gary Burton. Shifting to a more-improvisatory style of jazz fusion, in the 1980s, the group often performed with Swedish vocalist Maritza Horn. A turning point in the band's evolution came when they met Qureshi and Mohadevan while touring India in 1987. With the addition of the two India musicians, Mynta moved towards the world fusion on which they've built their international reputation. Mynta has gone through numerous personnel changes. Former members include tenor saxophonist Stefan Isaksson, alto saxophonist Jonas Knutsson, guitarist Max Schultz, and drummer Magnus Persson.

Nils Økland (born 7 January 1961) is a Norwegian Hardanger fiddle player known as a bridge builder between contemporary music and folk music, and the brother of the musician Torbjørn Økland. 

Økland performed with the short-lived musical group Løver og Tigre ("Lions and Tigers," 1983), with Balkansemblet (1984-1995 and 2005-) and in a duo along with jazz bassist Bjørnar Andresen (Hot Club Records, 1986). Along with Arvid Gangsø and Jorun Hafstad he played in the trio Skinn og Bein ("Skin and Bones," which recorded Knaus — en samtidscollage (contemporary rock, Hot Club Records, 1989). Along with the improvisational band Supersilent he appeared on BBC Radio 3's broadcast The Wire Sessions Live (2000), where the concert program described Økland as a "virtuoso of the traditional Hardanger fiddle with a solo set that lights up the grey area separating folk forms from free improvisation and modern composition."[1]

After the solo recording Blå harding (Morild, 1996), he recorded Straum ("Stream", Rune Grammofon, 2000) along with organist and ethnomusicologist Sigbjørn Apeland on the harmonium, brother Torbjørn Økland on guitar, Pål Thorstensen on bass and vocalist Åsne Valland Nordli. Bris, a recent recording ("Breeze," Rune Grammofon, 2004) which featured his own compositions, was a collaboration with Sigbjørn Apeland, Mats Eilertsen on bass, Per Oddvar Johansen on drums and Håkon Mørch Stene on percussion. Portions of the recording were Økland's music for Jon Fosse's play Melankolika, a play based on the tragic life of the artist Lars Hertervig (1830-1902).[2]

As conductor at the Ole Bull Academy for six years, Økland organized Concerts Norway, an initiative to regularly perform quality music on a very intensive schedule throughout Norway. He collaborated on several recordings with jazz musician Christian Wallumrød's ensemble and, with Berit Opheim (vocals) and Bjørn Kjellemyr (bass), recorded for the trio BNB. Økland has also played on CDs issued by Benedicte Maurseth, Knut Hamre, Kari Bremnes, Alf Cranner, Karoline Krüger and Hans Fredrik Jacobsen.

The Nordic Fiddlers Bloc is a fiddle trio from Norway, Sweden and the Shetland Islands who swiftly gained a reputation for their gripping and unique blend of fiddle music since their inception in early 2009.

Comprising Olav Luksengård Mjelva (Norway), Anders Hall (Sweden) and Kevin Henderson (Shetland Islands), each regarded as leading exponents of their respective traditions, they have found themselves in great demand throughout the world performing together as ‘The Nordic Fiddlers Bloc.’

With a firm focus on the rich traditional fiddle music from where they each belong, they have developed a sound that has been described as “unique”, “meaningful”, “intense” and “invigorating”. Their clever use of harmony, rhythm, riffs and bass lines creates a sound that leaves the listener enthralled but at the same time dumbfounded that the sound only comes from three fiddles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noura_Mint_Seymali[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noura_Mint_Seymali+]

Noura Mint Seymali was born in Mauritania to parents Dimi Mint Abba and Seymali Ould Ahmed Vall. Both parents were important musical figures in Mauritania. Her father, Seymali, is a Moorish composer who adapted Mauritania's national anthem.[1] Her step-mother, Dimi, was one of her country's most famous singers, and was known as the "diva of the desert". At the age of 13, Noura began composing for her mother, as well as touring with her as a backup singer.[2] Through the musical members of her family, she was able to master the ardin, a nine-stringed harp reserved for women, as well as getting her feet wet in the world of performances.[3]

Following her marriage to her guitarist, Jeiche Ould Chighaly, Noura began playing weddings with him.[4] With the help of her husband, they formed their first band in 2004. After the local release of two albums, they then returned to the studio to create the band's first full-length album, Tzenni. The album was released in 2014 via Glitterbeat Records. The band continues to play at music festivals around the world.[3]

Noura is trained in playing the ardin, the traditional Mauritanian instrument for female griots. She considers herself and her music to be non-political in nature.[4] In 2018, Noura hosted the Malian Tuareg band Tinariwen during their travels in Mauritania, and appeared on their 2019 album Amadjar.

Noura Mint Seymali has performed in many places around the world since their band formation in 2004. Some of the famous festivals that they've performed at are globalFEST located in the United States, Festival au Désert located in Mali, and Hayy Festival located in Egypt. Noura Mint Seymali's combination of different genres of Moorish music with pop music has given them a large platform of audiences.[3][4] Her band includes Jeiche Ould Chighaly on guitar and tidinit, Ousmane Tour on bass, Matthew Tinari on drums, Ayniyana Chighaly on backing vocals and ardin, and Mayassa Hemed Vall on backing vocals and percussion.

Orgone

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/orgone-mn0000408175[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/orgone-mn0000408175+]

With a lively, evocative set of covers and original material, Los Angeles-based ensemble Orgone brought new attention to the funk revivalist and jam band circuits when they launched their recording career with Ubiquity Records in the mid- to late 2000s. Orgone's sound hosts a myriad of groove-oriented styles, including but not limited to deep funk, '60s Memphis soul/blues, Fela-inspired Afro-beat, hip-hop, Latin jazz, and electronic dance and house. Many of the band's musicians started playing together in the early '90s, but Orgone did not develop into a tight-knit ensemble until the end of the decade. The core lineup of the band eventually came to consist of Sergio Rios (guitar), Dan Hastie (Rhodes, clavinet, Hammond B-3 organ), Sean O'Shea (drums), Ethan Phillips (bass), Stewart Killen (various percussion), Darren Cardoza (trombone), Devin Williams (trumpet), and Joel Bowers (saxophone). Other than working live jam sessions, Orgone mainly backed hip-hop acts on tour or in the studio until around 2001, when bandmembers saw vocalist Fanny Franklin perform with L.A.-based hip-hop orchestra Dakah. With Franklin added to the mix, the funk jam band was more eager to make its own recordings, cutting one of its earliest songs, a cover of the Beginning of the End's '70s funk hit "Funky Nassau," for Ubiquity compilation Rewind! 4 (2004). While Orgone served as the on-stage band for the likes of Little Brother, the Pharcyde, Pharoahe Monch, and Tone-Loc, Ubiquity issued their I Get Lifted 12" and The Duck Gravy 7" in spring 2007. All of these singles appeared on The Killion Floor, released later that year. In 2010, Orgone re-emerged with their sophomore effort, Cali Fever, and issued their first all-instrumental effort, Killion Vaults.

Perhaps better known outside of avant-garde circles for his work as a cartoonist, Peter Blegvad was also a witty and articulate singer/songwriter as well as an alumnus of Slapp Happy. Born August 14, 1951, in New York City, Blegvad and his family moved to Britain in 1965. After relocating to Germany in the early '70s, he formed the self-described "champions of naïve rock" Slapp Happy with British composer Anthony Moore and singer Dagmar Krause. Upon releasing a handful of albums, in 1975 the group teamed with fellow avant-pranksters Henry Cow for a pair of LPs before splitting up. 

After recording 1977's Kew. Rhone. with Henry Cow bassist John Greaves, Blegvad returned to Britain and mounted a solo career in 1983 with the Andy Partridge-produced The Naked Shakespeare. While in New York, he worked with Anton Fier's Golden Palominos before recording Knights Like This in 1985. Another hiatus followed before Blegvad resurfaced in 1988 with Downtime; King Strut & Other Stories appeared two years later, but when it failed to deliver him the mainstream success so many felt he deserved, he was left without a contract. 

In 1992 Blegvad, whose artwork had long adorned his records, was signed to create a cartoon strip for Britain's Independent on Sunday newspaper; the strip, a surreal, referential work titled Leviathan, gradually emerged as the focus of his career, allowing music to fall by the wayside. Finally, in 1995 he returned to recording with two separate projects: the first, Unearthed, was a spoken word offering, while the other, Just Woke Up, was a more conventional musical work. Hangman's Hill followed in 1998 and Choices Under Pressure appeared three years later. 2003's King Strut & Other Stories found Blegvad assuming the traditional singer/songwriter role. Orpheus the Lowdown followed in 2004.

Pigeons Playing Ping Pong is an American funk jam band from Baltimore, Maryland.[1][2] The band has garnered a following as a result of their consistent touring, playing as many as two hundred shows a year.

Pigeons Playing Ping Pong began in 2009. They released their first full-length album titled Funk E P in 2010.[4][5] This album name is a play on words says vocalist/guitarist Greg Ormont, and unfortunately the name led people to think this first album was just an EP. In July 2014, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong released their second full-length album titled Psychology.[1][4][6][7][8][9] Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has hosted Domefest every year since 2009. The location of the festival has changed periodically but is currently held at Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, WV.

A Latvian experimental band.

https://popolznowenje.livejournal.com/[+https://popolznowenje.livejournal.com/+]

Мы никогда не видели её в чистом виде, но ежечасно имеем с ней дело.

Вся кажущаяся парадоксальность Popolznowenj*я – это парадоксальность пустоты. В ней нет ничего, она чиста от чего бы то ни было, но именно из неё всё приходит, и именно в ней обретает последнее пристанище, уходит в неё без остатка, при этом ни на йоту не заполняя её.

Пустота – не гордая, она с лёгкостью может быть как всеобъемлющей, так и малой. Ни один из великих Богов не может похвастать такой всепроникающей гибкой способностью. Поэтому боги, питающиеся поклонением вечно неравной себе паствы, грузнеют и превращаются в тяжёлых монстрообразных идолов, пустота же, наоборот, никогда не превращается в памятник самой себе. Она вечно живая, хоть и смертельная госпожа. Её не поймать за хвост, не выставить за дверь. Из неё состоят галактики и атомы, она – главный ингридиент всего. Любая материя, по данным современной науки, процентов на девяносто девять плюс бесконечное количество девяток после запятой, состоит из пустоты. Мы сами, всё, что мы видим и всё, что мы знаем, есть не более, чем её анкетные данные. Так как же мы можем самоунижаться, склоняться, или, наоборот, как можно возвыситься над тем, из чего состоишь на девяносто девять плюс бесконечное количество девяток после запятой процента? Говорят, что жизнь – это форма организации материи, но сама материя – это форма организации пустоты.

И в то же время, подобно человеку, большей частью состоящему из воды, но при этом способному испытывать жажду, людям, состоящим из пустоты, может катастрофически её не хватать: в отсутствии чувства пустоты нам становиться тесно, нам не хватает её свежего воздуха и необъятных пространств, ощущения вольной воли, переполняющей грудь и все остальные члены души и тела.

Поползновенец не просто помнит о пустоте:он блюдёт её, словно правило гигиены, поддерживает её с методичностью домохозяйки, поддерживающей чистоту в доме. При этом Поползновенец – отнюдь не фанатик её, он не доводит стремление к пустоте до полной опустошённости: скорее, подобно пассажиру в общественном транспорте, он вежливо уступает ей место и не препирается с ней из-за житейских пустяков. Пустота для Поползновенца чем-то похожа на старую богатую тётушку, с которой определённо лучше поддерживать хорошие отношения. Прислушаться к ней не всегда приятно, но в высшей степени мудро – она никогда ничего не обещает, но реально может многое дать. Не отпугивает даже тот факт, что завещание её вступает в силу не с её кончиной (которой, как мы понимаем, никогда не бывать), а с условной кончиной самого наследника (по крайней мере, со смертью его эго), – тем желанней, загадочней и соблазнительней само содержимое её наследства.

Поползновенцу мало признания пустотности всего. Путь буддийского отшельника – хорош, но слишком инертен для него. Поползновенец действием проверяет принцип пустотелости собственного бытия, жадно улавливая все возможные эффекты и следствия этой гремучей смеси, сочетающей в себе порядок и хаос, правило и импровизацию, Голос и тишину.

----------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/red-baraat-mn0002370406[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/red-baraat-mn0002370406+]

Eight-piece dhol and brass ensemble Red Baraat hail from Brooklyn, New York. (The dhol is a large hand-held drum with two heads meant to be played on both the top and bottom; the dance drum in Punjabi music, it's heard in virtually all music from Bollywood.) The group's sound is an amalgam of South Asian wedding bands, pop, bhangra funk, big-band jazz, Balkan wedding music, and the sounds of New Orleans brass bands. Red Baraat were founded by dhol player Sunny Jain in 2008. His previous band, the Sunny Jain Collective, included in its lineup future jazz pioneers Vijay Iyer, Rudresh Mahanthappa, and Rez Abbasi. The new group's sound stands in sharp contrast to the more genre-specific SJC brand of carnatic jazz. Red Baraat's instrumentation includes the dhol, other percussion, two trumpets (one of them a bass trumpet), trombone, sousaphone, and baritone and soprano saxophones. The band's first effort was 2009's Chaal Baby, issued on the independent Sinj label. It was followed by relentless national touring that saw the band perform marathon shows at small clubs, the White House, and the Bonnaroo festival. Red Baraat's second album, Shruggy Ji, was released in January of 2013 and reached number one on the Billboard World Albums chart. Gaadi of Truth followed in 2015 and also landed on the World Albums chart. Their next release, the 2016 EP Livewire, captured a performance at the KEXP studio in Seattle that incorporated electric guitar and live effects on some of the acoustic instruments. The ensemble's fourth full-length, Bhangra Pirates, arrived via Rhyme & Reason in 2017.

Sarathy Korwar is a US-born, Indian-raised, London-based drummer, percussionist, composer and bandleader. He works predominantly in a jazz and Indo jazz field but also incorporates elements of hip-hop, and other fusions.

Born in the US, Korwar grew up in Chennai and Ahmedabad in India and began studying tabla aged 10. He later moved to Pune to study Geology from Fergusson College, Pune before making the decision to dedicate his time to music, continuing to study tabla with Rajeev Devasthali as well as translating his skills to the western drum kit and playing as a session musician. He then moved to London and continued his studies with Sanju Sahai at SOAS.

In 2016 Korwar released the album Day To Day on the Ninja Tune label. This record incorporated field recordings of the Siddi people of Southern India blended with his own compositions drawing from contemporary jazz and electronic music.[3]

He leads the UPAJ Collective, a collective of Eastern and Western musicians formed play a residency at London's Jazz Cafe. The group recorded the live album My East Is Your West at London's Church Of Sound, released on Gearbox Records on 9th November 2018. The group performed compositions by jazz musicians Alice Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders and Joe Henderson as well as Indian classical music and Indo jazz.[4][2]

On 26 July 2019 Korwar released his second studio album, More Arriving through The Leaf Label. Recorded over three years in Mumbai and London, the album incorporates rappers from Mumbai and New Delhi with spoken word and his own Indian classical influence and jazz instrumentation. The album featured the Jamaican-Indian rapper Delhi Sultanate, the London poet Zia Ahmed and the Abu Dhabi writer Deepak Unnikrishnan among others. Korwar describes the album as a protest record and said: “This is what Indian music sounds like to me right now, and that means incorporating multiple brown voices. If anyone has a problem with that, they should be questioning what they think Indian music should be.”[5][6]

Korwar has collaborated with Shabaka Hutchings, clarinettist Arun Ghosh and producer Hieroglyphic Being, as well as groups Penya and Ill Considered. He has toured with Kamasi Washington, Yussef Kamaal and Moses Boyd.

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shriekback-mn0000035864/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shriekback-mn0000035864/biography+]

Shriekback is not an easy band to classify. They borrowed heavily from funk but had a very different agenda; their music was more suited for contemplation than for parties. They combined synthesizers and drum machines with throbbing bass lines and unorthodox vocals to evoke a primordial world where the line between human and animal was blurred. The title of their fourth album, Big Night Music, might be the most succinct summation of their work: Shriekback's music was always an appropriate soundtrack for life in the dark, but with the emphasis on the possibilities rather than the dangers. Though often haunting, it was not gothic and harbored strains of pop and dance that rose to the surface from time to time. Still, however accessible they became, Shriekback cultivated an air of mystery that made them hard to pin down. Further complicating any evaluation of their career is the fact that they never made a single, brilliant album that concentrated all their strengths in one place; their best material is spread out across a decade during which they underwent a great deal of evolution.

Shriekback came together in 1982 as a loose association based around the trio of Dave Allen (bass), Barry Andrews (keyboards/vocals), and Carl Marsh (vocals/guitar). Allen and Andrews had previously been members of Gang of Four and XTC, respectively; Marsh had played with the more obscure Out on Blue Six. They quickly developed a trademark sound that had little to do with the members' previous credits. The bedrock of that sound was Allen's muscular yet liquid bass playing, which was a quantum leap beyond his relatively crude work with Gang of Four. On top of this Shriekback deployed creative and intricate drum programs; Andrews' multifaceted synthesizer shadings; strategically placed, mostly rhythm guitar from Marsh; and whispered vocals from Andrews along with Marsh's more melodic singing. Both vocalists were technically limited, but this was more than compensated for by the band's tight playing and evocative, intelligent lyrics. 

 The first Shriekback release was the six-song EP Tench, which appeared on the English Y label in 1982. It was followed in 1983 by the LP Care, also on Y, which featured the quasi-hit "Lined Up," the song that put Shriekback on the map for many people. Care was picked up and released in the U.S. by Warner Brothers, with an altered running order and two different tracks, including the polyrhythmic "My Spine (Is the Bass Line)."

Although Care was critically acclaimed and garnered a fair amount of airplay from both college radio and fledgling modern rock radio, that was not enough for Warner Brothers, who dropped Shriekback and deleted Care shortly after its release. As a result, the follow-up, 1984's Jam Science, was released only in Europe (this time on Arista). Slicker, less murky, and more focused on electronics than its predecessor, Jam Science contained the dub-influenced single "Hand on My Heart."

Much of Shriekback's music from this early period is most readily available on two mistitled, poorly packaged, but indispensable CDs from Kaz Records. The Best of Shriekback: The Infinite is made up of seven songs from Care, three from Tench, and the single "Working on the Ground." The Best of Shriekback Volume Two: Evolution offers one more song from Care and five from Jam Science, along with a nice assortment of remixes and B-sides.

Toward the end of the Jam Science sessions, Shriekback became a quartet with the addition of drummer Martyn Barker; however, they quickly became a trio again when Carl Marsh departed midway through the recording of their third album. Andrews took over as sole vocalist and the addition of Lu Edmonds on guitar brought a more aggressive sound to Oil and Gold, which was released in 1985. Songs like "Malaria" and "Nemesis" rocked harder than anything Shriekback had recorded before, bringing them a far wider audience than they had previously enjoyed. Oil and Gold sold well in its U.S. release on Island Records. 

Shriekback released two more albums on Island in the '80s. 1986's Big Night Music featured a core trio of Allen, Andrews, and Barker augmented by hired hands like Mike Cozzi (guitar), Steve Halliwell (keyboards), and Wendy and Sarah Partridge (backing vocals). Continuing Oil and Gold's move toward accessibility, Big Night Music had a more organic sound with an emphasis on live percussion. Shriekback seemed poised on the brink of unlikely stardom, but Allen departed before the recording of Go Bang! (1988), which was poorly received by both critics and fans. Perhaps they were put off by the absence of Allen's signature low end, or maybe it was the inconsistent material, including an ill-advised cover of KC and the Sunshine Band's "Get Down Tonight." 

That appeared to be the end of Shriekback, who dropped out of sight in the late '80s and early '90s. Their only release during that period was the 1990 compilation The Dancing Years. But Allen, Andrews, and Barker reunited in 1992 to record the excellent Sacred City, which essentially picked up where Big Night Music left off. There was another long silence after that, but in 2000 the band returned; Andrews, Barker, Edmonds, and two new members released Naked Apes and Pond Life on the Australian Mushroom label. That kicked off a very busy decade, with studio LPs including Having a Moment, Cormorant, and Glory Bumps (the latter two basically Andrews solo projects), as well as several compilation releases. The self-released Life in the Loading Bay followed in 2010, and Without Real String or Fish in 2015.

A bit unusual chamber math rock band from Brooklyn, NY was founded in 1999. Influenced by Phillip Glass, Miles Davis, Cluster, their play very atmospheric, bright and minimalistic music, with differences in every song. Electro-acoustic chamber group (comprised of two violins, a drummer, guitarist and keyboardist (strictly a Fender Rhodes)) with strong accent on strings, they uses video projectors and desktop computers during their live shows in clubs. Their elegant music is full of heart-breaking melodies and broken beats. Slow Six has one foot on the shifty shores of rock and one foot on the rocky crags of postmodern classicism.

PRIVATE TIMES IN PUBLIC PLACES, the band's debut, was included in Time Out New York's top 10 classical recordings in 2004, but to label the group's music as merely classical is a tragedy. Hints of jazz, math rock and ambient music reside in the music, and set the band apart from other bands working with synthetic and organic elements. Electronics, strings, guitar and drums intertwine and build like a brewing storm, only to hurtle into a striking crescendo of magnificently orchestrated lightning bolts of notes. The legato feel of the songs, however, makes the clap of cascading notes go down smoothly.

Their second album was released in 2007 (NOR'EASTER). Both albums are very interesting music for fans of neo-minimalism combined with electronic processing and rock aesthetics.

Guitarist, educator, and historian Stefan Grossman was a student of acoustic blues and gospel singer/guitarist Rev. Gary Davis. Beginning when he was 15, Grossman studied with Davis on weekends, spending eight to ten hours at his house in Harlem, absorbing all he could. After studying with Davis for eight years in high school and college, he learned and studied with other country blues guitarists: Mississippi John Hurt, Son House, Skip James, Mance Lipscomb, and Fred McDowell. Other early influences for Grossman included Elizabeth Cotten, Sam McGee, Willie Brown, and Charley Patton.

In the early '60s, Grossman formed the Even Dozen Jug Band and worked with the political rock band the Fugs before moving to Great Britain. In 1968, he co-founded Kicking Mule Records with Ed Denson, a label that showcased idiosyncratic acoustic blues and folk guitar styles. The co-founders dissolved their partnership in the mid-'80s, but Kicking Mule's catalog was purchased by Fantasy Records. Some of the vinyl sides have seen the light of day on compact disc. From 1967 to the early '80s, Grossman lived in Great Britain, where he carved a reputation on the European blues and folk festival circuit, playing with British-raised acoustic guitarists like John Renbourn and John Fahey. 

Grossman's solo discography goes all the way back to 1966, when he recorded How to Play Blues Guitar for Elektra Records; his sessionography also includes recordings with the Even Dozen Jug Band (which also included such future luminaries as John Sebastian, Maria Muldaur, and David Grisman) as well as albums by Paul Simon, John Fahey, Charlie Musselwhite, and Happy Traum. In the early '80s, Grossman began a long relationship with Shanachie Records of Newton, NJ, recording extensively and issuing such albums as Shining Shadows (1988), Guitar Landscapes (1990), Love, Devils & the Blues (1992), Northern Skies, Southern Blues (1997), and Shake That Thing: Fingerpicking Country Blues (1998) for the label. He also helped Shanachie launch their Guitar Artistry imprint series, showcasing such artists as himself, Renbourn, and Traum. While based in northwest New Jersey, Grossman toured infrequently and concentrated his efforts on running his Vestapol instructional video business, releasing videos (many of which are now available on DVD) by guitarists ranging from Merle Travis and Chet Atkins to Dave Van Ronk and Brownie McGhee. 

During the 2000s, Grossman could be found recording in duo and trio settings (2007’s Bermuda Triangle Exit with Tokio Uchida and Played a Little Fiddle with Danny Kalb and Steve Katz) and releasing the results on his Guitar Workshop label -- which also issued albums by the likes of Davy Graham, Happy Traum, and David Laibman as well as archival recordings and a number of various-artist collections. In 2006 he began touring once again, making appearances in the U.S., England, Europe, and Japan. Grossman remains one of the world's foremost authorities on acoustic blues guitar.

Teddybears
----------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/teddybears-mn0000986695/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/teddybears-mn0000986695/biography+]

Notable for their eclectic musical style as much as for wearing large bear heads, Teddybears were formed in Sweden in the early '90s. Although the group -- whose members also direct videos, short films, and commercials -- takes on a variety of genres including electronic, dance, rock, and reggae, Teddybears' original incarnation was as a grindcore band. Members Patrik Arve and Joakim Åhlund (who is also guitarist for the Caesars) had met in art school in Stockholm, soon adding Åhlund's brother Klas on guitar. In defiance of typical grindcore band names, the group switched its first name, Skull, to Teddybears, named after a band from the '50s featuring Phil Spector. After Teddybears' drummer left, the other members relied upon drum machines, guitars, and vocoders. The result was the electronic-leaning Rock 'n' Roll Highschool in 2000, followed by Fresh in 2005. Signing on with Atlantic, the band's first U.S. release, Soft Machine, came out in September 2006 and featured guests Iggy Pop, Annie, Neneh Cherry, Mad Cobra, and Ebbot Lundberg of the Soundtrack of Our Lives. Devil's Music followed in 2010, starring the likes of Eve, B.o.B, the Flaming Lips, CeeLo Green & the B-52's, and Robyn. After years of silence, they returned in 2015 with teaser tracks featuring reggae star Beenie Man and dancehall king Cutty Ranks. They released Rock On in early 2016.

"With such a longwinded moniker, it seems likely that Thinking Fellers Union Local #282 could be nothing but a bunch of pretentious art-school rejects. Fortunately, that's pretty far from the truth -- their sound is a hybrid of art rock and punk rock, based on noodling on organs, electric banjos, mandolins and heavy, fuzzed-out guitar blasts. The group formed in 1987 in San Francisco and released their first album Wormed By Leonard on their own label Thwart a year later. In 1991, the group made the jump to the Matador label, where they released 1991's critically acclaimed Lovelyville, 1992's Mother Of All Saints and 1994's Strangers From the Universe. They moved to Ajax for the following year's Funeral Pudding and then to Communion for 1996's I Hope It Lands, where they remained on the roster for the rest of the '90s despite their lack of further releases. However, they continued to play sporadic, spontaneous dates and a new album was rumored for a 2001 release."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Fellers_Union_Local_282[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Fellers_Union_Local_282+]

Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 is an American experimental indie rock group, which was formed in 1986 in San Francisco, California, United States, though half of its members are from Iowa.[1][2] Their albums combine lo-fi noise rock and ambient sounds (referred to as "Feller filler")[3] with tightly constructed rock and pop songs. The band has a small but intensely loyal cult following. Band members are Brian Hageman, Mark Davies, Anne Eickelberg, Hugh Swarts and Jay Paget. Hageman was also a member of the Iowa City based group, Horny Genius.

The band achieved their greatest critical and commercial success in the mid-1990s, when they signed with the indie rock label Matador Records. It was during this time that Thinking Fellers produced their most prominent albums, Lovelyville, and Strangers from the Universe. They toured the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK in 1994 and made an appearance on the John Peel radio show on the BBC. In 1996 they toured briefly as an opening act for the then-popular band Live but were not received well by the Live fanbase. Thinking Fellers has been largely dormant since 1996, having toured sporadically and released only one full album, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, since.

In 2001, author Jonathan Franzen referenced the band in his novel The Corrections. The character Brian, a snobbish fan of "west coast underground bands," listens to the albums of Thinking Fellers while writing the music software that will make him a young millionaire.

On January 7, 2011, the All Tomorrow's Parties festival announced a Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 performance at the ATP festival weekend May 13–15, 2011 curated by Animal Collective.

In 2017, Beverly Williams's book Survival Kit's Apocalypse quoted the lines "If the sadness of life makes you tired/And the failures of man make you sigh/You can look to the time soon arriving/When this noble experiment winds down and calls it a day" from the Fellers' song "Noble Experiment" from Strangers from the Universe. In 2019, The National interpolated those same lines in their song "Not in Kansas" on the album I Am Easy to Find.

T.I.S.M.
--------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TISM[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TISM+]

TISM (an acronym of This Is Serious Mum) were a seven-piece anonymous alternative rock band from Melbourne, Australia. The group were formed on 30 December 1982 by vocalist/drummer Humphrey B. Flaubert, bassist/vocalist Jock Cheese and keyboardist/vocalist Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun, and enjoyed a large underground/independent following. Their third album, Machiavelli and the Four Seasons, reached the Australian national top 10 in 1995. 
https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tism-mn0000718695[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tism-mn0000718695+]

TISM (short for This Is Serious, Mum), formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1982, and, after a couple of false starts, became one the most popular underground groups of the Australian music scene. Amazingly, the band even managed to receive some commercial success in the mid-'90s.

TISM have what can only be described as a twisted sense of humor. But whereas bands like They Might Be Giants use their humor to write pop songs with quirky lyrics, TISM use theirs to viciously lampoon anyone and anything. Literally, nothing is sacred, and the band attempts to be as offensive as possible with mixed, although sometimes hilarious, results.

TISM are not publicity-shy in any way, but every time they appear in public (which includes live gigs) they wear masks to hide their identities. Officially, their lineup consists of Ron Hitler-Barassi (vocals), Humphrey B. Flaubert (vocals and drums), Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun (vocals and keyboards), John St. Peenis (formerly saxophone, now vocals), Jock Cheese (bass), Les Miserables (vocals), and Tokin Blackman (formerly known as Tony Coitus) (guitar). Past members include Marco Fessey (saxophone) and Leak Van Vlahen (guitar). 

Forming in Melbourne in 1982, the band wrote to Eddie Van Halen and Australian politician Paul Keating offering them the position of lead tambourine in the band. Both declined.

It wasn't until 1985 that TISM's recordings began to see the light of day. Their debut single "Defecate on my Face" was released that year, although it wasn't until their third single, "40 Years -- Then Death" was released that one of their songs was deemed fit to be played on radio.

A rising tide of interest greeted the band in 1986 following the release of their debut album, Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion. An attempted interview at this time by a well-known music magazine was treated in a typical TISM manner: the journalist stood at the opposite end of a football ground to the band, and shouted questions to them through a megaphone. The answers were then shouted back through another megaphone. To make things even more difficult, a long piece of string ran between the band and the journalist -- the string had to be kept taut or the band wouldn't co-operate. 

In 1988, the album that made their name on the underground circuit appeared. Entitled Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance, the album was full of guitar pop and the same twisted, tasteless lyrics that had been a feature of their work to date. Several singles were released from the album, including "The Ballad of John Bonham's Coke Roadie," "I'm Interested in Apathy," "40 Years -- Then Death," and "Saturday Night Palsy." The last single hovered in the lower regions of the Australian charts, and prompted a popular television show to invite the band to perform the single. TISM performed, but in a move designed to infuriate the show's producers, performed the single with 28 bandmembers, all in full costume.

In 1990, the follow-up, Hot Dogma, was released, but this failed to generate a great deal of interest and sold poorly. None of the TISM sense of humor had been lost here, and song titles from this album included "(I'm Gonna Sit Right Down) And Whittle Away My Furniture," "While My Catarrh Gently Weeps," and "Leo's Toltoy".

The next year, TISM were fired from their record company for being too difficult to work with. However, the small label Shock Records bought the rights to their back catalog and re-released some of their earlier work as a full-length album, Gentlemen, Start Your Egos in 1992. 

This was the catalyst for the band to record another disc, the Beasts of Suburban EP. It was more of the same anarchy, and featured a song entitled "Get Thee to a Nunnery," which was an attack on popular Australian childrens' television presenter Sophie Lee, although the band claimed to respect her work.

In 1993, another only mildly-successful disc, Australia the Lucky C*** was released. While not commercially successful, it proved to be one of their more controversial. The original cover art featured a koala with a syringe in its mouth, drawn in a similar style to art work by well-known Australian designer Ken Done. Done sued the band a week after the release of the disc, and it was withdrawn, but was re-released soon after with new cover art under the title Censored Due to Legal Advice.

Machiavelli and the Four Seasons
Following this release, TISM found themselves in something of a rut. They had been unable to recapture the success of Great Truckin' Songs, and their later releases had been notorious due to surrounding controversy rather than for the music they contained. As a result, their next album Machiavelli and the Four Seasons, released in 1996, marked a substantial change in direction for the band.

Machiavelli saw synthesizers and dance music replace the guitar pop of earlier releases, and, as a consequence, became their biggest commercial success. This was also helped by favorable reviews at the time. The album went gold in Australia, and a number of singles were released from it, including "Jung Talent Time," "Greg! The Stop Sign!" (a song that ridiculed television advertisements about avoiding road fatalities and featured superb Beach Boys-style harmonies), "All Homeboys are Dickheads," and "(He'll Never Be An) Ol' Man River." The latter featured some of the more tasteless TISM lyrics for some time ("I'm on the drug that killed River Phoenix"). Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the song became hugely popular.

Two years later, in 1998, TISM re-appeared with another album of dance music-inspired anarchy. This record, entitled www.tism.wanker.com, did not receive flattering reviews and failed to match the success of its predecessor. Several singles became minor hits, including "Whatareya?" (which attempted to divide Australian men into two categories - "yobs" and "wankers") and "Thunderbirds Are Coming Out." A third single, "I Might Be a C***, but I'm Not a F****** C***," was released, but, not surprisingly, was not picked up by radio.

Triakel is a Swedish folk band. They mostly perform old Swedish folk songs, particularly those from the Jämtland area, but also include songs by contemporary folk artists.

Triakel was founded in 1995 by Emma Härdelin (Garmarna), Kjell-Erik Eriksson (Hoven Droven) and Janne Strömstedt (former Hoven Droven member); Eriksson and Strömstedt had to perform together using only the fiddle and harmonium on New Year's Eve 1994 following a lost bet, and the performance was so successful that they decided to continue with the project. Härdelin later on joined the newly formed band as the singer, and the name "Triakel" (a kind of sweet, black liquorice in the Swedish dialect of Jämtland; the word is etymologically related to the English "treacle") was chosen after a long discussion.

Vetiver
-------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vetiver-mn0000208893[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vetiver-mn0000208893+]

Based around the rootsy and searching songwriting of bandleader Andy Cabic, Vetiver was included in the earliest waves of the freak folk movement due to their strong ties to fellow Bay Area artists like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. The group slowly established a solid lineup as Cabic's songwriting continually evolved, moving from more traditional folky beginnings to include more electronic and rock elements by the time of 2015's Complete Strangers. 

Cabic got his start in the D.I.Y. indie rock scene forming his band Raymond Brake in his native Greensboro, North Carolina, in the early '90s. The Raymond Brake's noisy, Sonic Youth-influenced take on indie rock was a natural fit with both the Chapel Hill art-punk scene and the influential Washington, D.C.-based indie label Simple Machines, which released the band's debut album, Piles of Dirty Winters, in 1995. After a handful of EPs and one more album, 1996's Never Work Ever, the Raymond Brake broke up and Cabic migrated westward, eventually settling in San Francisco. 

While studying at the San Francisco Art Institute, Cabic met fellow student Banhart and instantly established a close working relationship with him. Playing shows with Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Six Organs of Admittance, and others, Cabic started writing songs for his new project, Vetiver, named for a relative of lemongrass that's used in perfume making. He added Banhart on guitar and backing vocals, Jim Gaylord on violin, and Alissa Anderson on cello, and the band -- with Cabic's vocals, banjo, and acoustic guitar -- released its self-titled debut on the DiCristina label in 2004. (The album, produced by Thom Monahan of the Pernice Brothers, also included guest spots by Newsom, Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval, and former My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm O'Ciosoig.) As the freak folk movement gained steam and Banhart's worldwide acclaim grew, Vetiver's association with him would bring them new fans as well. In addition to Banhart's musical contributions to Vetiver's albums, Cabic co-wrote Banhart's breakout song "At the Hop," and Banhart paid tribute to his friend's band in the song "When the Sun Shone on Vetiver." 

Vetiver was followed in 2005 by an odds-and-sods collection called Between, which included two live tracks, a new version of a song from Vetiver, and a cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Save Me a Place." For Vetiver's second full-length album, 2006's To Find Me Gone, Cabic finally added a drummer, Otto Hauser, and bassist Kevin Barker to the core trio of himself, Banhart, and Anderson. After the album was released, Cabic introduced a stable, full-time recording and touring lineup of himself, Anderson, Hauser, new guitarist Sanders Trippe, and new bassist Brent Dunn. In 2008, the band released A Thing of the Past, a collection of covers of songs by artists who had influenced the group's music, including Michael Hurley, Ronnie Lane, and Townes Van Zandt. 

The band's next album, Tight Knit, was released by Sub Pop in 2009, and Vetiver remained with that label for 2011's The Errant Charm, whose breezy, casual sound was inspired by Cabic's frequent walks around San Francisco's Richmond District. He returned in 2015 with sixth album Complete Strangers, again produced by sole Vetiver producer Thom Monahan. The album found Cabic integrating more electronic sounds into his laid-back folksy songwriting. After touring extensively with the full band in support of the album, Cabic embarked on several stripped-down tours with longtime friend Eric D. Johnson of Fruit Bats. These intimate shows would find both songwriters on stage, trading songs and backing each other up with just two acoustic guitars and supportive harmonies. The chemistry between the two was warm and captivating, and the shows were a big enough hit with fans that during a morning off on one of these tours, the duo took to a studio and tracked six songs in this minimal style. The session resulted in an EP entitled In Real Life (Live at Spacebomb Studios), which was released jointly under the name of both bands in early 2019. Before the year was up, the seventh Vetiver album, Up on High, materialized. Informed by several moves, the album returned to the more folksy and organic tones of earlier Vetiver material.

Vienna Art Orchestra
--------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Art_Orchestra[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Art_Orchestra+]

The Vienna Art Orchestra was a European jazz group based in Vienna, Austria. Organized at different times as either a big band or as a smaller combo, it was regarded as one of the leading European jazz ensembles and was an official cultural ambassador of the Republic of Austria. 

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vienna-art-orchestra-mn0000209389[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vienna-art-orchestra-mn0000209389+]]

In the jazz world, Vienna is about as far from New York's Lincoln Center as you can get. It follows that Mathias Rüegg's Vienna Art Orchestra has about as much in common with Wynton Marsalis' Lincoln Center big band as a Sacher torte has with a Hostess Cup Cake; while they share some ingredients, the Austrian product satisfies on a more profound level. By the turn of the century, the Lincoln Center paradigm defined the jazz big band as a finished concept -- locked into the past, serving mostly as a repertory ensemble. The VAO, on the other hand, while hardly ignoring traditional jazz verities, lives in the present and looks to the future. Rather than relying on a narrowly interpreted version of jazz history, they make their own, combining elements of jazz (mainstream through avant-garde), classical (Erik Satie is a Rüegg favorite), and vernacular music with intelligence and not a little humor. Rüegg was born in Zurich, Switzerland. He discovered jazz in secondary school and he moved to Austria and attended the Musikhochschule in Graz in the early 70s. He moved to Vienna and worked as a solo pianist in a nightclub. Solo became a duo with the addition of saxophonist Wolfgang Puschnig. The ensemble grew further; eventually it was comprised of as many as 16 musicians, and the VAO was born. The band never adhered to conventional big band instrumentation. Rüegg regularly incorporates instruments such as marimba, bass clarinet, piccolo, tuba, and even alphorn into his arrangements and compositions. Neither does the band stick to a typical performance format; for example, they've worked with choirs and brass bands, for television and film. By 1980, the band had developed a reputation, receiving invitations to perform at festivals in Cologne and Zurich; that year, the band also signed their first recording contract with the Swiss hatART label. In 1984, they toured the U.S. and finished first in the Down Beat magazine critics' poll for Talent Deserving Wider Recognition. By the late '80s, they were firmly established as one of the world's finest large ensembles, a status they maintained into the next century. Rüegg was the band's sole writer for the first 15 years of its existence. In 1992, he began contracting work to other composers and arrangers, although the band continued to bear his indelible stamp.

Waco Brothers
-------------

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/waco-brothers-mn0000923284/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/waco-brothers-mn0000923284/biography+]

Often described as "Half Cash, half Clash" for their fiery mixture of classic country spirit ("Cash" meaning the Man in Black) and old-school punk energy and defiance, the Waco Brothers were the most successful of the many side projects launched by Jon Langford, one of the founding members of eclectic British punk-and-beyond troublemakers the Mekons. Playing tough, defiant music with the rebellious (and often fiercely political) worldview of punk, the Wacos also added mandolin, steel guitar, and melodies that were clearly drawn from vintage honky tonk sounds, and if their take on country music was not designed to please purists, their passion was clear enough to persuade anyone that their love of country music was genuine. The group first hit their stride on their second album, 1997's Cowboy in Flames, and 2000's Electric Waco Chair, and 2002's New Deal were nearly up to its high standard, while 2012's Great Chicago Fire was a tough but melodic collaboration with Paul Burch. 

In the 80s, the Mekons began exploring the influences of American country music, which they had discovered while touring the United States, and the results were heard on the albums Fear and Whiskey (1985) and Honky Tonkin' (1987). Langford in particular was fascinated by the music of Johnny Cash; in 1988, he helped coordinate a U.K. compilation album, 'Til Things Are Brighter: A Tribute to Johnny Cash, and in 1994, he released Misery Loves Company: The World of Johnny Cash, a collection of covers credited to Johnny Langford & the Pine Valley Cosmonauts. 

After Langford relocated to the United States and settled in Chicago, Illinois, he wanted to form a band to play club shows in town, mostly in the interest of fun and free beer. Langford assembled a group heavy on fellow U.K. expatriates -- Langford on guitar and vocals, Alan Doughty (ex-Jesus Jones) on bass, Tracey Dear on mandolin and vocals, Mark Durante (of KMFDM and Revolting Cocks) on steel guitar, and Steve Goulding (who worked with the Mekons and Graham Parker & the Rumour) on drums, with token native Chicagoan Dean Schlabowske (of Wreck and Dollar Store) on guitar and vocals. Meanwhile, Langford had struck up a friendship with Rob Miller and Nan Warshaw, two fans of both punk and country music who were starting their own record label, and in 1994, the same year the Waco Brothers began playing out, Langford contributed two songs to Bloodshot Records' first release, For a Life of Sin -- a solo recording of his song "Over the Cliff," and a version of the Mekons' "Hole in the Ground" credited to Iggy Yoakam & His Famous Pogo Ponies. (Langford also provided the album's cover artwork.) 

While the Waco Brothers initially had no intention of recording, as their local following grew and Bloodshot provided the band a friendly home, they cut an album in 1995, To the Last Dead Cowboy. The album sold reasonably well and reviews were good, so they returned in 1997 with Cowboy in Flames. The album's sales far outstripped those of the debut, and the Waco Brothers became one of the leading acts on Chicago's thriving alt-country scene. While most of the group's members, like Langford, were also busy with other projects, the Wacos still played Chicago on a regular basis, launched short tours when they were of a mind, and released a steady stream of albums. The Wacos dropped four studio albums between 1999 and 2005 (Wacoworld, Electric Waco Chair, New Deal, and Freedom and Weep), all of which featured the group's hot-wired fusion of country and punk, welded to lyrics that offered a leftist spin on working-class politics. The year 2005 also brought a collaboration with pianist Dave Herndon, Nine Slices of My Mid-Life Crisis, and in 2008 the band finally documented its live show on CD with Waco Express: Live & Kickin' at Schuba's Tavern. 

The Waco Brothers' next album was another collaboration, Great Chicago Fire, in which they teamed up with celebrated singer and songwriter Paul Burch. The album also documented a new Waco Brothers lineup, as Mark Durante left the band and Steve Goulding returned to the reunited Graham Parker & the Rumour; Joe Camarillo, of Number Nine and Gear, took over Goulding's place behind the drums. In 2016, the Wacos released their first studio album of new material from the band in over a decade, Going Down in History, which found the band in stripped-down and fiery form; they supported the album with a short tour, which included several shows in Texas for the South by Southwest Music Conference and, of course, a handful of gigs in Illinois. Reflecting the mood of the United States, February 2020 saw the release of Resist! on Bloodshot, a vinyl-only collection of the group's most rebellious political numbers.

Wayne Hancock

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Hancock[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Hancock+]

Thomas Wayne Hancock III (born May 1, 1965 in Dallas, Texas) better known as Wayne "The Train" Hancock, is an American singer-songwriter. Hancock is known as "The King of Juke Joint Swing," because his sound is unique, as he incorporates jazz, big band, western swing, country and rockabilly, styles of music that he began listening to as a kid. His influences include Jimmie Rodgers, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Hank Thompson, Hank Williams and Hank Snow because they were all in his parents' record collection.[1]

Throughout his childhood, Hancock moved around seven times because his father was a Design engineer who worked at various engineering firms around the United States. Shortly after discovering country music, Hancock began writing songs at the age of twelve. Hancock's vocal style was initially influenced by Hank Williams, and he has been compared to him throughout his career.[1]

At eighteen years old, Hancock won the Wrangler Country Showdown contest. The son of a WWII veteran, Hancock joined the United States Marine Corps immediately after winning the contest and was shipped to recruit training. Hancock served in the military for four years. During a six-month deployment at Camp Hansen in Okinawa, Japan, he wrote wrote one of his most well known songs, "Cold Lonesome Wind" from Thunderstorms and Neon Signs.[1]

In 1990, Hancock moved to Austin, Texas. In 1994, he met Lubbock, Texas native Joe Ely, a member of the Flatlanders at the Continental Club in, Austin, Texas. Shortly thereafter, Hancock landed a role in Terry Allen and Jo Harvey Allen's play, Chippy. Jimmie Dale Gilmore of the Flatlanders originally played Hancock's character Mr. Jukebox. When Gilmore was unable to do the second run of the play, Ely brought Hancock in, saying "This guy sounds just like Hank Williams, he'd be perfect." From there, Hancock joined the cast and went into the studio to record "Thunderstorms and Neon Signs," for the soundtrack. It was his first recording of the song.[1]

Hancock met Grammy Award winning producer, pedal steel player, and Lubbock, Texas native, Lloyd Maines when Maines was running sound for Chippy. Maines has produced all of Hancock's albums, dating back to his 1995 debut, Thunderstorms and Neon Signs, released on Deja Disc Records. The album sold 22,000 copies in the first year. The follow up was Hancock's sophomore 1997 album, That's What Daddy Wants released on Ark 21 Records.[1]

On his debut 1999 album, Risin' Outlaw, Hank Williams III, grandson of Hank Williams Sr., covered two songs from Thunderstorms and Neon Signs, the title track, and "Why Don't You Leave Me Alone." He also recorded "87 Southbound," from That's What Daddy Wants.[1]

In April 2014, Hancock was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him with a fractured elbow and a collapsed lung. He was forced to cancel several months' worth of tour dates due to the wreck, but by the end of the year he was fully recovered and back on the road. In 2016, Hancock returned to the studio with producer Lloyd Maines to cut his eighth studio album Slingin' Rhythm.

Alternative country favorite Wayne Hancock is that rare breed of traditionalist: one who imbues his retro obsessions with such high energy and passion that his songs never feel like museum pieces he's trying desperately to preserve. Hancock is most often compared to Hank Williams, and he can indeed be a hardcore honky tonker, but there's more to him than that: he also displays a genuine affinity for stomping rockabilly, Western swing, blues, and old-timey country à la Jimmie Rodgers. Plus, he also throws in the occasional pop standard in the manner of Willie Nelson's classic Stardust album. Hancock's devotion to classic country sounds, coupled with his strong aversion to the Nashville hit-making machine, earned him an ardent following among alternative country fans (from both the country and rock sides of the movement), as well as a fair amount of critical acclaim. 

Wayne "The Train" Hancock was born May 1, 1965, and began writing songs around age 12. His family moved around a lot during his childhood, and often sang to entertain themselves. Hancock started playing juke joints around Texas as a teenager, and at age 18 won a prestigious talent competition, the Wrangler Country Showdown; however, he was unable to reap the benefits, having just enlisted in the Marines. After six years in the military, Hancock returned to Texas and began playing around the state wherever he could, working odd jobs on the side to help make ends meet. Eventually tiring of his itinerant existence, Hancock moved to West Dallas in 1993, and shortly thereafter settled in the music mecca of Austin. In 1994, he got a part in the musical theater production Chippy, where he performed alongside progressive country legends Joe Ely, Butch Hancock (no relation), Robert Earl Keen, and Terry Allen. He also made his recorded debut on the soundtrack album Songs from Chippy. 

Thanks to that bit of exposure, Hancock was able to score a deal with the small Texas indie label Deja Disc. His debut album, Thunderstorms and Neon Signs, was produced by steel guitar legend Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. Critics fawned over the album, particularly the Hank Williams-ish title track, and despite being on a tiny label with limited distribution, it sold over 20,000 copies, mostly through word of mouth. Its success attracted the attention of the somewhat larger indie Ark 21, which signed Hancock for his second album, That's What Daddy Wants. Issued in 1997, the record found Hancock employing elaborate, horn-driven arrangements and delving more deeply into rockabilly and Western swing, which earned some comparisons to the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Reviews were again highly positive, and Ark 21 accordingly reissued Hancock's debut. His third album, Wild, Free & Reckless, had more traditional country instrumentation, full of fiddles and steel guitars, and accordingly was more reminiscent of pre-rock & roll country boogie. 

Hancock subsequently switched to the alt-country hub Bloodshot Records, debuting in 2001 with A-Town Blues, which continued the more stripped-down approach of his most recent music. That same year he released the limited-edition EP South Austin Sessions. Hancock dug even deeper into his honky tonk roots with his next album, 2003's Swing Time, recorded live during a two-night stand at the Continental Club in Austin. In 2006, Hancock turned in Tulsa, his third full-length recording for Bloodshot, with Lloyd Maines remaining in the producer's chair. A fourth album for the label, Viper of Melody, appeared in 2009. His next release, Ride, showed up early in 2013, again from Bloodshot. In April 2014, Hancock was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him with a fractured elbow and a collapsed lung. He was forced to cancel several months' worth of tour dates due to the wreck, but by the end of the year he was fully recovered and back on the road. In 2016, Hancock returned to the studio with producer Lloyd Maines to cut his eighth studio album Slingin' Rhythm.

William Elliott Whitmore
------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Elliott_Whitmore[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Elliott_Whitmore+]

William Elliott Whitmore (born May 11, 1978) is an American blues, country, folk singer and musician.[1][2] He plays roots-folk music that is often inspired by his life on his family farm in the hills of southeastern Iowa.

With a voice that sounds like the reincarnation of an old gospel preacher from the 1920s, and a fascination with sin, death, and redemption to match, William Elliott Whitmore's songs recall the particularly raw qualities of vintage 20th century blues songs, holler moans, and gospel shouts recorded in the early 20th century in the field. That said, his songs are often delivered with the raw energy and emotional immediacy of punk. Beginning with 2003's Hymns for the Hopeless, Whitmore's ragged crow-croak of a voice comes from the mysterious place where blues and gospel first converged to become country. In addition to playing his banjo and stompbox, he is a more than passable guitarist who is never less than proficient at accompanying himself. He signed to Anti- for 2009's Animals in the Dark, and delivered three acclaimed albums for the label. He switched gears for 2015's Radium Death by employing a full band. He signed with Bloodshot for 2018's eclectic all-covers set Kilonova. 

Born the son of a farmer, Whitmore was raised on a horse farm on the banks of the Mississippi River outside of Keokuk, Iowa. His songs have a stark universality that is sketched out with minimal instrumentation, usually just a banjo or guitar and a smattering of percussion. Whitmore is rumored to have gotten his start in the music business by working as a roadie for Iowa hardcore band Ten Grand, famous for their fast and furious 20-minute sets -- Whitmore frequently stepped in with his own songs to fill out the time. His voice is like a cross between Captain Beefheart and Dock Boggs, and his folk- and blues-inflected songs feel like they've been left out in the rain for months, weathered and tightened to the snapping point. 

Whitmore released Hymns for the Hopeless on Southern in 2003, followed by Ashes to Dust, also on Southern, in 2005. He appeared on the 2006 compilation Let's Be Active along with two other artists. In 2006, Whitmore released a third album on Southern, the characteristically stark (and critically acclaimed) Song of the Blackbird. Animals in the Dark followed in 2009. Whitmore toured extensively in late 2009 and for much of 2010, and saw his reputation as a songwriter increase, as he played for ever larger audiences. He returned to recording in early 2011 with another stripped-down set entitled Field Songs, which was released by Anti- in July of that year. He undertook a tour with Low Anthem and James Vincent McMorrow before embarking on his own headlining tour, which took him everywhere from small clubs to folk festival stages. 

But Whitmore never gave up farming. With a desire to change-up his process, he began writing songs in 2013 and traveling two hours to work with producer Luke Tweedy in Iowa City over the next year-and-a-half. The end result was Radium Death, an album that, while retaining Whitmore's hard folk roots, was fleshed out by full-on rock band arrangements. Anti- released the set in March of 2015. After touring with a full band, Whitmore went back to playing solo, farming, and thinking about where to go next. He left Anti- for Bloodshot in 2017 and re-entered the studio to cut his dream project: A covers album entitled Kilonova. The ten-song set included solo acoustic versions of songs he'd covered in concert, ranging from the first single, "Fear of Trains," by Magnetic Fields to Harlan Howard's "Busted," Bad Religion's "Don't Pray on Me," Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine," and Captain Beefheart's "Bat Chain Puller." Kilonova was released in the fall of 2018. 

Wurzels
-------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wurzels[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wurzels+]]

The Wurzels are a Scrumpy and Western band from Somerset, England, best known for their number one hit "The Combine Harvester" and number three hit "I Am A Cider Drinker" in 1976.[1] They are known for using British West Country phrases "ooh arr!" and call young people "young'uns" in songs like I am a Cider Drinker[2] and Combine Harvester.

The name of the band was dreamt up by founder Adge Cutler. It appears to be short for mangelwurzel, a crop grown to feed livestock, and wurzel is also sometimes used in the UK (perhaps only as a result of the band's name) as a synonym for yokel.[4]

The Wurzels' particular "genre" of music was named Scrumpy and Western after the group's first EP of the same name, issued early in 1967. Scrumpy is a name given to traditionally-made rough cider in southwest England,[5] popular amongst The Wurzels and their fans, and frequently referred to in their songs.

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-wurzels-mn0000941024/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-wurzels-mn0000941024/biography+]

Formed in 1966 by singer/songwriter Adge Cutler, British country-folk/novelty outfit the Wurzels wrote, performed, and recorded rustic and occasionally comedic tunes (and reworkings of whatever songs were popular at the time) teeming with the industrial and rural images of their West Country farming communities, specifically the drinking of cider. Originally conceived as a backing band for Cutler before his death in 1974, the band hit it big in 1976 with "Combine Harvester," a parody of Melanie's "Brand New Key." The song sat atop the U.K. pop charts for two weeks, resulting in a string of similarly successful outings like "I Am a Cider Drinker" and "Farmer Bill's Cowman." The group fell beneath the pop culture radio in the 1980s, but never stopped recording and performing. New manager Sil Willcox (the Stranglers) brought with him a brief resurgence in the mid-'90s with the Wurzels' collection of British rock covers, Never Mind the Bullocks. The veteran group appeared on a split single with enigmatic Brit-pop revivalists British Sea Power in 2005, and remain quite popular in their West Country homeland.

Ye Banished Privateers
----------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Banished_Privateers[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Banished_Privateers+]

Ye Banished Privateers are a pirate folk rock band from Umeå, Sweden.[2]

Their songs are inspired by traditional Irish and Scandinavian folk music and their lyrics are mostly based on events that happened in the 17th and 18th century.[3][4] During their shows they portray a crew of pirates, wearing historical clothes and acting while playing, making the show itself a mix of music and theatre.

http://yebanishedprivateers.com/[+http://yebanishedprivateers.com/+]

YE BANISHED PRIVATEERS takes you 300 years back in time for an imaginary journey through the harsh life at sea during the early 18th century. With songs inspired by traditional Irish and Scandinavian folk music, acting and elaborate historical clothing the privateers tell a story about the rough sailor’s life, lived on the other side of the law– and the fight against oppression and nationalism.

Together, the nearly 30 crew members take turns to go on tour and plunder, and with around a dozen sailors on stage no two shows are ever the same. The mix of rude folk and punk music invites you to dance and sing along, while the gripping ballads will make the toughest pirate heart soft.

Zoogz Rift
----------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoogz_Rift[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoogz_Rift+]

The Trouser Press describes Zoogz Rift as "an iconoclastic original" who is "as imaginative and stimulating as he is irritating and vitriolic."[3] Rift was influenced by Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart as well as Salvador Dalí and Ayn Rand.[3] Zoogz Rift began his recording career with the album Idiots on the Miniature Golf Course, released by Snout Records in 1979. His long-time collaborators included Richie Häss and John Trubee (the latter being famous for the songshark tune, "A Blind Man's Penis"). Rift released several albums through SST Records during the 1980s.[4] Richard Gehr, writing for Spin, noted that by the time of 1985's Interim Resurgence, Rift had completed a transition from "Zappa sycophancy" to "a conceptual continuity of his very own."[5] Keyboard Magazine, in a special "Experimental Music" issue, described Rift's album The Island of Living Puke as "moments of outstanding free-form rock, sandwiched between scrupulously obscene interruptions."`

Part Beefheart, part Manson, part who-the-fuck-knows-what, Zoogz Rift was built for cult status. From mad-eyed Farfisa punk and slabs of abstract noise to sinister, acid-addled monologues and even a vicious dismantling of Cream’s Sunshine of Your Love, his madness was compelling and unique.

https://www.allmusic.com/artist/zoogz-rift-mn0000189544/biography[+https://www.allmusic.com/artist/zoogz-rift-mn0000189544/biography+]

"Another in the line of eccentric rock experimentalists led by Zappa and Beefheart, Zoogz Rift was influenced by those two as well as figures artistic (Dali) and literary/sociological (Ayn Rand, author of the objectivist pillar Atlas Shrugged). Born in New Jersey but later a resident of California, Rift began recording in the 1979 with Idiots on the Miniature Golf Course, for Snout Records. The album began a long association with his two major collaborators, Richie Häss and John Van Zelm Trubee (also a member of the Ugly Janitors of America), and proved similar to the zany freak-out of Beefheart, to whom it's dedicated. Much of Zoogz Rift's eccentricities began to be overwhelmed by his growing musical ability in the mid-'80s, and though albums like Amputees in Limbo, Island of Living Puke and the three volumes included in the Water trilogy were hardly commercial propositions, they found Rift embracing synthesizers and samplers as well as the traditional guitars. His last LP in a long series for the punk label SST Records was 1989's Torment, after which Rift recorded for Trigon and the German label Musical Tragedies."
