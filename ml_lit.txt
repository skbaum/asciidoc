=== *The Secrets of Machine Learning: Ten Things You WIsh You Had Known Earlier to be More Effective at Data Analysis* - C. Rudin and D. Carlson (2019)

https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01998[`https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01998`]

* There are at least four main families of machine learning models
for supervised learning

** logical models (decision trees, rule-based models)
** linear combinations of trees, stumps or other kinds of features (logistic regression, boosting, random
forests, additive models)
** case-based reasoning (K-nearest neighbors, kernel based methods, e.g. support vector machines with
Gaussian kernels, kernel regression
** iterative summation (neural networks)

* All machine learning methods perform similarly

*****
"Neural networks seem to perform significantly better on many computer vision tasks than other
machine learning methods."

"Surprisingly, there appears to be no practical significant difference in performance between
machine learning methods for a huge number of data science problems."

"Adding more data, adding domain knowledge, or improving the quality of data, can often often
be much more valuable than switching algorithms or changing tuning parameters."

"Adding in domain knowledge in various ways can sometimes be more powerful than anything else."

"If you have classification or regression data with inherently meaningful covariates, then try
several different algorithms.  If several of them all perform similarly after parameter tuning,
use the simplest or most meaningful model."

"Neural networks would almost never be the first approach to try on a new
dataset, as their training is finicky and difficult, and they tend to be black boxes that are
difficult to understand and troubleshoot."
*****

* Neural networks are hard to train and weird stuff happens

* If you don't use and interpretable model, you can make bad mistakes

*****
"How
do we know that a complex black box trained on a static dataset in a particular controlled
environment is going to behave as we expect when launched in the wild? Conversely, how
do we know our algorithm is not picking up on confounding signals? Recently in a study
of deep neural networks on xray images, the networks were found to be looking at some
writing indicating the type of xray equipment rather than at the actual medical content
of the xray."

"For high stakes decisions,
black box models should not be used unless absolutely necessary, and it is unclear that
it is ever actually necessary to use a black box machine learning model – for high stakes
decisions, one should always aim to construct an interpretable model that is as accurate as
the black box."
*****

* Explanations can be misleading and we cannot trust them

*****
"An
“explanation” is a separate interpretable model that approximates the predictions of a black
box model. The problem with these explanations is that they do not actually explain what
the black box is doing, they are instead summary statistics of the predictions."
*****

* It is generally possible to find an accurate-yet-interpretable model, even for neural networks

*****
"It is possible to produce an interpretable model that
is approximately as accurate as the best available black box. However, creating an accurate
interpretable model can be much more complicated than creating an accurate black box."

"There is no reason to
expect there to be a single performance measure of interpretability, since there is not a single
performance measure for prediction performance across domains; accuracy, false positive
rate, area under the ROC curve, F-score, discounted cumulative gain, etc., are performance
measures used in various domains."
*****

* Special properties such as decision making, fairness, or robustness must be built in

* Causal inference is different than prediction (correlation is not causation)

* There is a method to the madness of deep neural network architectures, but not always

*****
"The fundamental idea of an RNN is that the architecture contains both layers to build
depth at each entry in the sequence, but also connections to the past."

"Overall, neural network architectures may seem to be a smorgasbord of possibilities,
but network structures are becoming more standard with the ability to relatively easily
swap out network components for alternative network components or building blocks."
*****

* It is a myth that machine learning can do anything

*****
"Performance on the famous machine learning benchmarks, while incredibly impressive, is largely
evaluated on testing data that is nearly identical in distribution to the training data."

"Generative models (i.e. models that can generate data samples that look like the
observed data) have been constructed in recent years based on adversarial learning.
The key idea to adversarial learning is to construct two separate networks, the generator
and the discriminator, and have them compete against each other."

"In essence, machine learning methods can be very useful, but, as of this moment, they
can do only what we train them to do, which is to recognize and repeat patterns in data."

"Deep learning performs remarkably well on many time series analysis tasks recently. The superior performance of deep neural networks relies heavily on a large number of training data to avoid overfitting. However, the labeled data of many real-world time series applications may be limited such as classification in medical time series and anomaly detection in AIOps. As an effective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data, data augmentation is crucial to the successful application of deep learning models on time series data. In this paper, we systematically review different data augmentation methods for time series. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review for these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also empirically compare different data augmentation methods for different tasks including time series anomaly detection, classification and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and highlight future research directions, including data augmentation in time-frequency domain, augmentation combination, and data augmentation and weighting for imbalanced class."

"Diverse subfields of neuroscience have enriched artificial intelligence for many decades. With recent advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks, many neuroscientists are partnering with AI researchers and machine learning experts to analyze data and construct models. This paper attempts to demonstrate the value of such collaborations by providing examples of how insights derived from neuroscience research are helping to develop new machine learning algorithms and artificial neural network architectures. We survey the relevant neuroscience necessary to appreciate these insights and then describe how we can translate our current understanding of the relevant neurobiology into algorithmic techniques and architectural designs. Finally, we characterize some of the major challenges facing current AI technology and suggest avenues for overcoming these challenges that draw upon research in developmental and comparative cognitive neuroscience."

==== *70 years of machine learning in geoscience in review* (2020) - J. S. Dramsch

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13311[`https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13311`]

*****
"This review gives an overview of the development of machine learning in geoscience. A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science."

"Statistical learning theory provides the foundation to applied machine learning, and its various successful applications in computer vision, natural language processing and other scientific domains. The theory, however, does not take into account the unique challenges of performing statistical learning in geospatial settings. For instance, it is well known that model errors cannot be assumed to be independent and identically distributed in geospatial (a.k.a. regionalized) variables due to spatial correlation; and trends caused by geophysical processes lead to covariate shifts between the domain where the model was trained and the domain where it will be applied, which in turn harm the use of classical learning methodologies that rely on random samples of the data. In this work, we introduce the geostatistical (transfer) learning problem, and illustrate the challenges of learning from geospatial data by assessing widely-used methods for estimating generalization error of learning models, under covariate shift and spatial correlation. Experiments with synthetic Gaussian process data as well as with real data from geophysical surveys in New Zealand indicate that none of the methods are adequate for model selection in a geospatial context. We provide general guidelines regarding the choice of these methods in practice while new methods are being actively researched."

"The field of fluid mechanics is rapidly advancing, driven by unprecedented volumes of data from experiments, field measurements, and large-scale simulations at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations. ML provides a powerful information-processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications."

* Introduction

* Overview of  geoscience data

* Geoscience properties

*****
"While spatio-temporal auto-correlation ensures
strong connectivity among observations in close vicinity of
space and time, a unique aspect of geoscience processes is
that they also show long-range spatial and temporal dependencies."

"Geoscience processes also show long-memory
memory characteristics in time, e.g., the effect of climate
indices such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on global
floods, droughts, and forest fires."

"The Earth system is not stationary
in time and goes through many cycles, ranging from
seasonal and decadal cycles to long-term geological changes
(e.g., glaciation, polarity reversals) and even climate change
phenomena, that impact all local processes."

"The form, structure,
and patterns of geoscience objects and events are
much more complex than those found in discrete spaces
that ML algorithms typically deal with, such as items in
market basket data."

"In a number of geoscience problems, we are interested in
studying objects, processes, and events that occur infrequently
in space and time but have major impacts on our
society and the Earth’s ecosystem. ... These processes may relate to
emergent (or anomalous) states of the Earth system, or other
features of complex systems such as anomalous state trajectories
and basins of attractions."
*****

* Geoscience applications for ML

** Detecting objects and events

*****
"Detecting objects and events in geoscience
data is important for a number of reasons. For example,
detecting spatial and temporal patterns in climate data can
help in tracking the formation and movement of objects such
as cyclones, weather fronts, atmospheric rivers, and ocean
eddies, which are responsible for the transfer of precipitation,
energy, and nutrients in the atmosphere and ocean."

"There is a need to develop novel pattern
mining approaches that can account for the spatial and
temporal properties of objects and events, e.g., spatial
coherence and temporal persistence, that can work with
amorphous boundaries."
*****

** Estimating geoscience variables

*****
"An important category of geoscience
problems where ML can contribute is to estimate physical
variables that are difﬁcult to monitor directly, e.g., methane
concentrations in air or groundwater seepage in soil, using
information about other observed or simulated variables."

"The combined effects of heterogeneity, paucity of
labeled data, and rare classes make it difﬁcult for standard
ML algorithms to achieve good prediction performance."

"Another challenge for ML algorithms is the poor quality of
geoscience data due to noise and missing values, that
increases the risks of spurious estimates. ... Geosci-
ence data show novel types of structured noise and missing
values that are uncommon in other domains."

*A Survey of Deep Active Learning* (2020) - https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00236[`https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00236`]

* Long-term forecasting of geoscience variables

*****
"From a
machine learning perspective, the problem of forecasting
can be treated as a time-series regression problem where
the future conditions of a geoscience variable have to be predicted
based on present and past conditions."

"A key challenge in predicting the long-term
trends of geoscience variables is to develop approaches that
can represent and propagate prediction uncertainties, which
is particularly difﬁcult given the small sample size (limited
number of years with reliable historical records) faced in
geoscience applications and the non-stationary nature of geoscience
processes."
*****

* Mining relationships in geoscience data

*****
"An important problem in geoscience
applications is to understand how different physical processes
are related to each other, e.g., periodic changes in the
sea surface temperature over eastern Pacific Ocean - also
known as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation - and their
impact on several terrestrial events such as ﬂoods, droughts,
and forest fires."

"Another family of approaches for
mining relationships in climate science is based on represent-
ing climate graphs as complex networks."

"Causality-based
networks, based typically on either the framework of Granger
causality or of Pearl causality can be used to detect
potential cause-effect relationships in geoscience applica-
tions."

"Methods for handling the high dimensionality of
geoscience data along with small sample sizes have also been
explored where sparsity-inducing regularizers such as
sparse group Lasso were developed to model the domain
characteristics of climate variables."

"The fact that multi-variate causality
tools based on VAR/LASSO or Pearl analysis, which have
yielded tremendous breakthroughs in biology and medicine
over the past decade, are still not commonly used in the
geosciences, is in stark contrast to the huge potential these
methods have for tackling numerous geoscience problems."

* Cross-cutting research themes

** Deep learning

*****
"Deep learning methods can be
used to detect geoscience objects and events, e.g., atmospheric
rivers and weather fronts, automatically from the
data as spatio-temporal patterns, without needing to build
hand-coded features."

"Deep learning
methods can also be used for estimating geoscience variables
from observations using supervised or semi-supervised
techiques."

"Deep learning based frameworks
have also been explored for downscaling outputs of Earth
system models and generating climate change projections at
local scales, and classifying objects such as trees and
buildings in high-resolution satellite images."

"A key challenge for deep learn-
ing in geoscience problems is the paucity of labeled samples
that limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised deep
learning frameworks. Hence, there is a need to develop novel
frameworks in deep learning that can work with limited num-
ber of labeled samples while leveraging the abundance of
unlabeled samples available in geoscience problems."
*****

** Theory-guided data science

*****
"Theory-guided data science is an emerging paradigm of
research that aims to combine scientiﬁc knowledge (or theory
with ML methods to advance knowledge discovery in
a number of scientiﬁc disciplines."

"It is important to adopt the paradigm of theory-guided
data science as an overarching philosophy in all applications
of ML methods in geoscience problems, so that we discover
patterns and relationships that are not only generalizable but
also consistent with our existing scientiﬁc knowledge."

*****
"This paper reviews the most important information fusion data-driven algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for problems in Earth observation. Nowadays we observe and model the Earth with a wealth of observations, from a plethora of different sensors, measuring states, fluxes, processes and variables, at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Earth observation is well equipped with remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites and airborne platforms, but it also involves in-situ observations, numerical models and social media data streams, among other data sources. Data-driven approaches, and ML techniques in particular, are the natural choice to extract significant information from this data deluge. This paper produces a thorough review of the latest work on information fusion for Earth observation, with a practical intention, not only focusing on describing the most relevant previous works in the field, but also the most important Earth observation applications where ML information fusion has obtained significant results. We also review some of the most currently used data sets, models and sources for Earth observation problems, describing their importance and how to obtain the data when needed. Finally, we illustrate the application of ML data fusion with a representative set of case studies, as well as we discuss and outlook the near future of the field."

In this manuscript, we provide a structured and comprehensive overview of techniques to integrate machine learning with physics-based modeling. First, we provide a summary of application areas for which these approaches have been applied. Then, we describe classes of methodologies used to construct physics-guided machine learning models and hybrid physics-machine learning frameworks from a machine learning standpoint. With this foundation, we then provide a systematic organization of these existing techniques and discuss ideas for future research.

"Over the past few years, we have seen fundamental breakthroughs in core problems in machine learning, largely driven by advances in deep neural networks. At the same time, the amount of data collected in a wide array of scientific domains is dramatically increasing in both size and complexity. Taken together, this suggests many exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings. But a significant challenge to this is simply knowing where to start. The sheer breadth and diversity of different deep learning techniques makes it difficult to determine what scientific problems might be most amenable to these methods, or which specific combination of methods might offer the most promising first approach. In this survey, we focus on addressing this central issue, providing an overview of many widely used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models --- two central considerations for many scientific use cases. We also include overviews of the full design process, implementation tips, and links to a plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community. We hope that this survey will help accelerate the use of deep learning across different scientific domains."

"Numerous deep learning architectures have been developed to accommodate the diversity of time series datasets across different domains. In this article, we survey common encoder and decoder designs used in both one-step-ahead and multi-horizon time series forecasting -- describing how temporal information is incorporated into predictions by each model. Next, we highlight recent developments in hybrid deep learning models, which combine well-studied statistical models with neural network components to improve pure methods in either category. Lastly, we outline some ways in which deep learning can also facilitate decision support with time series data."

"Machine learning (automated processes that learn by example in order to classify, predict, discover or generate new data) and artificial intelligence (methods by which a computer makes decisions or discoveries that would usually require human intelligence) are now firmly established in astronomy. Every week, new applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence are added to a growing corpus of work. Random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks (artificial, deep, and convolutional) are now having a genuine impact for applications as diverse as discovering extrasolar planets, transient objects, quasars, and gravitationally-lensed systems, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. This review surveys contemporary, published literature on machine learning and artificial intelligence in astronomy and astrophysics. Applications span seven main categories of activity: classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insight. These categories form the basis of a hierarchy of maturity, as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence emerges, progresses or becomes established."

"Understanding the principles of geophysical phenomena is an essential and challenging task. "Model-driven" approaches have supported the development of geophysics for a long time; however, such methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and may inaccurately model the subsurface. "Data-driven" techniques may overcome these issues with increasingly available geophysical data. In this article, we review the basic concepts of and recent advances in data-driven approaches from dictionary learning to deep learning in a variety of geophysical scenarios. Explorational geophysics including data processing, inversion and interpretation will be mainly focused. Artificial intelligence applications on geoscience involving deep Earth, earthquake, water resource, atmospheric science, satellite remoe sensing and space sciences are also reviewed. We present a coding tutorial and a summary of tips for beginners and interested geophysical readers to rapidly explore deep learning. Some promising directions are provided for future research involving deep learning in geophysics, such as unsupervised learning, transfer learning, multimodal deep learning, federated learning, uncertainty estimation, and activate learning."

"Within the past years, hardware vendors have started designing low precision special function units in response to the demand of the Machine Learning community and their demand for high compute power in low precision formats. Also the server-line products are increasingly featuring low-precision special function units, such as the NVIDIA tensor cores in ORNL's Summit supercomputer providing more than an order of magnitude higher performance than what is available in IEEE double precision. At the same time, the gap between the compute power on the one hand and the memory bandwidth on the other hand keeps increasing, making data access and communication prohibitively expensive compared to arithmetic operations. To start the multiprecision focus effort, we survey the numerical linear algebra community and summarize all existing multiprecision knowledge, expertise, and software capabilities in this landscape analysis report. We also include current efforts and preliminary results that may not yet be considered "mature technology," but have the potential to grow into production quality within the multiprecision focus effort. As we expect the reader to be familiar with the basics of numerical linear algebra, we refrain from providing a detailed background on the algorithms themselves but focus on how mixed- and multiprecision technology can help improving the performance of these methods and present highlights of application significantly outperforming the traditional fixed precision methods."
