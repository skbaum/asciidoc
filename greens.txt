Claytonia (Claytonia perfoliata)
--------------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytonia_perfoliata[`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytonia_perfoliata`]

"Claytonia perfoliata (syn. Montia perfoliata), also known as miner's lettuce, Indian lettuce, spring beauty, or winter purslane, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae. It is a fleshy, herbaceous, annual plant native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North America, from southernmost Alaska and central British Columbia, all the way south to Central America, but most common in California in the Sacramento and northern San Joaquin Valleys. 

Claytonia perfoliata is a tender rosette-forming plant that grows to a maximum of 40 centimetres (16 in) in height, but mature plants can be as short as 1 centimetre (0.39 in). The cotyledons are usually bright green (rarely purplish- or brownish-green), succulent, long and narrow. The first true leaves form a rosette at the base of the plant, and are 0.5 to 4 centimetres (0.20 to 1.57 in) long, with a typically long petiole (exceptionally up to 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long).

Claytonia perfoliata is common in the springtime, and prefers a cool, damp environment. The plant first appears in sunlit areas after the first heavy rains of the year, though the best stands are found in shaded areas, especially in the uplands, into early summer. As the days get hotter and drier, the leaves turn a deep red color as they dry out. 

The common name of miner's lettuce refers to how the plant was used by miners during the California Gold Rush, who ate it to prevent scurvy. It is in season in April and May, and can be eaten as a leaf vegetable. The entire plant, except the roots, is edible, and it provides vitamin C. Most commonly, it is eaten raw in salads, but it is not quite as delicate as cultivated lettuce. Sometimes, it is boiled like spinach, which it resembles in taste and chemical composition. Caution should be used because wild C. perfoliata can sometimes accumulate toxic amounts of soluble oxalates (also present in spinach).

"This cool-season salad green readily self-seeds and can overwinter in Zone 6 and warmer. While somewhat aggressive, it makes a handsome low-growing cover for edible landscaping."

Culantro (Eryngium foetidum)
----------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryngium_foetidum[`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryngium_foetidum`]

"Eryngium foetidum is a tropical perennial herb in the family Apiaceae.
Common names include culantro (/kuːˈlɑːntroʊ/ or /kuːˈlæntroʊ/), recao, shadow beni, Mexican coriander, bhandhania,
long coriander, sawtooth coriander, and ngò gai.
It is native to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, but is cultivated worldwide, sometimes being grown as an annual in temperate climates.

In the United States, the common name culantro sometimes causes confusion with cilantro, a common name for the leaves of Coriandrum sativum (also in Apiaceae), of which culantro is said to taste like a stronger version.

Eryngium foetidum is widely used in seasoning, marinating and garnishing in the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, Guyana, Suriname, and in Ecuador and Peru's Amazon regions. It is used extensively in Cambodia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and other parts of Asia as a culinary herb.[5] It dries well, retaining good color and flavor, making it valuable in the dried herb industry. It is sometimes used as a substitute for coriander, but it has a much stronger taste.

"Culantro is an herb that has a similar aroma and flavor to cilantro, but they are not the same plant. It has long, serrated leaves and looks a bit like long-leafed lettuce. Culantro has a stronger flavor than cilantro and is therefore used in smaller amounts. Unlike cilantro, it can be added during cooking rather than afterward. You will find culantro specified in recipes for dishes from the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and Asia.

Culantro (Eryngium foetidum) grows similar to lettuce, with leaves around a central rosette.
At the peak of its growth, a culantro plant can be 1 foot tall and the leaves as much as 2 inches wide, and it will produce a blue flower if permitted to bolt.
Culantro is a member Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, celery, parsley, and parsnip.
Culantro is used as both a culinary and medicinal herb.
In food, the leaves are often added during cooking because it has a very strong flavor and aroma, which diminishes nicely under heat."

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-506.html[`https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-506.html`]

"Culantro is native to continental tropical America and the West Indies (Adams 1971).
It grows naturally throughout many Caribbean islands including Trinidad and Tobago, where it is abundant in forests particularly in disturbed areas as in slash and burn sites.
The herb is also commonly found along moist or shaded pathways and near cultivated areas where heavy soils predominate (Seaforth et al. 1983; Morean 1988).
Although the plant grows well in full sun most commercial plantings occur in partially shaded moist locations.
Shaded areas produce plants with larger and greener leaves that are more marketable because of their better appearance and higher pungent aroma.
In a study on the effects of light intensity on growth and flowering of culantro,
a significant delay in flowering and increased fresh weight of leaves were found in plants grown under 63% to 73% shade (Santiago–Santos and Cedeno–Maldonado 1991).
Shaded plants also had fewer inflorescences with lower fresh weight.
Although culantro grows in a wide variety of soils, it does best in moist well drained sandy loams high in organic matter particularly under full light.
Precise fertilizer recommendations have not been made but high nitrogen fertilizers or manures promote leaf growth.
Plants are usually started from seed which germinate in about 30 days, and for home or backyard gardens can be cultivated in containers or wooden boxes.
For such cultivation, a slow release fertilizer such as Osmocote (14–14–14) can be incorporated in the soil mix at the rate of 1.8 kg/m3."

https://worldcrops.org/crops/culantro[`https://worldcrops.org/crops/culantro`]

"This aromatic herb has many common names, depending on the country where it is used.
In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic culantro appears to be the most common name,
but in addition the recao is used.
Other names are ngo gai in Vietnam, Culantro de Pata in Honduras, Culantro coyote in Costa, alcanate in El Salvador, coentro do Pará in Brazil, cilantro in Oaxaca Mexico, fitweed in Guyana, herbe à fer in Martinique and Guadeloupe), coulante Haiti, shado beni and bhandhania inTrinrinidad and Tobago. 

Eryngium foetidum belongs to the family Apiaceae which includes cilantro, carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), celery (Apium graveolens), and parsnip (Pastinaca sativa). Eryngium foetidum can be considered a biennial or a short-lived perennial.

Culantro is a tender perennial and is grown as an annual in the Northeastern US.
Due to the fact that it is frost sensitive and can take up to three weeks to germinate, even with bottom heat supplied at 75°F, transplants are recommended for the cultivation of Eryngium foetidum in the Northeast.
The plants should be set out after the danger of frost has passed.
Transplants are spaced 4 - 6 inches within the row and no closer than 6 inches apart between the rows.
It is recommended to use the same fertility you would use for leafy greens.

When culantro begins to produce flowers, the leaves become tough and less suitable for eating.
The harvest is achieved by cutting the entire rosette at soil level.
The flower stalks must be pruned regularly in order to maintain vegetative growth and maximize yields."

"Seeds can be sown at any time but are best sown in winter or early spring to benefit from a cold spell in the wet compost to break their dormancy. We advise covering seeds very thinly with sand or fine grit to about the depth of the seed size. If the seeds do not come up within 6 to 12 weeks the damp seed tray can be given cold treatment in a fridge for about four weeks. They may still take very many months to appear, so please never discard the pot or tray."

Lamb's Lettuce/Corn Salad (Valerianella locusta)
------------------------------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerianella_locusta[`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerianella_locusta`]

"Valerianella locusta is a small annual plant that is eaten as a leaf vegetable. It has a characteristic nutty flavour, dark green colour, and soft texture, and is popularly served as salad greens. Common names include corn salad, common cornsalad, lamb's lettuce, mâche (/mɑːʃ/), fetticus, feldsalat, nut lettuce, field salad. In restaurants that feature French cooking, it may be called doucette or raiponce, as an alternative to mâche, by which it is best known. In German-speaking Switzerland it is known as Nüsslisalat or Nüssler, terms that have been borrowed by the area's many English speakers. It is typically served as a salad with chopped hard-boiled eggs and crumbled bacon. 

Corn salad grows wild in parts of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia. In Europe and Asia it is a common weed in cultivated land and waste spaces. In North America it has escaped cultivation and become naturalized on both the eastern and western seaboards.

As a cultivated crop, it is a specialty of the region around Nantes, France, which is the primary producer of mâche in Europe.

Corn salad was originally foraged by European peasants. Jean-Baptiste de La Quintinie [fr], royal gardener of King Louis XIV, introduced it to kitchen gardening. It has been eaten in Britain for centuries and appears in John Gerard's Herbal of 1597. It was grown commercially in London from the late 18th or early 19th century and appeared on markets as a winter vegetable, but it only became available in modern supermarkets there in the 1980s. American president Thomas Jefferson cultivated mâche at his home, Monticello, in Virginia in the early 1800s.

The common name corn salad refers to the fact that it often grows as a weed in cornfields, ("corn" is used in the sense of "cereal", not the US meaning of maize)."

Maruba Santoh
-------------

https://fedcoseeds.com/seeds/maruba-santoh-asian-green-3209[`https://fedcoseeds.com/seeds/maruba-santoh-asian-green-3209`]

"(35 days) Brassica rapa (pekinensis group) Open pollinated. With Maruba you get four vegetables in one. The loose round vibrant chartreuse leaves provide a mild piquant mustardy flavor while the flat white stems impart a juicy crisp pac choy taste. High-end chefs like to use the blossoms. Market grower Scott Howell finds the flavor more subtle and complex than that of other greens and cuts Maruba small for his mesclun. Fairly bolt tolerant, so plant after the early spring flea beetle invasion subsides."

"Maruba Santoh will germinate at temperatures between 50-85F. Seedlings emerge in just 3 days in summer. For summer use, direct sow, thin the rows for baby salad mix, then let the “heads” (it doesn’t actually head up) develop to full size (6-10″ tall) after about 35-40 days. Or transplant two week old starts. We tend to grow our plants quite big (12″ tall) and harvest by the leaf, several times over. Maruba Santoh makes a fine substitute for lettuce, and a tasty quick-cooking green."

Tatsoi/Tah Tsai (Brassica rapa)
-------------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsoi[`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsoi`]

"Tatsoi (Brassica rapa subsp. narinosa or Brassica rapa var. rosularis) is an Asian variety of Brassica rapa grown for greens.
Also called tat choy, it is closely related to the more familiar Bok Choy.
This plant has become popular in North American cuisine as well, and is now grown throughout the world.
It is also called 'Chinese flat cabbage', 'rosette pakchoi' or 'broadbeaked mustard', 'spoon mustard', or 'spinach mustard'. 

It can be grown to harvestable size in 45–50 days, and can withstand temperatures down to –10 °C (15 °F).
Tatsoi can even be harvested from under snow. 
It takes 5 to 15 days to emerge, and 45 days to mature.
Tatsoi contains high levels of vitamin C, carotenoids, folic acid, calcium and potassium.

Tatsoi is used for pesto, salads, stir frys and garnishing soup. According to Food52, "Tatsoi is a very versatile green,
equally suited to being served raw or lightly cooked. To make it easy, just use tatsoi anywhere you’d use spinach.
Lightly steam or sauté it, wilt the leaves with a warm dressing, or add them to a soup at the end of cooking."
The leaves are similar to romaine, while the stalks taste a little like cucumber, with a mild bitterness.
Leaves and inner stalk are tender; outer stalk is typically discarded.
Typical cooking is to stir fry the leaves and the stalks. They also can be pickled."

Tokyo Bekana
------------

https://www.sustainablemarketfarming.com/2017/06/20/asian-greens-for-june-tokyo-bekana/[`https://www.sustainablemarketfarming.com/2017/06/20/asian-greens-for-june-tokyo-bekana/`]

"Lettuce is hard to grow in summer in our Virginia climate. Tokyo bekana (Brassica rapa chinensis) can be used as an alternative. It won’t get bitter in hot weather. Because it is fast-growing, you can sow it when you realize a lettuce shortage is looming – it grows faster than lettuce, and bigger than most lettuce varieties, so you can make up for lost time.

Or, once you’ve tried it, you might decide to plan for Tokyo bekana in the summer rather than lettuce. The flavor is very mild, and most people don’t notice they aren’t eating lettuce. The texture of the white stems is very crunchy and juicy, and the frilly leaves are sweet and tender.The color of the leaves is chartreuse: a light bright lime green.

We sow 4/30 – 6/15 and transplant at 2 weeks old. Germination at temperatures of 50-85°F is quick and reliable. Growth is fast. It can be harvested at any stage from microgreens to full-size “heads” – it never actually heads up, as a Napa Chinese cabbage does, but forms a loose head of big frilly leaves about 45 days after sowing.

Harvest Tokyo bekana at any stage: Young baby leaves for salad mix after 25 days, or the whole plant when fully mature at 
10-12″ tall (45 days). You can harvest individual leaves and keep coming back for more. Juvenile plants can be cut and bunched for market. Once you have lots you can cut the whole plant. Full size plants weigh up to 1.25 lbs. each.

It is an open pollinated heirloom variety so the seeds can be saved and replanted.

It can be grown in the fall and spring outdoors, and in the winter hoophouse in our climate. It has good frost tolerance, down to around 25°F (-4°C), perhaps even 15ºF (-9ºC) with thick rowcover."

Yokatta-Na
----------

https://www.fedcoseeds.com/seeds/yokatta-na-asian-green-3223[`https://www.fedcoseeds.com/seeds/yokatta-na-asian-green-3223`]

"(21 days baby; 45 days mature) Brassica rapa (narinosa group) F-1 hybrid. “What a surprise! The heads grow well larger than a foot tall and we ate the 2nd growth heads whole like young bok choy,” reported the Wolperts in Belington, WV. Quick-growing and versatile, tolerating both heat and cold, Yokatta can extend your season at either end, while simultaneously broadening your culinary range. Use it either raw in salad mixes or cooked in stir-fries. The deep green tender leaves, though flavorful, lack the mustard “bite” found in so many Asian greens and can be harvested as a cut-and-come-again crop or at maturity."

Yukina Savoy
------------

https://www.sustainablemarketfarming.com/2017/10/17/asian-greens-in-october-yukina-savoy-tatsoi/[`https://www.sustainablemarketfarming.com/2017/10/17/asian-greens-in-october-yukina-savoy-tatsoi/`]

"Yukina Savoy is a very  delicious cold tolerant cooking green. It grows in a rosette, like  tatsoi, but bigger, less shiny, more blistered. It survives down to 10°F (-12°C) outdoors, so is a good outdoor crop in late fall. Ours is doing so well this year that we started eating outer leaves in early October, planning to eat more later. We eat from the outdoor crop from mid-October until  mid-December. Outdoors, we transplant them 12″ (30 cm) apart.

We have also transplanted some in our hoophouse (sown 9/15) to feed us in December and January. A second sowing (9/24) will feed us in January and February. It is fast-growing in the fall, taking 21 days to reach baby size, 45 days to full size. The plants grow quite large, we transplant them at 10.5″ (26 cm) apart. They grow 12″ (30 cm) tall.

In the spring (which comes early indoors) Yukina Savoy has the advantage of being somewhat heat-tolerant – it doesn’t bolt until the middle of March in there. Of course, we aim to have eaten it all before they get a chance to bolt.

For commercial sales, the whole plants are cut, gathered and fastened with a tie. For home use, you have the option of simply taking the leaves you want for immediate use, and letting the heart of the plant continue to make more growth."
