*LineageOS for Essential PH-1* - https://wiki.oddsolutions.us/devices/mata/[`https://wiki.oddsolutions.us/devices/mata/`]

=====
LineageOS is an operating system for smartphones, tablet computers, and set-top boxes, based on Android with mostly free and open-source software. 

LineageOS includes many essential and useful apps, but t is free from unnecessary software often pre-installed by a phone's manufacturer or carrier that is considered to be bloatware.

LineageOS offers several features that Android Open Source Project (AOSP) does not include. 
=====

=== LineageOS for microG

https://lineage.microg.org/[`https://lineage.microg.org/`]

=====
As a response to the refusal for several reasons of support for signature spoofing in official builds, a LineageOS fork with microG services included, known as "LineageOS for microG", was created. The project ships custom builds of LineageOS with the required patch and native F-Droid support, bundled with the MicroG project's free re-implementation of proprietary Gapps. In other respects it follows upstream, shipping OTA updates every seven days.

=====
Like Apple’s iOS and iPadOS, Google provides means to automatically back up your Android device to the cloud. This setting is typically toggled on, but you can verify by following these steps in stock Android 11 and Samsung phones:

*Step 1*: Swipe down from the top to expand the notification shade and tap the cog icon. This opens the Settings panel.

*Step 2*: Tap Google or System (stock Android only).

*Step 3*: Tap Backup.

*Step 4*: Tap the toggle next to Back Up to Google Drive if this feature isn’t enabled already.
