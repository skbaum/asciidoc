A Manual of Historical Literature (1888, 720)

*****
"What histories shall I read with most profit? What historical books shall I put into the hands of my son and my daughter? What course and what methods will be most advantageous to our historical club? What histories shall we buy for our town and college libraries? What shall I buy for my own library?

These arc questions that, in one form or another, I have often heard asked; but I have sought in vain for a volume that would answer them. Of books about books there is certainly no scarcity; but in all the twenty thousand volumes which a distinguished librarian recently declared to be necessary for the proper bibliographical outfit for a great public library, I do not know of one that can be put into the hands of a student of general history with any justifiable confidence that it will guide him aright in the prosecution of his researches. But for the want of such a volume, I should not have ventured to undertake what may seem to many like trying to add to the infinite.

The need which seemed to justify the undertaking has given form to the work produced. It has been my constant desire and aim to provide a book such as would have been of most service to me when, as a university student, I was reaching out in various directions for help in carrying on my historical studies. What I then wanted was guidance in the selection of books; and such guidance involved not simply critical reviews, but also careful descriptions and characterizations; not only information whether a given book approached an ideal standard of excellence, but also whether it was the best authority accessible on the subject
which I wished to know something about; not only, in fine, to what additions and subtractions I ought to subject a certain writer's works, in case I should read them, but also whether, in the bewildering number of attractive volumes about me, it was worth my while to read that particular writer's works at all. I cannot doubt, that the lack of some such suitable guidance is responsible for an enormous waste of good intentions.

The want to which I refer is not, in my opinion, to be supplied by the issue of dogmatic rules and directions. I have not much faith in so-called "courses of reading," for the reason that the very habit of independent inquiry and research necessary for successful scholarship rebels against the oppression of any prescribed order of study. The best, therefore, that can be done for the reader is simply to give him such information as will be most likely to lead him to the knowledge he is in search of.

Acting upon these beliefs, I have endeavored, in the preparation of this work, to accomplish two more or less distinct purposes. In the first place, it has been my aim to furnish, as best I could, such information about the most desirable books as the historical reader and student is likely to profit by; and, in the second, to suggest the proper methods and order of using the materials so indicated. Accordingly, each of the chapters, except the Introduction, consists of two parts; the first being devoted to descriptions of books, and the second to suggestions to students and readers as to the best order and method of using them. These suggestions are to be regarded as hints rather than as specific directions, and it is hoped that they will not be without value to those for whom they are designed. To prevent the necessity on the part of the student of frequently turning to other portions of the volume, I have thought it wise, even at the expense of some repetition, to bring together into brief and convenient space in the "Suggestions" expressions of opinion sometimes more elaborately given in other portions of the work.

For reasons too obvious to need explanation, the portions devoted to the historical literature of England and of the United States have been made more comprehensive in scope than any others. In the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters, under the head of "Suggestions to Students and Readers,'' I have given a much more extendod account of sources of information than was elsewhere deemed desirable. I havo also embodied in each of these chapters a number of pages designed especially to assist such students as are making a thorough study of the constitutional history of England and of the United States. It is hoped that these suggestions and the numerous references they contain will prove not the least helpful portion of the volume.

Perhaps it is hardly necessary to say that it has not been my purpose to give an exhaustive bibliography of the historical literature of any of the nations concerning which I have written. To accomplish such a task would have been impossible, even if it had been desirable. The effort has been simply to select from the almost overwhelming abundance of materials a considerable number of the most desirable books, and to describe them in such a way as to enable the student and reader to judge of their peculiarities and of their desirableness, as well as of their general merits.

In the process of selection, two considerations have been predominant. The first has been the question of merit, the other the question of accessibility. In a few instances, books not easy to be procured have been described solely on account of their great importance. These form a small class, of which Arthur Young's "Travels in France" may serve as a good example. Occasionally, also, a work like Rollin's "Ancient History" has been briefly described only to be condemned, for no other reason than because it is to be found in every book-stall, and is likely to be thrust before the buyer at every book sale. But these are to be regarded as exceptional cases. In general, the most important historical works are easily accessible; and, therefore, it has not often been found necessary to select for description a work that is difficult to procure, or one that is without some characteristics of marked excellence.

In dealing with books in French and German, I have sometimes
given the title in the original and sometimes in English. If I had been writing exclusively, or even mainly, for those who know French and German, I should, of course, in all cases have given the titles in the original language. But it seemed to me that the interests of good scholarship would be subserved by striving to render assistance to the largest practicable number of persons, rather than by limiting the usefulness of any considerable portion of the work to those who are familiar with the languages of France and Germany. In all cases, therefore, where a good translation has been made, the title has been given in English. Where the translation is not conspicuous, either for its merits or its defects, the question has been determined by the consideration of accessibility. In such cases the language of the version most easy to be procured has been adopted. In case a translation is notably poor, the title has been given in the original language, but the fact of the existence of a translation has been indicated.

In determining the order in which books on a given subject, or in a given group, should be placed in the volume, I have also thought it wise not to be governed by a strict uniformity of method. Under the head of "General Histories" the alphabetical order seemed the most natural and desirable. But in those portions of the work which are devoted to "Histories of Limited Periods" the chronological order appeared to be most conducive to the convenience of the student. Some of the books described it has been found impossible to subject to a strict classification; and, therefore, in some instances a title may be found where in advance it would not be looked for. With the help of the index, however, the student will have no difficulty in finding whatever the volume contains.

Many of the works described have been published in two or more editions. The principle of selection has been precisely that which would guide me in giving private advice to a student seeking information. Even at the risk of giving offence, I have not hesitated to condemn a reprint of an early edition when a revised and improved edition is accessible. The aim, in all cases, has been to indicate the best; and, in general, where there are two or more editions, each having peculiar characteristics of excellence, the fact has been noted, and the peculiarities of each have been pointed out.

It will be found that there is considerable variety in the length and minuteness of the descriptions. If this variety should seem to any one to be too marked, I have only to say, in explanation, that while the question involved is one on which probably no two persons would agree, it is certain that every one would deem it very unwise to give to all the books worthy of mention the same space that might properly be given to those of Gibbon and Macaulay or to those of Buckle and Bancroft. In general, it has seemed to me that the fulness of the descriptions should be determined by the twofold consideration of the inherent merits of the work under review, and of the extent to which the historical student is likely to use it in the course of his investigations. Yon Hammer - Purgstall's great work on Turkey is even more important, in its way, than Hildreth's " History of the United States;" but there are obvious reasons why, in a work of this kind, it should occupy less space.

I do not dare to hope that I have committed no errors in the perplexing task of determining what authors and books to admit to these pages and what to exclude from them. The difficulties of decision have often been very great; and I am fully aware that in a volume of this kind, not intended to be all-comprehensive in its scope, I am providing certain disappointment for a very considerable number of readers. For all such I have no better word in the way of answer than that of Quintilian which I have placed on the title-page. If I did not hope that the book would be judged for what it contains rather than for what it omits, I should have no courage to give it to the public."

"Reading is that art by which I am enabled to avail myself of the recorded wisdom of mankind. But here a practical difficulty suggests itself. The multiplicity of books, even in my own language, renders i careful selection absolutely indispensable. It has been computed that of the 650,000 (?) volumes in the English language, about 50,000 would repay a perusal.  Suppose a person to read 100 pages a day, or 100 volumes a year, it would require 500 years to exhaust such a library! How important is it, then, to know what to read! And how shall this knowledge be obtained?  Now let us revert to our opening remarks upon the value of a dictionary of words. If there be such an advantage in full definition, in alphabetical arrangement, and consequent facility of reference, why should we not have a dictionary of books and authors at well as of words?

"A Catalogue of Crime has been my companion in reading mystery and crime literature for over 20 years and it has been an indispensable guide to reading the best of such works. As anyone who reads mystery and crime fiction knows, for every Sayers or Christie, there are 20 or 30 others whose works are formulaic, unimaginative and a waste of your time. Barzun and Taylor's book has been the means to separate out the worthwhile from the incredible amount of dross out there.

It is important to understand that A Catalogue of Crime is no more readable as a book than a dictionary or an encyclopedia. It is a reference source. It is especially handy to have with you in a used book store. The book has helpful lists of especially good mysteries and worthwhile authors can also be found by browsing through the entries.

The major shortcoming of the book is that it hasn't been updated in decades. In the meantime, the output of mysteries and crime fiction has been, if anything, more prolific than ever. Unfortunately, most of the output seems to be poor, which was probably true of most of the output of the 'golden age' as well.

If you're a fan of well-crafted, well-written mysteries, A Catalogue of Crime is a must." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD0O5D8TC94XW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060157968[James A. Gorton]

*****
Another outstanding guide to genre fiction from someone who has authored many (e.g., The Annotated Index to the Thrill Book), this work focuses on separately published English-language reference sources documenting and describing the primary and secondary literatures of mystery and detective fiction, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, companions, bibliographies, indexes, directories, handbooks, and a few, highly selective web sites and electronic databases. While detective and mystery fiction may range widely, including everything from science to religious fiction, Bleiler chooses to limit the scope to the commonly understood genre, excluding works devoted to classical thrillers, adventure and espionage stories, gangster tales, historical novels, Westerns, and true-crime stories. The book is arranged in chapters by reference type and then alphabetically by reference, with each entry containing standard bibliographic information: author or editor, title, place and year of publication, publisher, pagination, series title, index, edition or revision notes, and ISBN and LC numbers. Annotations furnish descriptions of intent, organization, and content along with perceptively critical evaluations varying in length from a single short paragraph to one page. A worthwhile addition to the literature; recommended for public and academic libraries. - http://www.amazon.com/Reference-Research-Mystery-Detective-Humanities/dp/1563089246/[A. Marilyn Rosenthal]

"The pseudo-science of Alchemy, with ts attractive goals, its mystical associations, unprincipled charlatanism, and its honest self-deception, forms a fascinating chapter in the history of intellectual aberrations. Regarded as a phase of chemical science, to which it made prodigious contributions, students of chemical history find it an attractive field of research, and not a few chemical bibliophiles treasure the extraordinary literature born of a search for the Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life. This literature, once so voluminous (a trade catalogue of 1868 contains 2500 numbers), is rapidly becoming scarcer, especially in the more desirable works.

The volumes exhibited have been selected by their owner from his private collection, numbering about two hundred and fifty volumes on Alchemy and seven hundred volumes on Chemistry (not comprising periodicals). To Grolierites they will look rather unattractive in the original and inferior bindings, but many are curiously illustrated, and some are interesting for their very poverty. The Catalogue has been very carefully prepared with technical accuracy, but economic reasons compelled short titles. Bibliographical and explanatory notes have been appended to the titles, in hopes of making the list more serviceable to non-professional readers. The editor alone is responsible for the data and the comments."

"In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit that I am a big fan of book lists. I have used the Modern Library fiction and non-fiction lists to find referrals and lists by Pringle and Moorcock to locate works of fantasy. The CWA British and US lists have suggested a number of mystery gems I would not likely have found on my own. For science fiction ideas, I have utilized a list of the 100 best novels from 1949 to 1984 by David Pringle.

Broderick and Di Filippo have updated Pringle's work by compiling a new list of SF novels from 1985 through 2010. A foreward by David Pringle provides continuity with the earlier list.

The new collection resembles the earlier one in that it is chronological rather than providing a countdown to the best novel of the period. It covers a shorter time by ten years and includes a much larger selection of female writers than the earlier book given the work produced in the period from which selections were made. I find this new list to be better written and to have more value than the prior one. Broderick and Di Filippo spend far less space than did Pringle on plot summary and provide more context regarding the subject matter in each book. For example, the plot of Handmaid's Tale is compared to 1984 as well as to the way power relationships in society actually developed. There is also more discussion of how some volumes came to be written. The authors explain that Orson Scott Card expanded Ender's Game from a short story by changing the narrative viewpoint to that of an adult telling his story in retrospect. The authors also take the time to think through where each work and author rests in SF history. Ender's Game is compared to Starship Troopers, A Case of Conscience and The Female Man while China Meiville is expansively mentioned in the same breath as Mervyn Peake.

The authors demonstrate their considerable genre knowledge by recounting the literary history of certain tropes in the works represented. In discussing Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, they talk about the development of stories dealing with black market body parts from Niven's Known Space in the sixties to current works. Broderick and Di Filippo also show some courage in evaluating the overall output of some of the authors contained in their list as when they suggest that Card would be regarded as "a minor, respectable, forgotten craftsman" if not for the Ender series.

The true value of the list, of course, is not in the reading pleasure it delivers but in leading the discerning user to new books and authors. Even though I thought I had consumed modestly in the SF field in recent years, I still found 87 books I had not read, many of which I had not come across in any other forum. There are actually far more than 101 books considered as the authors list all 3 of Meiville's Bas-lag books when discussing Perdido Street Station and 4 of Gene Wolfe's series in the entry for Nightside the Long Sun.

In using lists as sources for reading referral, not only have I located hidden classics but I have found that virtually all recommended books reach at least an acceptable level of literary merit. In a genre such as SF, where there is a very large range of quality exhibited in what is published, lists like those of Pringle and Broderick/Di Filippo can improve and enrich the reading selection process." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B09WJE54B5TQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933065397[The Ginger Man]

"Examining the work of more than one hundred writers, in a wide variety of genres including detective, spy, gothic, fantasy, comic, and science fiction, this book is an unusually comprehensive introduction to the novels and short stories of the period. Providing fresh readings of famous modernist figures (Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Joyce, Woolf, Forster, Lawrence, and others), Robert L. Caserio also brings new attention to lesser-known writers who merit increased attention. He provides readers with an overview of modernist fiction's intellectual milieu, and addresses its contextualization by history and politics - feminism, global war, and the emergence of the welfare state after World War II. An ideal introduction for the student, this book offers a thought-provoking re-examination of literary history, and an exploration of the unique value of fiction's portrayals of the world." - https://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Introduction-1900-1950-Introductions-Literature/dp/1107029287/[Amazon]

"During my whole life, now rapidly approaching fourscore, I have been a diligent reader, and, as far as my means would allow, a greedy purchaser of all works connected with early English literature. It is nearly sixty years since I became possessor of my first really valuable old book of this kind, — Wilson's "Art of Logic," printed by Richard Grafton in 1551, — from which I ascertained the not unimportant facts that "Ralph Roister Doister" was an older play than "Gammer Gurton's Needle," and that it had been written by Nicholas Udall, Master of Eton School. I thus learned who was the author of the earliest comedy, properly so called, in our language. This was my first literary discovery, made several years anterior, although I had not occasion to render it public, until I printed my Notes upon " Dodsley's Old Plays" •oon after 1820. My latest discovery, which occurred only a few months ago, is that "Tottel's Miscellany," 1557, the oldest and most interesting in our language, containing as it does the poems of the Earl of Surrey, Sir Thomas Wyat, and their contemporaries, has always, during the last three centuries, been reprinted, by Dr. Sewell, Bishop Percy, Dr. Nott, and their followers, from the second instead of the first edition. The differences between the two are not merely extremely curious, but very interesting and important.

Between the one discovery and the other there was an interval of perhaps fifty years; and whatever may appear to be new in the ensuing volumes has been the result of literary investigation during considerably more than that period. My early employments were irksome and wearisome; but, stimulated in some degree by my first success, and by my love for the best poetry the world has produced, I lightened my labors by the collection and perusal of old English books, and by making extracts from and criticisms upon them, whether in prose or verse; so that in time they formed a large body of manuscripts, consisting of separate articles alphabetically arranged.

The work in the hands of the reader has been mainly derived from this source, and not a few of the notices are of forty, or even fifty, years standing. Although I kept constantly adding to, altering and correcting them, both as to facts and opinions, some of them are, in the most material points, just as they came from my pen, soon after the perusal of the books to which they relate. It will be found that a few are reviews of productions altogether unknown to bibliographers, while others apply to publications of which only a single copy remains to us, or to separate tracts of the utmost rarity.

It is true that notices of a very few more common, but still scarce, books will be found interspersed, a circumstance arising from the fact that I have incorporated all the productions formerly embraced in what is generally known as the "Bridgewater Catalogue," which about thirty years ago I prepared for the first Earl of Ellesmere, and which was privately printed at the expense of that gifted, enlightened, and liberal nobleman. Through my hands in 1837 he dispersed, as presents, in different quarters of the globe, the fifty copies of which the whole impression consisted; but, some years after the completion of the undertaking, his Lordship expressed his regret, that the limitation in point of number much restricted the utility of that Catalogue. He therefore authorized me at any time to reprint it, if I thought it would answer as a pecuniary speculation. During Lord Ellesmere's life I never availed myself of this permission; but a proposal of the kind was made to me not long after his demise. I did not then listen to it, because I was still anxious to introduce corrections upon many of the pages; and because, even then, I contemplated a work upon a broader basis, and of a wider range, not limited to the contents of any single library, whether public or private.

...

Readers may imagine that I have obtained much in formation from such works as Centura Literaria, " The British Bibliographer," or Restituta, to say nothing of smaller productions of a similar character. This is a mistake. I have never referred to them without acknowledgment; but it will be found in the fourteen hundred pages that follow this preface that, excepting for the sake of illustration or for the correction of some important error, I have never criticised, or I may almost say, quoted a single volume noticed by others. It was generally enough to induce me to lay an old book aside to find that it had already passed through the hands of Brydges, Park, or Haslewood. To the taste and learning of the first I bear willing testimony. The second possessed knowledge, but without much discrimination; and the third was a man remarkable for his diligence, but remarkable also for the narrowness of his views, for his total want of judgment, and for the paucity of his information.

I can assert, without the chance of contradiction, that there is no one book, the merits or peculiarities of which are discussed in these volumes, that has not passed through my own hands and been carefully read by my own eyes. There is no extract, no line, that has not been copied by my own pen; and although I cannot for an instant suppose that I have altogether avoided mistakes, I hope that I have made as few as possible. In a case of this sort, where hundreds of names occur, and thousands of dates are given, errors must inevitably have crept in; but I am aware of none, whether relating to books or their authors, that I have not set right in the "Additions, Notes and Corrections," placed at the beginning of my book, as it were, to solicit the indulgence of the reader in the outset.1 Even if this work be found to deserve reprinting, I can hardly hope to live to superintend a revised edition of it.

It may be necessary to add, that I have purposely avoided old English dramas and plays, because they form so distinct a subject that they ought to be separately treated. I have by me many details regarding the plots, characters, poetry and appliances of performances of this description, from the remotest dates, some of them relating to productions hitherto unrecorded; and if time, opportunity and eyesight should unexpectedly and graciously be allowed me, it will much add to my happiness to be able hereafter to put them into shape for publication. Bum spiro spero."

Cotsworth was well respected and successful in statistics and accountancy but, according to George Eastman, he was broke in New York by 1924 having spent everything and sold his collection of pictures to finance his International Fixed Calendar League and Eastman stepped in, backed him for a number of years, and applied his calendar within Kodak. In the mid to late twenties it seemed possible - the League of Nations had taken on his calendar and the US government was taking it seriously. Most of this almanac is devoted to investigating and explaining ancient measures of time. I've come across many citations of the importance and lasting worth of Cotsworth's work here but most of them come from doubtful sources; they may be true, or not. A note by Cotsworth explains that this book was printed over a number of years; some of the pyramid stuff before his 1900 trip to Egypt which 'led to those remarkable extensions which proved to be so highly desirable, although they deferred the issue of the book and considerably increased the cost.' - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35924343-the-rational-almanac[Goodreads]

Cumulated Index

*A Cumulated Index to the Books of 1898-99* (1900, 607)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://books.google.com/books?id=P4sSAAAAIAAJ[+https://books.google.com/books?id=P4sSAAAAIAAJ+]

*****
"The first number of the Cumulative Book Index, published two years ago, was an unprofessional looking pamphlet ot sixteen pages and had in it no promise that in two years it would grow into the volume which now appears as the Index to Books oflti9X-1899.

The Index was not devised to make money nor win lame, but was an invention mothered by necessity. The search through dozens of publishers' bulletins and pamphlets, no two ot which, even by a kindly chance, were alike in shape, size, or arrangement, if indeed there were any arrangement at all,—such a search was paying too dear for our information. It was a necessity that this information should be collected in one place and arranged for use. No one seemed disposed to undertake the work ; even the six-months' list which supplemented the Annual American Catalogue, the only one which approached the cumulative plan, had been discontinued, and there was no choice but to provide for ourselves.

The name "index" was adopted as best defining the scope of the new publication. It was an author list, with brief title, price, and publisher, and references from titles and subjects to author entries. The name, though still retained, has been outgrown and does not adequately characterize the present volume. The word "Cumulative" expressed the publisher's intention to reprint the bibliography from time to time, incorporating in it a record of the new books as they appeared, so that the list might be complete to date of issue. How often the bibliography should lie reprinted was left to the future to determine. By many ot our patrons, the cumulative plan was not understood. They had been waiting so long for such a finding list, that when it was in their hands they did not recognize it. While one appreciative friend, Mr. VV. W. Waters, of Pittsburg, the first to send us a good word, said that the Index was "too good to be true," others insisted that it was not true, and for over a year we received constant demands for back numbers, in spite of the assurance that back numbers were nseless, their contents having been reprinted in the latest number.

...

After the publication of the December number, which was a complete catalogueof thebooks of 1898, our circle of friends increased and we were encouraged to make further improvements. A careful system was instituted under which few errors are likely to occur, or if made, can be promptly corrected. Before the publication of the Index of May 1898, which was a cumulation of sixteen months, the whole bibliography was thoroughly revised and in large part rewritten, in order that the entry of each book might contain the full name of the author, the exact title as found on the title page, and other useful data before omitted. Since the publication of the May number our bibliography, owing to careful methods, has grown rapidly and now numbers in the present volume about 17,000 books, or about 40,000 entries. Each entry has been compared with every available source of information, changes in prices and publishers have been recorded, and tables of contents have been added to the entries of those books not adequately described by title. This comparison has enabled us to discover mistakes in publishers' catalogues, and other book lists, and has won us the thanks of the Librarian of Congress for calling attention to a confusion of two authors of similar names and other errors in the copyright list."

*The Story of Classic Crime in 100 Books* (2017, 370)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
"The crime stories written during the Golden Age of crime have proven their ability to remain entertaining and even addictive among modern readers of crime fiction. These books are different in many ways from the modern novels but if you look closely you will recognize an aspect in the modern book which mirrors a theme or technique which was once considered brand new. Martin Edwards has once again given me a method for studying the classic crime novel and the authors who paved the way for all the changes which have taken place within the genre. This book confines itself to the first half of the last century, between 1901 and 1950, and is a companion to the series of the British Library's series of crime classics. If you've enjoyed reading any of those reprints, this work will go far toward filling out your knowledge of the authors, titles, and themes which moved the classic crime fiction stories forward as they continued to change and evolve.

There is simply too much information in this book to give anything like a list of authors or even a list of book titles. I can tell you that there are twenty-four chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of the novels from miraculous murders (also called impossible murders) to the lure of the countryside, the English manor house, the amateur detective, the educated sleuth, the backlash against politicians and on and on. In each chapter Edwards explains the theme, gives a brief synopsis of the examples of the novels he has chosen to illustrate the theme and a brief biography of the author. Each chapter discusses four or five novels. The book as a whole moves in a more or less chronological order, at least in the easiest way for the format to do that.

The book also contains an Introduction, Select Bibliography, Index of Titles, and an Index of Authors which all provide a tremendous amount of detail on the subject. This is a book to savor, a book to keep as a reference guide, a book to help you find authors you aren't familiar with but want to try to track down. Even the most well known authors may have a novel mentioned in this collection which you have missed. I was equally surprised at how many of the authors and stories I was familiar with as well as how many authors I knew nothing about. Even though I initially read this book in digital format I already know I will have to get the print edition so it can go on my shelf of Classic Age crime fiction reference books. How could I resist?" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H2G4BX4JYZOA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464207232[J. Lesley]

*Bibliographical Notes on Histories of Inventions and Books of Secrets* (1896)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://books.google.com/books?id=POEIAAAAIAAJ[+https://books.google.com/books?id=POEIAAAAIAAJ+]

*****
"The following notes may serve to some extent as an introduction to a subject wide in itself, and with numerous and important connections. The history of practical invention and of technical progress is one which might well engage the attention of students of anthropology and antiquities, as it throws light on many points connected with the growth of social life and civilization. The desire and the power to turn external objects to his service and convenience are developed to such an extent in man, that, among the many differences between him and other animals, may be reckoned the various arts by which he induces nature to accommodate herself to his wants; among the lower animals one looks in vain for anything parallel to the arts of cookery, medicine, metallurgy—to the systematic use of tools, of clothing, of weapons.

In ancient times the various handicrafts were monopolies of certain families or castes; in the middle ages the handicraftsmen were too glad to pursue their callings in obscurity; it is only in the most recent years that arts and manufactures have acquired such paramount interest, that the special or technical education of those who are to exercise them has come to be thought of national importance. While, in the days of the Greeks and Romans, the artizan was a despicable if not an almost infamous person, and, in the middle ages, was oppressed by the military and ruling classes, against whom, nevertheless, he carried on a ceaseless struggle until he succeeded in asserting his importance, and even his equality with them, it has been reserved for the present day for ignorance of arts and manufactures, and indifference to their progress, to be as discreditable as they were formerly dignified. The history of the growth of the arts themselves, and of the attitude of society towards them, is, therefore, of wider extent, and of greater philosophical interest than at first sight appears. This history has not as yet been written and, as time goes on and material gathers, the more difficult it becomes. The only work in which the attempt has been made is the "History of Inventions" of Beckmann, written towards the end of last century.* This work, however, is less a history in the strict sense of the term, than a collection of antiquarian essays upon various objects of manufacture, and upon some technical questions. The essays, besides, are not arranged in any definite order, and have no direct connection with each other, but they are very elaborate, and show a wonderful amount of research and knowledge. Since Beckmann's time, I do not remember any laborious German who has followed up his work. There is certainly nothing on the subject in English.

It is not my intention now to say anything about the progress of arts and manufactures at all, but only to bring under your notice a section of literature which is nearly ignored by bibliographers and antiquaries, and is altogether out of the ken of book-reprinting clubs.

It is hardly to be expected that a practical art can have any literature worth speaking of. The man who is busy practising it can have little time to write about it, and he who wishes to learn it must put to his hand and work at it, and that under the supervision of a master, and not by merely reading books. This is the apprenticeship that every one must serve. No amount of reading will make a sculptor, or a gardener, or a shoemaker, or a surgeon, or a musical executant. The arts must be acquired by practice, and they are extended and improved by practice. Every one who exercises them comes to have special power and certain ways of doing things, which may enable him to surpass others who are similarly engaged. These are his "secrets," which very often he cannot, or will not, reveal to others. Rapid insight into a particular case, power of overcoming physical obstacles, ingenious adaptations of means to ends, exhibition of due care at the right time, enable one man to effect what others cannot.

In earlier times artists were very chary indeed of telling their secrets, and in the great craze of the middle ages—the craze to make the philosopher's stone—the adepts were continually on their guard to conceal their art from the unworthy, while revealing what was thought suitable for the
genuine artist to know. The philosopher was warned to admit no one to his laboratory—or to his confidence. Even at the present day, secrets have not wholly died out; there are manufactures which are still undivulged, and any one engaged in the scientific investigation of some phenomenon or law of nature, will not tell his professional brethren unreservedly what he expects to discover, before he has finished his labours.

It would seem, however, that in spite of the precautions of the older artists, their private ways of working, of producing substances, of making colours, and effecting all kinds of material changes, oozed out and became at last public property. But even after their publication, these methods and receipts retained, paradoxically, the name of "Secrets,"* and many collections of them appeared during the last three or four hundred years. It is beyond my power to give a complete list of these; my purpose at present, as I have already said, is to exhibit a few of those to which my attention happens to have been recently directed, and of which some at least are possessed of a certain amount of archaeological and bibliographic interest.

This set of books divides into several groups, but perfect classification of them is impossible on account of the way the themes interweave.

I) There are collections of secrets of nature, or treatises on natural history, general science, and cosmogony. Of this set, Pliny's history seems to have been the model.

II) There are treatises on what was called natural magic (as distinguished from black magic or necromancy)—that is, the production of secret effects in optics, acoustics, magnetism, &c., &c., by natural causes. This is the form which natural philosophy originally took.

III) There are treatises which deal chiefly with chemical, pharmaceutical, and medical secrets.

IV) There are treatises on life and generation: physiological secrets.

V) There are treatises on technical or art secrets, strictly so called, and they may be arranged conveniently in two classes: general collections containing receipts relating to a variety of arts, and special collections containing receipts of use in one art or handicraft only.

I have examples of each of these classes to exhibit."

*****
"First, know that this book was published in 1941, and except for a 10-year anniversary update at the end that adds a few more books recommended by Haycraft and by Ellery Queen, that is where it ends. If, however, you're interested in being pointed to the most worthwhile early stories of detection, you'll find much rewarding here. The author is a bit annoying in trying to narrowly define the detective story, however. Nowadays, when genres and sub-genres tend to be blended together for good or ill, this sort of distinction seems unnecessary. It reminds me of the used book store I visited where mystery was in one section and crime in another. (And thrillers in yet another.) Haycraft tells the usual story of the origin of the detective story with Edgar Allan Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and proceeds through early writers such as Anna Katherine Green to the successes of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes up to the "present day" of 1941 or so. This means that the first part of the careers of some well known writers such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, John Dickson Carr, and Michael Innes are included. Also, unfortunately, the entire career of Dashiell Hammett, who even at that early date had already stopped writing. The main part of the book mentions Raymond Chandler only very briefly, but the 10-years-after update does give him credit and add some of his works to the recommended list. Haycraft, to his credit, doesn't disparage the hard-boiled genre, and is lavish in his praise of Hammett.

More interesting, perhaps, are the writers that have been largely forgotten that Haycraft extolls, such as Mabel Sealey, who is pretty forgotten today. His concise descriptions of his subjects' works, without any plot spoilers to speak of, will whet your appetite to try out some of these books, many of which are now in the public domain. Given his chosen framework, Haycraft only really errs when he states decisively that women do not make good fictional detectives. It is a bit jarring to read such a blatantly sexist statement in a book that is otherwise a model of balance. Haycraft, for instance, points out not just the strengths of each writer, but also their weaknesses." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D7TNOSE624EW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0819602167[James Mowry]

"I realized after I brought my pile of books home from the library that I had a personal copy of this reference work, but hadn’t looked at it for twenty-some years. Now that I know I have it, it comes upstairs to be on my reference shelf. It is one of the best crime/mystery/thriller/espionage reference books around. What makes it extra-special is that it covers the world of writers in those genres for primarily the post-war period. Earlier reviews by contributing writers give us an overview of the various sub-genres in a clear and informative way. What I found most helpful was the section: “Writers and Their Books: A Consumer Guide.” If you are ever wondering what to read – what you have maybe missed reading – this guide is for you. Hundreds of authors are discussed (many of whom I had not heard of) along with a list of their best or most popular books. This section was put together by Dorothy B. Hughes, Reginald Hill, Melvyn Barnes, and H. R. F. Keating. This section alone is worth the price of admission. I have several of the standard reference texts on crime novels, but this one is the best. Highly recommended." - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6711611-whodunit-a-guide-to-crime-suspense-and-spy-fiction[Tony]

*****
If the mystery genre has lacked anything over the past century it's serious criticism. Aside from Jon L. Breen's reviews in Ellery Queens Mystery Magazine and Marilyn Stasio's pieces for the Times Book Review, mysteries have been virtually ignored by critics despite their permanent presence on bestseller lists. Bruce Murphy's The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery satisfies this need for insightful, intelligent commentary. Mr. Murphy provides a thorough analysis of mystery fiction from Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin to Bill Pronzini's nameless detective and even includes literary greats who have given the mystery a try-Jorge Louis Borges, William Faulkner, and Chester Himes to name a few. The mystery is also dealt with internationally through explorations of Manuel Vazquez Montalban, Paco Taibo, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Moreover, Mr. Murphy provides etymological histories of terms often encountered in the mystery novel and dispels common misconceptions readers have about the true purposes of agencies like INTERPOL. No subgenre is ignored: cozies, malice-domestics, psychological suspense, police procedurals, and the hard-boiled novel are all given equal attention. Brilliant, but forgotten crime writers like Charles Willeford, often ignored in other encyclopedias and bibliograpies, are finally given the respect they deserve. And cozy novelists Leo Bruce and Patricia Wentworth are rarely examined in the depth that they are here. Bruce Murphy's The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery is for every reader. Besides being comprehensive and informative, the book is just plain fun to read-a must for home libraries and coffee tables. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RL31YMK8EM6NY/[Patrick B. Ambrose]

*****
"The following extract from an article, which I inserted some time ago in a periodicala, may be aptly introduced in this place, as the best justification of the present undertaking. "The literature of the South is rendered universally familiar to us through the study of the southern languages. It is otherwise however with the literature of the North, and especially of Russia, of which even our men of letters, for the most part, know nothing more than what may be gleaned from the common Russian Miscellanies. The chief ground of this ignorance can only be looked for in our very limited acquaintance with the Sclavonic languages; and here the same reproach attaches to the Germans, on other points so studious of knowledge, which is justly brought against the French and Italians in regard to the literature of Germany.

Of all the kingdoms of the North, the Russian Empire, marching on with giant strides towards a state of perfection, rivets most our earnest attention; and yet its language and its literature continue to be almost entirely unknown. Since the beginning of the eigh- ,teenth century, we find intellectual relations existing between Russia and the other European communities; and a strict comparison would
show, that at this period German literature itself occupied no very lofty position. Might not the Italians and French just as well plead this consideration as their excuse, if at the beginning of the nineteenth century they chose to believe that German literature had nothing very great to exhibit? It is asserted that in Russia the higher classes only can make any pretensions to education; but it is forgotten that in every country the great mass of the people resemble each other in this particular, of which every traveller possessing the mere rudiments of any language may convince himself, if, instead of taking the chief towns only as the standard of his conclusions, he will submit to pass some time also with this view in the countryb. Although the Russians as yet can boast no Gothe or Shakspeare—even supposing that these writers could be equalled—yet we already see them, since the middle of last century, in the track which, by the exercise of their extraordinary application and ability, must sooner or later bring them near this point.

To assure himself of this, let any one read
An Attempt at a Short History of Russian Literature, by N. Gretsch, published in the Russian language at St. Petersburg, A. D. 1822, in which are to be found biographical and literary notices of nearly three hundred Russian authors; among whom, in the department of belles lettres alone, some of the chief ornaments of the glorious reign of Alexander the First may be reckoned, as Karamsin, Dmitrijeff, Murawjeff, Oseroff, Schischkoff, Prodobadoff, Lessnizkj, Drossdoff, Protassoff, Kriiloff, Shukofskj, Batjuschkoff, Wasemskj, Schachofskoj, Gnaditsch,Wojejkoff, Puschkin, and many others. This work, written by the Russian imperial councillor of state, Nicolai von Gretsch, a distinguished philologist and grammarian, has been taken as the foundation of the present undertaking; the publication of which is intended to fill up a very perceptible void in our literature. For since the appearance of The Russian Library from 1772 to 1789 {Die Russische Bibliothek, etc.), in eleven volumes, by Bacmeister, a space of now more than forty years, we possess nothing of the same kind in the German language; Strahl's work, called Gelehrtes Russland, or Learned Russia, being devoted exclusively to Russian writers of the ecclesiastical profession, whose numbers have been augmented in my Lexicon of Russian Authors by numerous articles, under the heads of Alexejeff, Amwrossj-Protassoff, Andrej Liisloff, Eugenj Bolchowitinoff °, Busslajeff, Wassilj, Grigorj (Diakon),
Grigorowitsch Wassilj, Michael Dessnizkj, Filaret Drossdoff, Sestrenzewitsch-Bogusch, and others. Besides the Russian authors mentioned by Herr von Gretsch, many others have been added to render the second part of this work more complete; especially those which Alexander Bestuscheff has enumerated in his Review of Russian Literature.

Although on the whole I have adhered to the above-named work of Herr von Gretsch, it appeared to me better suited to my particular plan to divide the History of Literature into two parts; of which the first contains the proper History of Russian Literature, and the second, Biographical and Literary Notices of Russian Authors; and to which last, for the sake of greater convenience, I have given the form of a lexicon. As to the orthography of the Russian names, I have followed the most recent mode, as they are given by Tappe, in compliance with which, for instance, I use ff, «, sh, where others write w or v, y or ui, and sch or the French j\ With regard to the names of places, I have guided myself principally by their ordinary spelling in the most modern geographies."

*****
"It is not given to every one to be a collector of fine books and rare first editions. The prizes are reserved for the millionaire. But the most modest bibliophile, by the pursuit of one special subject, may get together a collection valuable for other reasons. I do not know that I deserve so ambitious a name as bibliophile, but I have no doubt as to the value of the collection of cookery books about which it has been my pleasure and privilege to write. I admit that to the moneyed book-hunter, though he would envy me a few of my volumes, a great number, from his point of view, might seem poor trash. Nor do I claim for my collection completeness. I would not be so foolish with those two thousand five hundred entries in M. Vicaire's Bibliography forever haunting me as a reproach. But then, M. Vicaire does not own the two thousand five hundred books, and I very much doubt whether any one individual ever will. The collector is but mortal. All I claim is that my collection has grown to respectable and, I believe, unrivaled proportions, and 
that the number of books in it, and the countries and centuries they represent lend them as a series the importance which it would be absurd to attribute to each taken separately. 

As for the subject, mine first by chance and now by preference, it needs no apology. Everybody eats and everybody should enjoy eating. The old asceticism that held pleasure in food to be gluttony, and consequently one of the seven deadly sins, has all but disappeared. Every Woman has thrown off the traditional shackles and is no longer ashamed of an honest appetite. It is too late now for the novelist, however romantic, to carry her through the serious crisis of her life, with Eielding's Sophia, on "a little sack-whey made very small and thin.^ The new generation believes with Brillat-Savarin that love of good living is by no means a blemish in woman, though, perhaps, as yet, not every one would go to his lengths and believe that a pretty woman is never prettier than when at table. In one way, something of the old prejudice lingers. It is still considered demoralizing, or, at least, " bad form " to think much about food and drink. But this is a mistake. It was when men and women began to think about eating that they developed it into the Fine Art it ought to be. Sounds might have remained mere noise but for the musician, colors mere discord but for the painter; eating would never have been more than a gross necessity but for the gourmet. "11 faut manger avec esprit," says a French authority, and to do so requires the thought and enthusiasm that the musician or painter gives to his art. Neither does the study of Gastronomy through the ages call for an explanation. "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are" is the fourth in BrillatSavarin's list of Fundamental Truths. It would be more to the purpose to explain why the historian and the philosopher have hitherto paid so little heed to the subject. The world still waits for the Carlyle who will write for it a Philosophy of Food. When he comes he will find in my collection the material made to his hand. 



But if eating were not an art, if food had not its philosophy, my books would still be amusing, and that is their great recommendation. No black-letter man, nor tall copyist, nor uncut man, nor rough-edge man, nor early English dramatist, nor Elzevirian, nor broadsider, nor pasquinader, nor old brown calf man, nor Grangerite, nor tawny moroccoite, nor gilt copper, nor marbled insider, nor editio princeps man, to borrow Dr. Hill Burton's classification, could get as much genuine amusement out of his books as I do out of mine. Now this amusement, for several reasons, either dwindles, or else changes its character so completely, by the end of the eighteenth century that I have brought the story of my books and the bibliography down to no later date. In the nineteenth century there were, on the one hand, the cookery books, prosaic as primers, that, with their business-like, practical, direct methods, were more useful in the kitchen than entertaining in the library; on the other hand, the books about cookery, so literary in flavor that they were not adapted to the kitchen at all. The new writers, of whom Orimod de la Seyniere was the first great master, brought about such a revolution in not only the style, but the very attitude of writers on cookery, that I prefer to consider their work by itself. My study of all these books has made me sufficiently an artist to want to see my own volume as perfectly rounded out. It is my respect for them that shows me the folly of dogmatizing upon the many I do not know at first hand. In the following pages, I do not pretend to rival M. Vicaire or Mr. Hazlitt bibliographicatty. I have not the temerity to wander further afield than my own collection. The illustrations speak for themselves. The old titlepage always has charm, and, in the cookery book, it has besides a character of its own. It served the author the purpose of the modern tradesman's poster or advertisement until, at times, it seems as if his one object had been to sum up upon it the entire contents of his book. The portraits that appear as frontispieces are, to me, an endless source of delight. What new dignity a cookery book acquires when a queen or a man of title presides over it! And with what increased deference one reads the receipts of the chef who evidently takes himself as seriously and solemnly as Robert May or E. Kidder! I wish I could give all the portraits. But it would be unfair to my collection if I did not also show some of the amazing allegories which occasionally replaced the portrait as frontispiece, and of which the plates from Les Dons de Comus and Dr. Lister's edition of Apicius Coelius are typical examples. There are, moreover, the illustrations in the text. I should like nothing better than to include the complete series of plates from Scappi's book, for nowhere else that I know of is there so interesting and full
an inventory of the kitchen as it was in sixteenth century Italy. The models for the carver, whether of fish, fowl, or fruit, are characteristic, and the one design for setting a table barely does justice to a detail of dining, that, for long, pre-occupied the authorities. The eighteenth century books are full of such plates.

It is impossible, however, to exhaust a collection like mine in a single volume. I can only hope that what illustrations there are, together with my praise, all too feeble, of the irresistible text, will send the curious to the originals. ^Though, in self-defense, it might be wiser to restrain the ardor of the enthusiast until a few of the more glaring gaps on my shelves have been filled."

[[By_Night_Under_the_Stone_Bridge]]
*By Night Under the Stone Bridge* (1952, 1989)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
"By Night Under the Stone Bridge, the last novel from Leo Perutz to appear in his lifetime, reveals this polymath Austrian at the height of his extraordinary powers as a fabulist who could clothe the bare bones of history in the often-fantastic robes of magical realism.

The novel first appeared as Nachts unter der steinernen Brücke: ein Roman aus den alten Prague in 1952, predating by seven years the posthumously published Leonardo's Judas. It was republished by the Viennese house of Zsolnay in 1988, then in Eric Mosbacher's translation under the imprint of Collins Harvill (London, 1989) and Arcade Publishing (New York, 1990).

With the republication in the early 1990s of The Marquis of Bolibar (1920), The Master of the Day of Judgment (1921), Little Apple (1928) and St. Peter's Snow (1933), as well as Leonardo's Judas, the last decade of the 20th century saw something of a Leo Perutz revival. It was as though he had risen from the grave, like one of his demon-driven characters. He would have been amused, I think, at this literary resurrection.

By Night Under the Stone Bridge, like Tales from the One Thousand and One Nights - and many fables since - is a frame narrative. Made up of 14 linked stories told from different points of view, the novel is set in Prague at the end of the 16th century.

One night in 1598, the crazy Emperor Rudolf II wakes with a shriek in his bedchamber in the Hradschin Castle. Simultaneously, in the Jewish ghetto, "the beautiful Esther, the wife of Mordechai Meisl," dies in her Dreibrunnenplatz house just as the "Great Rabbi" of Prague plucks a rosemary plant, intertwined with a blood-red rose bush, from under the stone bridge over the Moldau River. The rosemary represents the Jewess Esther, the rose the Emperor Rudolf. The rabbi drops the white-flowered rosemary into the river, into the waters of futurity and infinity and of all time, sweeping it away and so lifting the plague that has afflicted the inhabitants of the ghetto.

By Night Under the Stone Bridge is a novel of great tenderness and savagery and beauty. Esther and Rudolf haunt one another's dreams (the emperor has glimpsed her while riding through the ghetto). Their affair is a kind of sexual metempsychosis, a transmigration of souls. When the emperor sends for the rabbi to tell him of this girl he must possess, the rabbi tells him, "That cannot be. ... She will not transgress against God's law. She is a Jewess, and will not become the beloved of any other man."

The emperor threatens the rabbi: "If you disobey my command, and I get no loving response from her who is ever in my mind, I shall expel all the Jews from my kingdoms and territories as a disloyal people, that is my decision and will, so help me God."

So the rabbi plants the "rose bush and a rosemary under the stone bridge … where they were hidden from men's eyes, and over both he spoke words of magic. And a red rose opened on the rose bush, and the rosemary flower nestled up to it. And every night the emperor's heart entered into the red rose and the Jewess's heart entered the rosemary flower."

Everyone in the novel, the emperor and his subjects, must pay for this act of magical transgression. As well as the plague, war is visited on the Holy Roman Empire. If at the level of historical realism By Night Under the Stone Bridge chronicles the events leading up to the Austrian defeat of Bohemia at the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620, it is impossible not to read the narrative as an allegorical representation of the Holocaust and of Perutz's own life.

Leo Perutz was born in Prague on Nov. 2, 1882, the eldest son of a textile buyer who took his family to Vienna in 1901. There, Leo would become a gifted mathematician (the Perutz equation is named after him), working as a statistician for an insurance company. (The comparison with Franz Kafka, employed as a claims adjustor for a Prague insurance company, is uncanny.) In Vienna, Perutz was a member of the Free Light Literary Association and contributed to pulp magazines. He published his first novel, The Third Bullet ( Der dritte Kugel), in 1915, after being shot in the lung while serving in the Austro-Hungarian army on the eastern front. In 1938, after the Anschluss, Perutz fled to Haifa, eventually settling in Tel Aviv. In the postwar years, he returned repeatedly to Austria, dying there in the spa town of Bad Ischl in 1957.

To call Perutz a magical realist doesn't really do him justice. Angels and demons, the faithful and the faithless, the loveless and the lovelorn throng his novels, which at one moment have a carnival air and at another are heavy with doom. (The Wandering Jew plays a key role in The Marquis of Bolibar, set among Spanish guerrillas under British orders in the Peninsular War.)

If Perutz's historical novels blend fantasy with an otherwise immiscible reality, his characters, as Austrian science-fiction anthologist Franz Rottensteiner has noted, "are frequently the victims of an implacable destiny, almost in the style of a Greek tragedy." The late Karl Edward Wagner, an American fantasy/horror editor and writer, thought The Master of the Day of Judgment, a psychodrama set in pre-First World War Vienna, one of the best non-supernatural horror stories ever written. Jorge Luis Borges made Perutz a household name in Argentina, and writers as varied as Ian Fleming, Graham Greene and Italo Calvino have praised his work. However, I think it fair to say he is not nearly as well known in the English world as Kafka, or Isaac Bashevis Singer, another writer with whom he has been compared.

What makes him special is the delicacy of feeling he wove into the warp of the inexplicable, a lyricism often missing in other genre writers. In By Night Under the Stone Bridge, the Great Rabbi is visited by the angel Asael, the Book of Enoch's fallen angel who introduced forbidden secrets to humanity. "At the beginning of time," the rabbi asks the angel, "did not the children of God go together in love with the children of men? Did they not wait for them at the springs and wells and kiss them in the shadow of the oaks and olive trees? And was not Naamah, the sister of Tubal-cain, lovely, have you ever seen her like?" The angel's thoughts, the narrative observes, "flew back through the ages to the very beginning of time."

"'Yes, Naamah, the sister of Tubal-cain, who forged clasps and gold chains, was lovely,' he said softly. 'She was lovely and she was delightful. She was as lovely as a garden in spring when day is breaking. Yes, the daughter of Lamech and Zillah was lovely. ...'

"And as he remembered the beloved of his distant youth, two teardrops ran down the angel's cheeks. They were human tears." - https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/a-transmigration-of-souls/article4277400/[Chris Scott]

"This brochure owes its existence to Mr. Power's Handy Book about Books, a large portion of which was reproduced in the American Bibliopolist. An examination of so much as Mr. Power had done on the subject of bibliography, led me to the conclusion that he had not made a personal examination of the books described, and that the eminent individuals, whom he thanks as having rendered him valuable assistance, must have had rather limited bibliographical resources; indeed, the general result was so disappointing that I determined to endeavor an improvement, and the result is the present list which is about four times the extent of Mr. Power's, and includes all the titles quoted by him, some of which we should have preferred to omit. Still it is not a complete bibliography, for the most excellent reason that such a work is beyond any one man's capacity; but it is hoped it will prove useful to those librarians and general readers who desire information concerning books about books.

Those who seek further information on the subject may consult with much advantage Petzholdt's Bibliotheca Bibliographica, which is conspicuous for the faithful and painstaking care exhibited in its compilation, and in which the titles are treated with that minute attention to classification which is preeminently the characteristic of the German mind, while our list is conspicuous for the absence of any attempt at such a classification.

I cannot close this brief notice without tendering my thanks to Mr. Charles A. Cutter of the Boston Athenaeum for his valuable aid. When librarians in general can approach his standard of library intelligence, there will cease to be that plentiful lack of knowledge by which some of them are now distinguished."

[[The_Novel_A_Biography]]
*The Novel: A Biography* (2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Novel-Biography-Michael-Schmidt/dp/0674724739/[+http://www.amazon.com/Novel-Biography-Michael-Schmidt/dp/0674724739/+]

*****
"Mr. Schmidt’s The Novel: A Biography is another one of those difficult books to review since it is, on the one hand, breath taking in its scale and on the other parochial in its subject matter. Breath taking, because it wishes to tell the history of the novel since its inception [evolutionary origins if you prefer], and parochial because the work wishes to focus on the English Novel. The latter goal is never, really, accomplished because so many novels, written in languages other than English have influenced the English Novel. There is, also, the problem of the antecedents of the novel that are not even mentioned – such as The Tale of Genji [a Japanese classic – published early in the 11th century…if you were to go by the still popular Gregorian Calendar—dating is its own political nightmare].

This being said, ‘The Novel’ is a fascinating attempt to tell the story of the novel in both a chronological and logical manner. Each chapter tends to follow a, generally, chronological motif, but within the chapter other authors are brought in as inheritors or antecedents of the work being discussed. What this does is to help the reader place the book in history and in its influence and, therefore, importance.

What is frustrating about Mr. Schmidt’s herculean effort [The Novel is just shy of 1200 pages– one more reason to read the eBook format…as if anyone needed another reason to prefer eBooks to print…but that is another argument] is that there are no endnotes…none at all. In many cases readers might be inclined to disagree or question the author’s assertions and these would help the astute reader to look up primary and secondary references. Anyone reading a history of the novel is likely to do just this – after all, ‘The Novel’ is a book written for aesthetes and nerds. Still, this history is fascinating and very idiosyncratic.

The author’s judgements of some writers can be highly dubious at times and at others he appears to be speaking truth to power. Statements such as: “What keeps Burroughs in print and talked about is the company he kept, the force of his rhetoric, and accidental nightmarish life he led.” Schmidt is also dismissive, generally, of the Beats and Kerouac in particular. Nonetheless, he gets it right when he refers to Salinger, via a quote of Lawrence Durrell’s, as a ‘cry baby’…though he refers Kerouac as this within the same quote. These judgements will make the blood of some boil, while others will find themselves nodding in agreement—still others mayn’t give a damn.

The major drawback to a book such as The Novel is that it is just too bloody long for most readers, and impossible to carry about in its physical form. Remember, readers read on the go—on the bus, subway, train, in line, the doctor’s office, while waiting for friends, etc. The sheer physical reality of the book does not permit this—this is, however, somewhat offset by the increasing popularity of eBooks. Most readers still prefer print, nonetheless, and this will limit the author’s readership. It might have been better to have broken it up into three or more books for the sake of mobility and the fact that many prospective readers would not be willing to tackle a 1,200 page book—perhaps they’re of the opinion they’ve a life to lead and obligations to meet.

Having said all of this, it is an important book, and one that should be read by anyone interested in the history of the English novel. The Novel should also, and most specifically, be read by Indie authors not having a firm grounding in the Canon, in all its mutant glory. After all, if you are going to write fiction you should be aware of the traditions you are writing in. Why Schmidt is important in this respect is that he does not consider the Canon to be made up of strictly Literary Fiction, but also includes important Genre authors as well. He is a little cautious with idea of Literary Fiction and Genre but that is another discussion—shouting match?

In the end, this history earns a respectable 4 out of 5 stars. The subtraction of one star is because of its length; its lack of references, and its sometimes-questionable aesthetics—see Burroughs and Kerouac, amongst others." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AUEXSRSIO8R7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674724739[David S.

*****
"Oxford has published a number of literary reference books, each with their strengths, weaknesses and biases. There are "Companions" to American literature and English literature, the gossipy and Brit-biased "Reader's Guide to Twentieth Century Writers," and now this prose atlas to the century's notable writers in English. It is, in a literary way, an embarrassment of riches.

Describing this extensive overview of everything worth noting about 20th century literature in English can be compared to the blind men describing an elephant. So much to cover, so many varieties of prose, and so little space to describe it all.

The giants are here, and if greatness is measured by the space allotted to them, then D.H.Lawrence leads, with two full pages dedicated to his achievements, followed by James Joyce, T.S. Eliot and Joseph Conrad (11/2 pages), Henry James (11/4 pages), and Graham Greene, William Faulkner and W.B. Yeats with one page.

At the other end of the fiction scale, where bestsellers reign, can be more problematic, with some authors worthy of inclusion (John Grisham, Scott Turow, Stephen King, a lonely line next to Barbara Cartland's name that refers the reader to the "romantic fiction" section) and others not (Michael Crichton, John Jakes, Danielle Steel). Genre writers tend to stand a better chance of inclusion, such as Georgette Heyer (romance), Jack Vance, Ursula K. LeGuin and Michael Moorcock (fantasy), J.G. Ballard, James Tiptree and Robert Heinlein (science-fiction), and Sara Paretsky, Tony Hillerman and John Mortimer (mystery).

Editor Jenny Stringer also went out of her way to include notable persons outside of literature -- The Beatles, Harvey Fierstein, Hunter Thompson, Tony Kushner and Theodore Veblen are in here -- as well as institutions, magazines and literary movements. Identifying these movements can sometimes be an exercise in deciphering obscure meanings. The entry on Modernism, for example, defines clearly its practitioners. Their works, however, "indicate the breach with the conventions of rational exposition and stylistic decorum in the immediate post-war period." Nowhere is there a phrase as clear as (and this is taken from an upcoming Oxford reference on James Joyce): "[Literary modernism] interrogates the legitimacy of traditional social institutions such as the family, the church and the state, rejecting their authority to prescribe and enforce moral standards of behavior."

Apart from that caveat, this Oxford Companion is a worthwhile aid through 20th century literature. Which one that is right for you depends entirely on where your taste in literature lies. It is only safe to say that there isn't a better guide anywhere."  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PFD5OZKVJMWK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0192122711[Bill Peschel]

*****
"t will be understood that the following pages are not presented as a Bibliography of. Sepulture and Sepulchral Inscriptions, but merely as a catalogue of such books on those subjects as in the course of my reading have come to my notice.

This catalogue is printed at the request of some friends desirous of having copies.

I am painfully conscious of the deficiencies of this compilation. A small additional expenditure of time might have corrected many defects. I had not the additional time to spare, and the question was either to print my imperfect notes as they were, or not to print at all. The former alternative prevailed, and my daughter arranged the following titles for the press.

I do not pretend to have so much as seen the majority of the books catalogued, and, judging from the number of misleading titles I discovered, I doubt not but many have escaped detection. A book advertised as "Church Yard Chips" proved to be a collection of essays by Thomas Churchyard: "Sutton's New York Tombs" turned out to be the description of a prison in New York, called the Tombs; Dostoviffsky's "Buried Alive," was a narrative of penal servitude in Siberia; Halpine's "Baked Meats of the Funeral," had no relation to funerals; "A Legal Mummy," was a lecture upon law; "William Reid, an Expert in the Art of Exhumation of the Dead, by Benjamin Rust"; I found to be an attack upon Reid for some comments of his upon a deceased relative of Rust's.

My excuse for earing in this field of literature is, I but follow the examples of, among others, the lawyers, Spellman, Bosio, and Collinson.

I beg to acknowledge my obligations for assistance derived from William Andrew's "Bibliography of Epitaphs," and to William Easies, Dr. J. A. F. Adams and Dr. Hugo Erichsons' "Bibliographies of Cremation."

Hazell's "Annual Cyclopaedia" (1886), states that "the literature of cremation since 1843 amounts to over 600 volumes, no mean share of them having been produced in England." I have met with but a limited number of these volumes.

I regret my inability at present to produce Part II, for if the compilation has any interest, it lies chiefly in the second part.

My friends will kindly take notice that I solicit additions to my catalogue and memoranda of errors."

"The first object of the Dictionary is to afford a handy, condensed
reference to the names of the authors written of and quoted in Noted Books or Current Literature, and to enable the reader to get at a glance the main facts of the lives of such authors and the titles of their principal works. But besides these, some thousands of additional names have been selected, which will be of service to the reader in many departments of intellectual activity. It has not been any part of the plan to attempt a comprehensive list of those who have written books; but, following the idea of similar works to present names, in many departments, fairly representative of literary history. While this general and cosmopolitan plan has been adhered to, considerable prominence has been given to American names, and to writers who have won distinction in works on law, art, travel, and exploration, and indeed in all liberal pursuits.

A literary dictionary, within the space at the editor's command, can only give a clue to the great maze of literature ; but in doing this is promoted the object of the whole work, which is to encourage, stimulate, and assist the general reader, not only in the acquisition of knowledge and the widening of his mental horizon, but in the rational enjoyment of life. The "promotion and diffusion of knowledge among mankind" has been held to be an object worthy of the highest human effort. To have contributed to this effort has been the purpose of those engaged in this work.

In preparing it the best authorities in many languages have been consulted ; but those familiar with dictionaries and cyclopaedias know how liable they are to err. If we have erred as to dates or names in this, it has probably been from having to make a choice between several authorities disagreeing and of good standing."

*****
Kangaroo Notebook is a difficult novel to understand, but you'll love it anyway. The plot is bizzare, to say the least. A man discovers that he has radish sprouts growing from his shins. His condition baffles the doctor at a local dermatology clinic, who sends him away in a self propelled hospital bed, telling him to try hot spring treatment. While en-route to the hot springs, he is cast down a dark tunnel and ends up on the shores of hell. From there, the plot gets really weird (but very addicting) as the narrator meets a child-demons, a vampire-esque nurse intent on drawing enough blood to win the "Dracula's Daughter" award, and an American photographer interested in achieving population contrl through traffic accidents.

The novel's symbolism becomes less obscure when one considers the great shame and self loathing "deformed" or "imperfect" members of Japanese society feel. Early in the novel, the narrator comments that marsupials are essentially inferior versions of mammals. The narrator, a terminally ill or deformed individual, feels like a marsupial, followed, wherever he goes, by his deformity (just as the narrator is followed by his hospital bed). At the novel's conclusion, the narrator sees himself in a box, perhaps a coffin, readers are presented with an exerpt from a newspaper regarding the discovery of a man found dead in a train station with self-inflicted slashes to his shins. The police, the article mentions, do not believe the slashes to the man's shins were the cause of death. The reader is left with the vague impression that the narrator, seeing his impending death, committed suicide (or perhaps was assisted).

Kangaroo Notebook is often compared to Burroughs' Naked Lunch or a cross between Kafka and Alice in Wonderland. I found the novel to be far more. Kangaroo Notebook is more than a strange story; it's an honest and deeply personal look into the mind of an individual whose disease is turning him (quite literally) into a vegatable. Read the novel, and see why Abe was considered Japan's leading author of modern fiction before his death. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R34R6TH7LWDAKJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679424121&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

http://www.amazon.com/Alphabetical-Africa-New-Directions-Books/[Amazon]

*****
Alliterative Analogies, assertively assembled, appear aplenty, appropriately, apt and artful, absorbing attention ad infinitum. This could be a fitting summary of Abish's stunningly "now" novel, written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between Kabbala and alliteration. Chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter A, Chapter 2 with A and B and so on until chapter 27, when Z first, then chapter by chapter all other letters, are progressively subtracted. In spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature, the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary, they may have been culled from today's headlines: polysexually inclined thugs hide in Africa after a crime spree, with the Author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them. Chasing after the thugs from country to country, we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite, war and genocide, corrupted burocrats and soldiers, rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air, where sparsely assembled people wollow in African Indolence. All is narrated with poetic detachment, in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social, political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality: it is just that the words were limited by my artifice, reader, the Author seems to smile. No harm intended. Perhaps: the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974, to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy. Great art, when unhindered, relates to the whole of time, in all tenses. While amusing, Abish has managed a ponderous read, which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices, inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events. Attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme. And wonder: was it accidental? "In order to be perfect, all I lack is a defect" goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV7LCBM76W9H1/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811205339[A Customer]

*****
The master journalist H.L. Mencken once wrote, "If you are against labor racketeers, then you are against the working man. If you are against demagogues, then you are against democracy. If you are against Christianity, then you are against God. If you are against trying a can of Old Dr. Quack's Cancer Salve, then you are in favor of letting Uncle Julius die. This novel is 23 years old; the Second World War ended over 59 years ago, yet the plot is still relevant today. It will be a long time before Germany as a nation, and the Germans as a people will be live apart from the legacy of Nazism and the atrocities and destruction that was wrought during those few years. While the descendents of the victims will continue to usurp the role of the victim, the descendents of the perpetrators will inherit guilt for the crimes, and then there are those who are not sure how they fit into this scheme from a historical perspective. The naïve, the disgruntled, the apathetic, and the nazis-new and old-exist side by side, this is the crux of "How German is it."
The setting of this story is a town that was once the site of a concentration camp. For posterity the camp has been leveled and a modern town has been built and named after Germany's most celebrated contemporary philosopher. The story surrounds a writer who is the son of a former high ranking German military officer executed for his role in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. While not a military story, this novel weaves through the daily activities of this man and the constantly reminders of the events past due to relationships both professional and personal, and a small band of terrorists, a very interesting plot.
Although written in 1980, terrorism is explored as a form of expression for the disgruntled. The author does a good job to explain how a government can tweak the circumstances and the fears surrounding terrorism to gain more power, allocate more funding, and remove personal freedoms. The characters are well developed in this very important novel for it covers events that are beginning to find there way into American society. Terrorism was a novelty in the United States in 1980 whereas it was already a common place event in the rest of the world. This novel will make you think about your lifestyle relative to the rest of the world. Very cleverly written. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXNDIRT8D249/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811207765&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Doug Maliszewski]

*****
This really caps off the Evadne trilogy brilliantly if unsatisfyingly. There's much food for thought here, about modernists and postmodernists, authorship, literature and pop fiction, and it does add up to a nearly fun mystery and a nearly poignant drama. Nearly a five star book, all told, you might say.

Adair really let's himself have it. If showy, humble-braggery prose like Adair's or similar's has ever irked you, you owe it to yourself to read this. Adair doesn't, in the end, take himself too seriously. But I fear this book, in which the pasticheur supreme takes himself to task and knocks himself down a peg, will never get the readership it truly deserves.

I haven't even digested the book yet, but I already look forward to re-reading the trilogy in a few years time. Good job, Gilbert.

*How to Defeat the Saracens: Guillelmus Ade, 'Tractatus quomodo Sarraceni sunt expugnand;' Text and Translation with Notes* (1317)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/How-Defeat-Saracens-Guillelmus-Translation/dp/0884023761/[Amazon]

*****
“How to Defeat the Saracens” is a fascinating text, originally written around 1317 by William of Adam (a.k.a. Guillelmus Ade), a churchman who had traveled extensively in the Middle East. William, a Dominican or perhaps former Dominican serving at the papal court, was styled “Archbishop of Sultaniye”, claiming (surely purely nominal!) jurisdiction over the Middle East, India and Ethiopia. His text proposing a new crusade to liberate the Holy Land is in effect a 14th century intelligence report. Modern historians consider it mostly accurate.

On one level, William's proposal for a full-scale crusade to defeat the Muslim Mamluk rulers of Egypt (who also controlled Jerusalem) was unrealistic. After all, no new crusade was launched at the time. On another level, however, his proposal is eminently realistic. Given the right amount of money, men and luck, none of his proposals are “out there”. I assumed that William's text would be some kind of fringe document written by a zealous crank. In fact, Brother William of the Dominican Order seems to have been an eminently practical man, often on the verge of Realpolitik pure and simple.

William identifies three main problems in the Mediterranean to be overcome before a new crusade could be launched: Christian commercial ties with the Mamluks, Christian pilgrims paying hefty tributes to the Muslims, and the collusion between Byzantium and certain Muslim rulers. Despite papal prohibition, Genoese and Venetian merchants had established lucrative trade deals with Egypt, providing the Mamluks with iron, wood, food and slaves. In this way, the Mamluks were able to replenish their armories, build new galleys, and expand their armies. (The Mamluks, a curious “slave dynasty”, were dependent on constant new imports of slaves for their military and administration.) Thus, the Christians were in reality arming their Muslim adversaries for cheap profit! Likewise, pilgrims visiting Jerusalem paid monetary tributes to the Mamluk rulers. Later, they would visit Cyprus and get absolution from the local archbishop. That the Byzantines were colluding with the Muslims is less surprising. Here, William's blinkered “Latin” perspective shines through. The fourth crusade in 1204, when Venetian-led crusaders had plundered Constantinople and set up a “Latin Empire”, would forever after poison the relations between Eastern Orthodox Christians and their Catholic counterparts. Yet, William, rather than recognizing the Orthodox, proposes yet another “crusade” to conquer and subdue Constantinople as a prelude to his projected attack on Egypt…

William proposes an immediate blockade of Egypt, what we would today call economic sanctions. He wants the Christian powers to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean with galleys, and demands the immediate excommunication of all Christians who continue doing business with the Mamluks or the Mamluk-allied “Golden Horde” in Russia (most of the slaves destined for Egypt were shipped out of southern Russia by the aforementioned Italian merchants). However, William is too realistic to think that purely spiritual or even political considerations are enough. He proposes impunity for anyone who plunders Christian merchant vessels destined for Mamluk ports. In effect, he wants to outsource the economic blockade to pirates. Of course, privateering wasn't a new idea, yet it feels somewhat curious to see a rank appeal to greed in a book written by a member of the Order of Preachers. William is particularly well-disposed towards the Zaccaria brothers, who controlled several islands in the Aegean (most notably Chios), from which they launched raids against merchant ships sailing between Egypt and the Crimea. The crafty archbishop also proposes to seize the money paid by pilgrims for their indulgences at Cyprus, and use them to finance the upcoming crusade!

William, like many of his contemporaries, hoped for a Latin alliance with the Mongol or “Tartar” Ilkhanids, then ruling most of modern-day Syria, Iraq and Iran. Despite their conversion to Islam, the Ilkhanids were enemies of the Mamluks. They were also ill-disposed to their ethnic brethren the Golden Horde in southern Russia. In this context, “How to Defeat the Saracens” contains one proposal that is apparently unique to William. His travels across the Middle East convinced him that Egypt's most important trade relations weren't with Europe or the Golden Horde Tartars, but with India. The port of Aden in Yemen was of pivotal importance at this trade route. William therefore proposes to build four galleys, attack Aden and then block the entrance to the Red Sea, in effect sneaking up on Egypt from behind. William had visited the area, and confidently reports that the inhabitants of Aden have weak defenses and an even weaker fighting-spirit. Also, there were Christian islands in the vicinity, including Socotra, from which armed attacks against Muslim shipping were already launched. Nearby Ethiopia was Christian, albeit not Catholic. The main problem with Adam's proposal should be apparent: how can Catholic galleys ever hope reaching the Red Sea? All land in between Europe and Ethiopia was controlled by Muslim rulers. However, the monkish intelligence operative thinks he has a solution even to this. While visiting Baghdad, he came across Genoese ship-builders working for the Ilkhan. Their ships could be safely sailed down the Tigris and thus reach the Indian Ocean. Thus, even the far-fetched proposal to block Egypt from both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea at once, turns out to be at least theoretically possible…

For whatever reason, the proposals contained in “How to Defeat the Saracens”, while certainly known in the higher echelons of the church hierarchy, were never implemented, at least not to such an extent that they made any difference. Christian Europe was probably too politically split to unite behind a far-reaching proposal of this kind, the attempts at “union” between Avignon/Rome and Byzantium mostly solidified the ill-will on the Byzantine side, and the trade or trafficking with the Mamluks was just too profitable to be easily given up by the parties concerned. (William, ever the realist, believes that the Zaccaria brothers should be granted an exemption, being allowed to trade with the Mamluks in order to obtain cash!) The attempts to forge an alliance with the Mongols also failed, and hence all hopes to take perfidious Aden by surprise.

That being said, “How to Defeat the Saracens” is one of the most fascinating texts I've ever read, and I warmly recommend it to anyone interested in the crusades and, of course, certain modern perturbations, none mentioned here. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZDLP854TK4L/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0884023761&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ashtar Command]

*Professor Baffin's Adventures* (1881)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
"PROFESSOR Everett Baffin, of Wingohocking University, and his daughter Matilda are bound for Liverpool aboard a ship laden with the latest inventions of Yankee technology. A shipwreck strands Baffin, his daughter, and their cargo on an uncharted island off England's coast. It transpires that, in King Arthur's time, this island broke off from England's shoreline: the inhabitants have remained culturally medieval ever since. Humor ensues when the professor astonishes the knights and damsels with demonstrations of his phonograph, telegraph, telephone, camera, and phosphorus-tipped matches.

Adeler's novel (reprinted as The Fortunate Island) strongly resembles Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, with Adeler using a "lost race" theme rather than time-travel to achieve his premise. The social satire in Adeler's novel is subtler than Twain's, although Adeler includes some slapstick pratfalls. There are some stark similarities between the two books: both novels feature a knight named Sir Sagramore. And Adeler got there first, beating Twain's 1889 Connecticut Yankee by eight years. Ultimately, though, Twain's version of this plotline does a better job of sustaining its humor and premise.

American humorist Charles Heber Clark (1841-1915) wrote several works of proto-sf (including the earliest-known feminist utopia story, in 1867) under the names "Max Adeler" and "John Quill." To his dying day, he was bitterly convinced that Mark Twain had plagiarized his work. In fact, after Mark Twain's death, a well-thumbed copy of Adeler's The Fortunate Island was found in Twain's personal library." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2007/cur0704.htm[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]

http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Serpents-Moons-Demetrio-Aguilera-Malta/dp/0380547678/[Amazon]

*****
This story was written in 1970 in Mexico by Ecuadorian Malta. It is written in authentic `magical-realism' style a la `100 Years of Solitude'. It is based in a fictional Latin-American town Santoronton, on the banks of a river and small island `Bahumba'; it's not clear when or which country this really is, though Zinc roofs suggest it is at least mid-1900s.
Santoronton is ostensively a normal rural town well populated by the usual suspects of such places: Colonel Candelerion (crocodile) the villainous rapist/murderer leader, witch doctor Bulu-Bulu (monkey) with daughter Dominga, Catholic Father Candido (with personal live wooden Jesus), families including the Quindales with daughters Chepa (a ghost) and Clotilde (bat), Dr Juvenico, secondary baddy bandit Chalena (toad). The town however has the story but also the magic to overlap events and personal animal similes (as indicated in brackets). The `real' animals appear to participate in the story.

The basic arc of the story is that the Colonel lusts after Chepa, he murders the family and rapes both daughters: Chepa (marries quickly but dies soon after) comes back to haunt him, what can he do?. The town is the centre of devil (`X-tail') activity with Chalena, who sold his soul?, controlling the water supply and ends up owning the town and people. The town rely on their religion Candido loses his church in a fire and the burned Crucifix comes alive; another Father comes to build a concrete church and falls in with the baddies. Candelerion is Candido's godson (if not son?). Clotide starts to entice men and castrate them, what can doctor Juvenico do to help her? Dominga needs a man to protect her from the tin-tins.

You might have been looking for another `100 Years' style of book - this is that book. The story is engaging and enthralling; add in the author's clear magical style which works very well because it's always there but not in an overpowering way - one can simply read the story as magical or preferably (form my point of view) clever analogy that expands events i.e. does the Colonel really turn into a crocodile and kill people so easily? .

Assuming you're into Latin American books you will not regret finding and reading this book. - http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A2BR5SWRUWUMPL/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp[H. Tee]

*****
Though often categorized as horror fiction, Robert Aickman's stories are so distinctive and so great that the only productive analogies people use for him are not the typical horror fiction writers (who often hugely admire him) but such actual literary greats as Poe, Kafka, and Dinesen. You often finish his stories not knowing quite what happened until you re-read them, and even then the strange ambiguities are so deeply unsettling that it's hard to explain the effect Aickman has had on you. For years he has been a well-kept secret among fantasy and horror fans, but Faber Finds's plans to reissue his stories and his one novel (THE LATE BREAKFASTERS) and one novella (THE MODEL) in 2014 in honor of his centenary should make him much more widely known, at least in the UK. DARK ENTRIES, which sports a gorgeously illustrated cover, is a fine place to start with Aickman because it was his first solo collection published in his lifetime (he had published a collection of stories with his one time girlfriend Elizabeth Jane Howard in the 50s), and features some of his finest stories, such as his deepest exploration into gender differences, "Choose Your Weapons," and the most famous (and anthologized) of all his stories, "Ringing the Changes."

The latter is a beautiful example of Aickman's mastery of the genre of the "strange tale" (as he preferred to call his work--he didn't care at all for the descriptor "horror fiction"). The story opens with a couple, mismatched in age, making a vacation trip to an out-of-the-way town in East Anglia that had been an important seaport in medieval times, before the harbor had silted up and pushed the town away from the sea. The town is largely deserted, and the few citizens the couple come across make oblique references to the couple being in danger; in the mean time a local old church begins ringing its bell for no apparent reason, and as the day wears on and the mystery of the town deepens, the ringing bell is joined by others, which intensify the overall sense of dread. When the truth about the town's abandonment and the reason for the bells is finally revealed, it is so almost offhandedly, as a kind of throwaway cliche: but then the truth of the statement (and the inability to turn back) digs in for both the couple and for readers. As is typical for Aickman's fiction, no other explanation is overtly given for the horrific event other than that it is happening, and the reader must try to make sense of it based on the circumstances of the story: the city's position almost displaced from time, the couple's age gap, the psychological condition of the husband and wife, etc. Even then you're never sure--and thus Aickman's story lingers longer in the imagination than the basic plot might in the hands of another fantasy writer (even H. P. Lovecraft, who also deals with a visitor stumbling onto the horrific truth about a seemingly nearly-deserted coastal town in his fine story "The Shadow over Innsmouth"). Robert Aickman is one of the finest British writers (and international masters of the strange tale form) in the 20th century: it is terrific seeing him made available to a broader audience. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWSFH1M9YO46/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571311776&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jay Dickson]

*****
This book was published in 1975 and was the fifth of the eight original collections of the author's short stories. The works in it date from between 1969 and 1975; all but one were from the early/mid-1970s, near the end of the author's career.

During his lifetime, Aickman published 47 short stories, and two more pieces have come into print since his death in 1981. His first tale came out in 1951; the pace of publication rose dramatically in the 1960s and 70s, and nearly half of his stories were published after 1970, in the last four original collections. For this reader, the best of his short works from throughout his career succeeded in balancing four elements: hypnotic developments and action; mesmerizing and dreamlike images that captured people's inner lives; an uncovering of the ways people behave toward each other; and a haunting, open-ended conclusion.

Model stories combining these things included "The Trains" (1951), "Ringing the Changes" (1955) and "The Swords" (1969). Almost as good were "The Inner Room" (1966), "The Visiting Star" (1966) and "The Hospice" (1975), despite extra layers of obscurity or developments bordering on parody. By comparison, many other pieces by the author often contained something memorable but felt lacking in one element or another. Another type of worthwhile story from this writer expressed something more of what might be called his philosophical outlook, and for me the clearest of these was "The Wine-Dark Sea" (1966). Others were "Into the Wood" (1968) and "The View" (1951).

The present collection contained just two of the tales from above: "The Swords" and "The Hospice," works about sexual initiation and death, and were mainly what made this collection worthwhile. The rest of the later pieces here, for me, were in the category of "not his best," comparatively lacking in depth and power. They were from a period -- the late 60s and after -- when the pacing of many of his stories seemed to grow increasingly deliberate, the text longer and the prose heavier. "Pages from a Young Girl's Journal," set in Italy in the early 1800s, was a rare story for Aickman in that it contained a vampire and took place abroad in the distant past. But it felt too obscure and didn't come close to rivaling something like LeFanu's "Carmilla."

Currently the cheapest options for assembling a large number of Aickman's short stories are the present collection plus three reprint collections: Painted Devils (1979), the Wine-Dark Sea's New York edition (1988), and The Unsettled Dust (1990). These four books contain 31 pieces altogether, including all but one of the stories named above. They're nearly two-thirds of his published tales, and all but four of the works from the first five original collections (We Are for the Dark, Dark Entries, Powers of Darkness, Sub Rosa, Cold Hand in Mine).

In this reader's opinion, Wine-Dark Sea and Painted Devils are the best places to start, since they contain work from the early 1950s through the late 70s, while Cold Hand is for those looking mainly for the writer's later, more deliberate tales. The Unsettled Dust contains some of his lesser stories from the late 1960s and two from 1980, including the three tales omitted from the Wine-Dark Sea's London edition (1990): "Bind Your Hair," "The Next Glade" and "The Stains." It's a pity that Cold Hand in Mine is currently the cheapest, most widely available collection for Aickman; it's not the most representative collection of work throughout his career.

Also, the generic cover doesn't do justice to this author. His writing would be complemented by the best work of counterparts in painting (Remedios Varo, Paul Delvaux, Kay Sage) or photography (Toshiko Okanoue, Maurice Tabard). - http://www.amazon.com/review/RTKWRAOXARA7D/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0899684165&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Reader in Tokyo]

[[Painted_Devils]]
*Painted Devils: Strange Stories* (1979)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Painted-Devils-Strange-Robert-Aickman/dp/0684159996/[Amazon]

*****
As a modern virtuoso of atmospheric horror, Robert Aickmaninjects each of his "strange stories" with a lingering, surreal terror. "Painted Devils" is all the more disturbing for the recurring themes that echo down the chilly corridors of this nine story collection. The most pronounced of these themes are doomed romance, communal hauntings, and abominable, monstrous offspring. A typical story begins with the protagonist venturing into the unknown, perhaps going to a new country or city, though sometimes the change is as simple as beginning a new job or visiting the theatre. There an unexpected friendship or love affair forms, and suddenly great gaps appear in the protagonist's conception of reality. In Aickman's world children are not always cute or even harmless, neither sex nor love brings contented bliss, and the dead don't always stay in the ground, nor are their spirits carted conveniently away to either heaven or hell.

In "The View," a man named Carfax is recovering from a vague illness. His doctor suggests taking a long holiday at an island retreat. On the boat Carfax meets a woman who is the sole inhabitant of a small mansion. She opens her home to him, and they slip effortlessly into an affair. Carfax is an artist and attempts several drawings around the mansion, becoming alarmed as the surrounding landscape seems to shift somehow from day to day. Carfax might live forever with his lover in their isolated paradise if only he could accept this disturbing, irrational phenomenon, but of course he can't.

"Ringing the Changes," probably an homage to Lovecraft's "The Shadow Over Innsmouth," tells of a honeymoon couple who choose their destination from a guidebook. This fateful decision leaves them stranded in the small, dreary, seaside town of Holihaven. The town is saturated with a terrible, fishy sea-stench; the water has rolled back far from the town, leaving a deep shoreline of muck; and worst of all, the odd inhabitants are obviously up to something infernal with their late-night bell ringing.

These stories have nothing to do with the heavy-handed, popular, shock horror usually associated with the genre. There are no movie monsters here, no blood-soaked demoniacs or ritualistic serial killers. Aickman's tradition is that of Lovecraft, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad, where the ambient eeriness is enough to stop a heart.

His signature technique is a sort of narrative ambiguity. If Aickman's characters lose their metaphysical footing along the way, so do his readers. For instance, in "The Houses of the Russians" a character has a close brush with fate outside a pub. Apparently he is nearly run down in the street, and his escape is something of a miracle. Yet Aickman never gives a clear picture of the scene. As the man enters the pub, we receive the incident secondhand, just as many of the pub's customers do. Aickman pulls the rug out from under us, initiating a momentum that sends us scrambling ahead for hearsay, conjecture, the smallest of details--anything that might restore balance. Once accustomed to his style, we realize that Aickman has managed to shake our imaginations free of their passiveness and has engaged us in an active relationship with his strange world. Then all that remains is to drift along in an alert but dreamy state with Aickman's voice as our only guide. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R18LPDVKQ6WA5T/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684159996&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

*The Wine Dark Sea* (1988)

*****
Robert Aickman was a writer of what he called 'strange stories', but of the eight stories in this collection 'The Fetch' is the only piece resembling a traditional ghost story. Aickman's work contains acute psychological insight; he is master of a unique and very modern form of horror where the protagonist often doesn't know what he or she has done to bring about disaster. This is seen at its starkest in 'The Inner Room' (the first story I read by Aickman and still my favourite - a truly haunting piece which will stay with me for as long as I live), and in the title story, where protagonist Grigg allows "the last living rock" be killed...but doesn't actually know what he did to let it happen.

The twentieth century was a time of disorientations, when Europeans were walking "on overgrown paths" as Knut Hamsun famously put it. So how is one supposed to act in such situations? There is something, a hidden room, to which we don't have access...

Aickman reveals subtle and ambiguous sympathies for fascism and Nazism in this book - admittedly far more ambiguous than those of Hamsun. In the final story of this volume, 'Into the Woods', a Polish officer asserts there was "darkness on both sides" in what Aickman describes elsewhere ('The Inner Room') as "the late, misguided war". And in 'Never Visit Venice' Aickman mentions an inscription left "by the previous regime" (i.e. Mussolini's) to the effect that a minute as a lion is preferable to a lifetime as an ass. This has been left up, not just for difficulty of access but also apparently for deeper reasons.

In 'Your Tiny Hand is Frozen', the central character Edmund St. Jude is a member of an old, aristocratic family, and an authority on obscure 18th century poets. St. Jude (named for the patron saint of lost causes?) struggles to fit in with his contemporary surroundings. This mirrors Aickman's own deep suspicion of modernity. In another story, a character observes that "the Greeks used to decorate their houses with flowers and sing songs. Now they buy tinsel from shops and listen to radios."

'Never Visit Venice' demonstrates Aickman's antipathy to the modern world at its starkest. Mass tourism has made the world into "a single place, not worth leaving home to see." The protagonist Henry Fern has something inside him which makes him different, something indefinable which he would like to be rid of, yet at the same time which he is sure is the best thing about him. This undefinable something acts as a barrier between Fern and other people, and holds him back in his career. He feels work and relationships are largely a charade, and one girlfriend accuses him of being "too soulful". He dreams of a woman with whom he attains understanding and affinity. But that woman turns out to be...Death.

"The city fathers are all dead. Everyone in Venice is dead. It is a dead city. Perhaps it died when 'Tristan und Isolde' was composed here." Aickman feels cut off from the feminine, something which emerges more explicitly in a story of his not included in this collection, 'Ringing the Changes' (which itself is something of a tribute to H.P. Lovecraft's 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth').

Aickman is not without humour, though, as shown in the grotesque and hilarious 'Growing Boys'. The boys' repulsive father, a hypocritical, Guardian-reading leftist called Phineas Morke, is seen by his own wife as resembling "an immensely long anchovy, always with the same expression at the end of it."

'Into the Woods' delves into more esoteric regions. This tale of insomniacs (read: initiates) whose knowledge makes them feared by the general populace is an allegory about finding the true Self, which very few ever do. The forest, or Self, has "no beginning or ending", similar to Jung's description of the Self as a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. This Self cannot be quantified, but contrary to the claims of certain totalitarian empiricists, it most definitely exists...and no one knew this better than Robert Aickman, one of the finest supernatural writers of the twentieth century. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DP46ATGF4JHK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557100357&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

[[How_I_Became_a_Nun]]
*How I Became a Nun* (2009)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/How-Became-Nun-C%C3%A9sar-Aira/dp/0811216314/[Amazon]

*****
The first two chapters are absolutely excruciating to read: incredibly well managed, funny, weird, tense, well conceived, and utterly bizarre. The narrator is a boy, but then again, he might be a girl: that's strange enough, because the ambiguity is managed offhandedly -- someone refers to the protagonist as "he," and someone else as "she." (The offhandedness of references to gender outdoes Yann Martel's attempt at the same insouciance.) The child is offered a strawberry ice cream. It's a special treat, because he, or she, has never had ice cream. He, or she, nearly gags on it, and Aira's description is intense and nauseating. And then -- this is only a "spoiler" for chapter 2, not for the rest of the book (and the information is available in published reviews) -- the father flies into a rage and kills the ice-cream vendor.

After that utterly unique start the book unravels, or rather, Aira relaxes into a sequence of set-pieces that could have been independent short stories. It's a Bildungsroman, and you follow the little girl, or boy, through various adventures to an ending that aspires to be as willfully strange as the opening.

I'd argue that the problem here is the lingering pernicious influence of magic realism. This isn't magic realism, because nothing is supernatural, and it's programmatically unromantic and unsentimental. But it's determinedly quirky and persistently exaggeratedly eccentric, and those traits, I think, are leftovers -- echoes -- of the little frissons and surrealist pleasures of magic realism.

Aira is a stupendously talented storyteller, and I intend to read everything of his that is translated. On this case, the form is episodic for no clear reason (why not a more linear narrative, when Aira shows he's a master of it in the first two chapters?), and the eccentricities are artificially concocted. (It's amazing that Bolaño liked him, because they are so different -- that makes me rethink Bolaño.) It will be interesting to see if his other books have different strengths, or if he is caught in a structureless collages of short-form set pieces. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACBPAQS5PZGZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811216314&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[James Elkins]

[[Ghosts]]
*Ghosts* (2009)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Ghosts-Directions-Paperbook-C%C3%A9sar-Aira/dp/0811217426/[Amazon]

*****
César Aira's 'Ghosts' is a book that, by design or no, is constructed from elements that reflect the in-between moments; the middle stages that make up the difference between departing and arriving, beginning and completion, life and death. It describes the afternoon and evening of the last day of the year, culminating at midnight - a moment that is part of neither the old or the new. Primarily, it follows the Viñas family - Chilean, but who are living in Argentina - temporarily living on top of a partially constructed building for which the father acts as the night watchman. Of this family, it is Patri, the oldest daughter, on whom the focus comes to rest. As the stepdaughter of the watchman - part of the family, yet also apart - and a teenager - neither child nor adult - Patri glides through the day until she receives a one time opportunity to attend a party like none other.

During it all, ghosts - neither a part of this world nor the next - drift in and out of the family's daily routine. I had not read any books prior to this one that adhered to the conventions of Magical Realism in literature (and as far as I'm able to determine, Aira does this quite competently), and honestly, I haven't yet formed an opinion about the technique. I do think it's a very peculiar way of telling a story, but one that, in certain instances, may allow the author the flexibility to express his ideas that typical methods might prevent. If I'd been looking for an example of this literary style, I probably would have started somewhere else, with one of its accepted classics, but I wasn't really aware that this was the medium in which Aira was working. For those who are already familiar with Magical Realism, you may wish to let your feelings about this manner of writing be your guide with 'Ghosts', as it seems fully entrenched in it.

Ultimately, I found Aira's work interesting but also frustrating. If his goal was to paint an image in my mind of the shape and texture of being 'in-between', then I think he succeeded, but if he was attempting something more than this limited objective, then I have to honestly admit that I was baffled. One section specifically, beginning with the description of Patri's dream and discussing the concept of the 'un-built' in architecture and literature, frankly had me holding on by my mental fingernails. Since the majority of the rest of the book is straightforward and focused on the daily routine of this family, I felt as though this expository section held all the necessary clues to Aira's thrust - and since I never made a solid connection, I feel as though I lost any deeper meanings the book contained.

I usually assign the blame to myself when I have this kind of difficulty, as long as the writer has proved his ability in other areas, which I think Aira does. And it's quite possible that there are some concepts that just do not translate well, despite the competence of the translator. In the end, César Aira is an author whose work I'll probably revisit - both to reread 'Ghosts', and, eventually, by picking up An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter (New Directions Paperbook) - and try to reestablish that connection after my initial response has worn away.

Lastly, although I know that cover blurbs are only a marketing device designed to sell books, I do get fed up with their misrepresentations, and try to point them out when I see them. In this case, a quote from Mark Doty on the back cover claims that "Aira is firmly in the tradition of Jorge Luis Borges and W. G. Sebald". I don't know exactly what the context is for 'in the tradition of', but the implication is that if you like one, then you'll like the other. From the little I know about Borges, that half of the claim may be apt, but I find almost nothing similar between 'Ghost' and in the work I've read of Sebald. My snap impression is that the author of the quote randomly selected a name (Sebald) that is known but not yet widely read (popularly obscure?) - either to impress with his ranging knowledge, or to steer readers of one author to another at the request of the publishers. Perhaps I'm being unfair - but hearing the justification for such a comparison would be fascinating. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R1WEFZK0QKF038/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811217426&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bryan Byrd]

[[The_Literary_Conference]]
*The Literary Conference* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
Do you like innovate, avant-garde fiction polished superfine? Introducing César Aira from Argentina, author of dozens of quirky, quizzical, lyrical novellas and novels, many translated into English, his best known An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, a surreal yarn of a nineteenth century German artist's travels in Latin America and Ghosts, a tale about a haunted luxury apartment complex in the city of Buenos Aires.

Why haven’t I heard of César Aira before? Perhaps because he takes delight in being somewhat obscure. As he stated in an interview, nearly half of his ninety titles are pamphlets or booklets, many less than twenty pages. Since by his reckoning every story is a book, he prefers small, independent publishers willing to print a limited run. Therefore, he surmises, if someone really wants to read his books, they will find them.

I'm delighted I did just that! The Literary Conference is my first César Aira and it will certainly not be my last.

I was under the impression The Literary Conference would be about, well, a literary conference, featuring famous Latin American authors discussing the aesthetics of literature. I found to my astonishment, what begins as international adventure shifts to a comic version of mad scientist taking over the world via cloning and then again to B-movie, a science fiction monster flick, all the while offering meditations on the nature of art and creativity - contained in a mere eighty-five pages.

The narrator, a playwright with the name César, travels to Venezuela, to the coastal town of Macuto wherein he solves the centuries-long enigma of the Macuto Line and its sunken treasure. Just the right vibration from his fingers on the old hemp line and ta-da! - treasure miraculously falls at his feet. My sense is this piece of authorial legerdemain serves to remind us we are, after all, being told a tale and if the storyteller wants riches at the feet of César (perhaps César Aira himself?), then that’s what will bloody well happen.

Moreover, the Macuto Line could be taken as metaphor: the author engaging his imagination as the rope to guide himself down to the lower depths of his own psyche in order to mine a treasure chest of images and words he can bring to the surface and thus compose the very novella we are reading.

We arrive at the actual conference itself, not exactly a round table discussion, more an extension of César’s internal dialogue. One of the first observations made is how the tale he is relaying must be kept clear since poetic fog horrifies him. However, he acknowledges a fable provides the foundational logic for his story and that fable requires the underlying logic of yet again another fable. And the story we are reading provides the logic for a second story. Does all this Russian dolls story within a story remind you of anything? It does for me: One Thousand and One Nights of Scheherazade, among César Aira’s favorite modes of storytelling.

César goes on to relate how there was once a mad scientist who allowed the clones he created to roam the streets of his neighborhood. Ultimately the mad scientist needed CONTROL and the best way to maintain such control was to clone a superior man. And what will be the nature of such a superior man? Ah, according to the mad scientist, an individual having achieved greatness in the realm of high culture, things like philosophy, literature, history and being steeped in the classics.

César then reveals the truth: the mad scientist in question is none other than himself. And who does César judge the superior man fit for cloning? Why, of course, that giant of world literature – Mexico’s Carlos Fuentes. Permit me a side note: a number of years ago American men and women were asked what individual should be cloned to improve the quality of life within the United States. The results were divided: half the Americans polled voted for Albert Einstein and the other half for Michael Jordan. Perhaps a combination of both would be ideal - theoretical physicists who could tear up a basketball court.

Whacky weird, bugged out bizarre and Kool-Aid kooky from here on out. Thus I will shift from the narrator's singular story to a number of his reflections sweetly seasoning this literary conference confection. Firstly, how “language has shaped our expectations so extensively that real reality has become the most detached and incomprehensible one of all.” Indeed, our view of ourselves and others, our notions of life and death and everything in between is a combination of fact and fiction. And because we coat our world with the thick syrup of language, I suspect the split is along the lines of 2% fact, 98% fiction.

“My Great Work is secret, clandestine, and encompasses my life in its entirety, even its most insignificant folds and those that seem the most banal. Until now I have concealed my purpose under the accommodating guise of literature.” Hmmm, is the narrator (César Aira himself?) suggesting there is an underlying riddle to be solved along the lines of Hugh Vereker’s literary puzzle in Henry James’ The Figure in the Carpet? What a tantalizing prospect! No wonder a number of literary critics have linked Aira with his fellow countryman, Jorge Luis Borges.

“I was considering, with amazement, the quantity of things that were happening to me while nothing was happening. I noticed this as my pen was moving: there were thousands of tiny incidents, all full of meaning. I’ve had to pick and choose carefully, otherwise the list would be endless.” Thank goodness César can choose wisely; otherwise The Literary Conference might include enough peregrinations, colloquies and bagatelles to fill hundreds of pages.

“Only through minimalism is it possible to achieve the asymmetry that for me is the flower of art; complications inevitably form heavy symmetries, which are vulgar and overwrought.” At eighty-five pages, The Literary Conference undoubtedly qualifies as minimal in terms of length. And César Aira’s style is the opposite of heavy, vulgar and overwrought; rather, the author has created a little book chock full of ideas and philosophy that’s sheer fun, all within a breezy storyline too preposterous to be read without a smile. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R271TWKCFBDE78/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811218783[Glenn Russell]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Lasts-More-than-Hundred-Years/dp/0253204828/[Amazon]

*****
Aitmatov is a Kyrgyz writer who passed away this year. I have never heard of him or his books, but a friend recommended this book to me recently. As is usually the case with friends' recommendations, this book turned out to be a real gem.

The story takes place over the course of one day, and includes one major plot and one short sub-plot. Yedigei, a railroad worker in remote Kazakhstan, sets out to bury his old friend, Kazangap, in an old cemetery. Throughout the long journey to the cemetery, Yedigei recounts his personal history and that of the few other souls that live with him at the remote railroad station. The shorter sub-plot involves the discovery of extraterrestrial life by an American astronaut and a Soviet cosmonaut. The location of the Soviet launch site near Yedigei's station serves as the background for this science-fiction background story.

I will not go into the plot itself; it is far too elaborate and clever for me to try to summarise it in a few short paragraphs. Aitmatov paints an achingly beautiful picture of hardships of life in the remote steppes of central Asia under Soviet rule. He succeeds in describing the rich tradition and history of the local people and how their culture and practices are challenged by the laws of the Communist regime. The animal world plays a major role in the story, with Yedigei's camel, Karanar, being one of the main characters in the book. There is an ever-present criticism of the Soviet regime, but it is so subtle that the book does not become an anti-government manifest.

The sub-plot about the extraterrestrials seems, at first, to be entirely disconnected from the main story. However, as details about the discovery become more apparent, and especially the reaction of the leaders of the USA and the USSR to the discovery, it all comes together. Yedigei's earthly worries and dealings are interwoven with galactic events, to make a strong statement about the human condition. The past, present and future are interwoven in an intricately designed masterpiece.

It's hard to do justice to this book by attempting to review it. I learnt a lot about Kazakh culture and the hard-working rural inhabitants of the Sarozek desert. But mostly I learnt that one can tackle the big questions in life through a simple story. In two words, my recommendation is: read it. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B373YC9LG7H5/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0253204828[Asher Gabbay]

[[Other_City]]
*Other City* (2009)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Other-City-Czech-Literature-Series/dp/1564784916/[Amazon]

*****
The Other City by Michal Ajvaz is by far the oddest book I have read this year and it has been quite a year for odd books. But where Smith's Only Forward and Harkaway's The Gone-Away World was odd because of the absurdity and, in the case of the latter, randomness found within, The Other City is odd because it presents a world of wonderment that exists all around us and that we willingly blind ourselves to. It is a world that is so alien to ours that a jungle can exist in a closet, that armies gradually turn into coats, and passenger ships voyage through the space between bookshelves. It is random and it is absurd, but unlike the aforementioned, it is not used for humor, nor is it strange for the sake of strangeness. Rather, the absurdity and the randomness is used to craft a fringe world so curious and surreal that it sucks the reader into its labyrinthine spaces, just as it does the narrator.

The most fascinating thing about this book, in terms of writing and not story, are the paragraphs. In our internet culture it is not uncommon to stumble across some post on a forum or a blog or wherever you may be that does not have a character or word limit that consists of one massive paragraph, Most refer to it as a wall of text and they are right to do so. No one likes them, no one wants to read them, and it is frustrating for all. I feel the same about books, mostly because the longer I read without some break the more likely I am to become distracted by thought or something shiny lurking across the room and have my concentration shatter to a thousand pieces. This was one of the main reasons I stopped reading Zelazny's The Guns of Avalon.

The Other City erupts spontaneously into pages-long passages consisting of one paragraph, usually of dialogue. This is something that I would expect to grate on my nerves, to frustrate me until the only end possible: putting down the book. Further, the passages are rambling and random, only just bordering on the edge of coherence and trying to figure out if it would rather hop the low fence and dance off into the chaos of insane gibberish. But, oddly enough, I found that I was not put off by these passages or by the fact that they were walls of text, horrendously long walls of text. It was just the opposite, in fact. Instead I was drawn deeper into the story, into the spaces between apartments and the underground chapels filled with aquarium statues, and before I knew it I was rushing headlong through these surreal narratives filled with the weird, wondrous, and fascinating. There were no breaks, no pauses, just the sustained, relentless, narratives that led on and on down the rabbit hole.

Which is not to say that I did not have my issues with the paragraphs. I soon discovered that I needed to devote my full attention to the book and in such cases everything becomes a distraction. There were times when either my mind would wander off on some loose thread or someone would interrupt me and I would be forced from the book. I returned to the passage only to find that I could not remember where I left off and the entirety of it was little more than a hazy recollection, which lead me time and time again to reread the entirety of the passage. Although, this is not to say that others will have the same issue with the book or have had the issue for that matter, it just proved a problem for me. Though I definitely do not hold it against it, as I feel the benefits gained from these overlong paragraphs far outweigh any negatives.

I also had an issue with the main character, our narrator, who seemed rather detached from everything. His various encounters with the other city are strange to start with and become increasingly bizarre as the novel progresses, yet there are very few times in which our narrator actually appears to be at all affected by any of it. There are a few times when he expressed wonder or is panicked and at the dead end of the novel he delights in the thoughts of all the oddities he might find, but beyond that he seemed to take everything in stride, as if everything was as it should be. Ah, but then there is metaphysical discussion of windows in the book that lends to why he may be more inclined to accept the other city more readily than others, so is this complaint even valid? I like to think it is, that even one who is inclined toward accepting an alien reality would still express a greater level of wonderment at what he finds.

A final issue: there were times when the same word might be repeated half a dozen times in one (shorter) paragraph. It is not a major issue, but it was distracting and, as I said before, The Other City is not the kind of book that takes well to lax attention. It being a translated work, I am not exactly sure who is responsible for the the repetition, Ajvaz or the translator. In the end, it does not really matter as it took nothing at all away.

The Other City is one of those books that show up from out of nowhere with not a bit a talk circulating around it and very few reviews. A shame, really, because books like this should be talked about, made known, and brought to the attention of unassuming readers everywhere who have no idea what they are getting into. More than that though, it is just an excellent piece of translated fiction, though I will be the first to admit that I am woefully uneducated in such areas, and a highly enjoyable read. I have no idea if Dalkey Press will be translating and releasing more of Ajvaz's work, but I look forward to getting my hands on it if they do. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLIL5CVAJ3R8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564784916&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[James Oliver]

This dense little book took me much longer to read than I had anticipated by both the length and the description. I expected a light romp through the everyday experiences of the islanders and a longer foray into the "book" around which the island appears to be focused. Instead, I found an intellectual, philosophical, and incredibly thoughtful mock travelogue. The island of which the narrator speaks has an influential method of living, which pervades every aspect of the islanders lives, from their history, to the food that they eat and how they prepare it, to their so-called occupation, to their architecture, etc. This is initially described by the narrator, but as the travelogue proceeds, it becomes ever more apparent how pervasive the islanders' life view is.

The only exception to the islanders' seemingly lackadaisical and irreverent style of living seems to be their "book" -- the one "artform" that appears on the island. The book is what most of the reviews seem to focus on, logically so. Although "the book" itself is not really discussed and experienced until at least halfway through the travelogue, it is the most interesting and even unique aspect of the islanders life. Yet, even though "the book" is not really discussed until later in the travelogue, the first half of the travelogue is clearly necessary as background, so that "the book" is fully understood and appreciated. "The book" itself is interesting, but the tales within are absolutely fascinating. The reader almost feels as if he is losing sight of the beginning of any given tale, as it spins and diverges, but Ajvaz is skilled at bringing his reader full circle -- even if we need to wait a few more pages than is common. The wait, as Ajvaz himself notes, is often worth it, and the tale (within the tale within the tale...) is always rewarding.

Michal Ajvaz is a master at his art and has created a world that operates almost completely outside of most societal norms. He is adamant that he imparts no overall judgment either on the islanders or on the rest of the world, and I was convinced of his assertion. For me, the best parts were the divergent tales, both within "the book" and without. However, although the rest of the travelogue was not as "fun" as those tales, they were interesting and necessary to the whole.

I would not categorize this as "light reading," but I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for something different, something a little chewy, and something to make you pause and think. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GRTQSOFX2TS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564785785&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

*St. Burl's Obituary* (1997)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/St-Burls-Obituary-Daniel-Akst/dp/015600514X/[Amazon]

*****
Burl is a richly drawn, unforgettable character. At once petty, superficial and yet deeply integrated, suffering from life's basic problems, of course, a need for love - and to find his purpose in life.

When the woman of his dreams makes a half-joking proposal, he struggles to respond, and then is kicked into further action by an accidental involvement with the mob. This sets off his cross country journey, which he frames as a duplicate of Joseph Smith's, and the growth of the Mormon church of all things. This interest of his is only a side subject in the novel, but is a brilliant setting for the middle part, his adventures in Salt Lake City.

I gave four stars because it begins to drag a bit from middle toward the end, but it really picks up at the climax and there is great payoff as Burl finds and loses and finds yet again his love, and ultimately the answers to his life's biggest (pun intended) mystery.

The best thing about this book is the refreshing brilliance of the language. The author does not talk down to the reader, and you may require a dictionary a time or two, and Google translate if you have no acquaintance with the French language.

New York City is richly presented, and is stark contrast to Utah. The story is packed with various peoples, personalities, orientations, and even a cult experience. The culinary dimension alone is magnificent and a central fixture to the story. If you have no interest in that subject, I do not recommend this book, because you will find the detailed descriptions of food and drink tedious. But if you enjoy that subject at all, the focus on food is endlessly amusing. It is of course, because that is Burl's great focus.

The fun part is watching his intellect and emotions grow, decay, simmer and stagnate, as they parallel his food obsession. Burl seems to grow not at all throughout the novel, yet actually undergoes huge transformations, perhaps because they are under the surface of his awareness, despite their obviousness and how much he thinks about them. His soul mate, Norma, is equally endearingly clueless. The characters are quite ridiculous, which makes the story border on hilarious throughout.

Not least is the very serious subject of obesity, which the author manages to poke fun at while simultaneously showing the great suffering caused by society's prejudice of "fat" people, and their physical pain and disability. Yes, the story seems to be about gluttony, but in the end, it isn't. Burl does not actually deliberately overeat. Well he does but he can't help it. He is driven as like a dog's olfactory food drive. The reader is made quite aware of the tempting abundance of food in, specifically, the City and by extension, all of America. Due to the publication date, the stance on nutrition is a bit outdated, if you've kept up with latest research, but the idea is valid - we've access to a lot of foods that are making us sick.

Maybe the most important theme of this story is that of pleasure, that we need to live in the moment, stop and smell the roses as it were, but what do we do when these pleasures are endangering our health? See how Burl handles this dilemma.

I just finished my second read of this book and will probably read it a third time eventually. Be warned if you don't like to read descriptions, maybe consider some a bit purple, some telling not showing, but worth it to me anyway. - https://www.amazon.com/St-Burls-Obituary-Daniel-Akst/product-reviews/015600514X/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent[bterrier]

Aksyonov's "Island of Crimea" has an interesting premise. What if Crimea were an island, instead of a peninsula. Further more, what if Crimea was the only area of Greater Russia to hold out against the Reds, and become a multiethnic "free" zone? Set in an alternate 1970s, The Island is a international hotbed of capitalism(like Hong Kong of old), but many want to rejoin Russia, under an idea of Common Fate. The people form a party called SOS. Also, there is a group of youngsters who want to have their onw identity, a Russian-Tatar mix called Yaki. In the background, various Russians plot, some for reunification, some against. Aksyonov almost had me spellbound, but the hero was too decandent, and some things made no sense what so ever. - https://www.amazon.com/Island-Crimea-Vassily-Aksyonov/product-reviews/0394727657/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=recent#R3L5MFY1VY20LQ[Peter LaPrade]

*The Burn* (1984)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Late-Sixties-Early-Seventies/dp/0394524926/[Amazon]

*****
Thomas Pynchon is the first writer that springs to mind after reading the first few pages of The Burn. Then slowly you discover that this incredibly eclectic panoply resonates with Laurence Sterne, James Joyce, J.P.Donleavy, John Barth, Ken Kesey, Phillip Roth, Saul Bellow. The Burn is undoubtedly the first truly serious effort by a major contemporary Russian classic to transcend the constraints of culture topologies and hermeneutics pushing the translator's job into the realm of the impossible. Should it be "translation proper", or "transmutation", or "partial tranformation" or some symbiotic balance between the three? To what extent the attainment of this serendipity could be enhanced by total immersion and participant observation? A simple example. In the first chapter of The Master and Margarita thirsty Berlioz accompanied by the poet approach a kiosk and are offered a lukewarm fruit lemonade. So far so good. Then Bulgakov writes: suddenly both were overwhelmed by the smell of a barbershop(translation is mine). Images and associations of what barbershop does it invoke? Downtown Moscow beauty parlors and saloons today are redolent with Estee Lauder and Ralph Lauren, so what does the reference really connote, could it be just skipped as something of marginal significance or even complete irrelevance? Indeed, the barbershops with cheap cologne that smelled like fruit lemonade have long been gone, but I still remember the tonsorial establishments of the early fifties and that provides an olfactory input to supplement and augment the semantics. This builds a springboard for free association whose crazy kaleidoscope takes me on a journey down the memory lane, and bingo, here I am ensconced in a chair in a barbershop that smells like Bulgakov's lemonade. The Burn is undoubtedly, a colossal enterprise,it's cerebral, witty, hilarious, extraordinarily elegant and scandalously bawdy, a seminal book by all standards. I have yet to read its English translation by the impeccable Michael Glenny to compare notes, so to speak. However I have a strong suspicion that no matter how brilliant the translation, only a reader possessing the highest level of cross-cultural literacy could make a connection. Which brings me to another interesting point, Conrad and Nabokov both wrote in English. Nabokov once made an interesting comment in an interview, he said(this is not a quote, just a paraphrase) that he could write a perfect description of a sunset or a crawling insect, however the problems arose if he were to ask directions to the nearest convenience store. The proverbial barbershop again! - https://www.amazon.com/review/R25F325QWK14BB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394524926&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ilia Toumadjanov]

*****
"La Regenta’s first line - “The city was taking a nap” – hooked me. Alas follows this with an ingenious, almost cinematic device, as young canon-theologian Don Fermin de Pas mounts the church tower of the sleepy Asturian city of Vetusta and withdraws from his cassock a long object - given blatantly phallic suggestiveness enhanced already by the tower itself - that initially frightens one of the two boys hiding in the belfry. It’s merely a telescope, which Don Fermin trains onto the town below to spy upon its inhabitants. The scene serves as a fine example of Alas’ ability to compound humorous irony and sexual symbolism with both straightforward realist narrative and a more meta-fictional suggestion of the author’s role, his own intent to survey the goings-on of Vetusta. Over the next 700 pages, Alas picks apart this provincial city to reveal its upper class as semi-aware somnambulists, preoccupied with gossip and social machinations, pressed between civic and religious institutions, and largely at the mercy of an entrenched psychosexual dynamic that manifests itself in a Don Juan-style lecherousness or a paralytic state of wretched and crushing repression." - http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2014/08/to-point-of-bursting-leopoldo-alas-la.html[Seraillon]

*****
"Barefoot in the Head is one of the finest things to emerge from the wreckage of the 1960s.

It is not by any means an easy read, indeed it is far more experimental in forms and style that many more feted non-sf avant-garde works. The prose and poems (some of which individually are really fine pieces of work) and songs and at times simply patterns of letters that compose the work are fragmentary and fractured - the ravings of minds changed beyond recognition by mind-altering psychotropic weapons. Yet somehow it makes sense: the wrong words start to mean something, you start to establish a vocabulary from random or mistaken strings of words and, although how I am not quite sure, you can even get a deep sense of story and character thorugh all the confusion. At times you just have to sit back with a wry smile and know that Aldiss deserves so much more than to be continually ignored by the snobbish mainstream critics: this guy is a British national treasure, and one of the great writers of the late Twentieth Century in English. The degree of sheer literary craft involved in this work is quite remarkable.

This is a book about culture and religion and drugs and technology and war and so much more: as such it stands with Burroughs' Naked Lunch. Dick's A Scanner Darkly and Delaney's Dhalgren as monuments to the ambiguity of the breakdown of both mind and order and dark side of pure freedom. But somehow it is more adventurous and more daring than any of these works." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K0AWSMIITPM7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=057124646X[flying-monkey]

*Fantomas* (1915, 2006)

*****
Fantômas is everywhere. He is a master killer, a criminal genius, capable of being in multiple places at once. He can pretend to be anyone - even female - or so the story goes. And there are many, many stories of Fantômas. He is the everyman killer.

Or so Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre, partners in writing, would have the reader believe when they created Fantômas, in 1911. A massive success, the two would go on to write thirty-one more Fantômas novels after the first, and when Souvestre died, Allain wrote eleven more. Parisian appetite for stories of Fantômas's dastardly deeds was insatiable, 'a work of popular fiction whose popularity cut across all social and cultural strata', says John Ashbery, who wrote the introduction to the Penguin Classic edition.

Fantômas was the first novel in a series written by the Allain and Souvestre. It catapulted the genius criminal to stratospheric popularity, as well as all but creating the modern criminal novel. The plot revolves around the mysterious killer, of whom very little is known at the beginning - and, delightfully, even less is known at the end. Indeed, the antagonist throughout the novel may not even be Fantômas, one of the many strokes of genius in this novel.

Charles Rambert waits anxiously to meet his father, who he has not seen in many years. The evening before his father's arrival, Charles learns the story of Fantômas, a master criminal who may or may not exist, who may or may no longer be active as a killer. Excited by these stories, he sleeps poorly, and in the morning, after he has collected his father from the train station, it is revealed that the Marquise de Langruen has been brutally murdered. 'Mme. de Langrune's throat was almost entirely severed by the blade of some sharp instrument. The breadth and depth of the wound absolutely prove that it was not made with one stroke; the murderer must have gone amok and dealt several blows'. Suspicion is placed on the only logical shoulders - Charles.

Princess Sonia, 'not pretty but lovely', is bathing in a hotel room, alone. Suddenly a man grips her arm, covers her mouth with his hand. A conversation, witty, calm, urbane, intelligent, menacing, ensues. Sonia is robbed, the thief escapes. Later, Lord Beltham, missing and presumed dead, is found in the abandoned home of Gurn, a mysterious traveler not often seen at his home. More suspicion is piled on Charles' absent shoulders until he, too, is found murdered in a river, fished out of the water by a vagabond.

The man working on all of these cases is Juve, a single-minded, bloody-minded detective who has hunted Fantômas for years. 'There was not a single person who had not heard of Juve and his marvelous exploits, or who did not regard him as a kind of hero.' We do not learn much of Juve's personal life because we do not need to - it is sufficient to the novel that he is a man obsessed, driven to capture the most elusive of all prey.

The story is told at a number of locations around Paris. Often, we know less about what is happening than Juve, who seems always to be one step ahead of the reader, the other characters - but never Fantômas. A scene will develop with the slightest of links to the main arching story, but then a sudden twist and we are back firmly within the realm of Juve and Fantômas as they struggle to outwith the other. Allain and Souvestre manage to keep a tight rein on the plot in this manner, always curling the story back to its central conceit.

For a novel that deals with a shadowy murderer who may or may not exist, the ending is brilliant. We are left with a clear, defined killer and a clear, defined victory for Juve - but was the captured murderer really Fantômas? The final twist is shocking, touching and very sad. Tension mounts until it is almost unbearable, with the final pages allowing a number of further adventures - forty-two more, in fact.

Fantômas was written to a deadline, following a careful sequence decided beforehand by the two authors. It is important to remember that they went on to write nine more novels that year. That Fantômas is of such high quality is remarkable. I cannot personally vouch for the remaining forty odd novels, but the series certainly began on a high note. For fans of the crime/thriller genre, this novel is recommended to see where it all began. For fans of fine literature, this novel is recommended as an important novel in the progression from gothic to contemporary popular literature. Recommended for all, in other words. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LC0DEDVEHBR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143104845&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Damian Kelleher]

*****
ALPHONSE ALLAIS (1854-1905) was a peerless French humorist, celebrated posthumously by the Surrealists for his elegant style and disturbing imagination. In addition to composing absurdist texts for newspapers such as LE CHAT NOIR and LE JOURNAL, he experimented with holorhymes, invented conceptual art, and created the earliest known example of a silent musical composition: FUNERAL MARCH FOR THE OBSEQUIES OF A DEAF MAN (1884). Truly ahead of his time (as well as ours), Allais is needed now more than ever. His mischievous work remains fresh, funny, and always surprising. - https://www.createspace.com/4342129[Black Scat Books]

Alphonse Allais (1854-1905) was France's greatest humorist. His elegance, scientific curiosity, preoccupation with language and logic, wordplay and flashes of cruelty inspired Alfred Jarry, as well as succeeding generations of Surrealists, Pataphysicians, and Oulipians. THE SQUADRON'S UMBRELLA collects 39 of Allais's funniest stories -- many originally published in the legendary paper LE CHAT NOIR, written for the Bohemians of Montmartre. Included are such classic pranks on the reader as "The Templars" (in which the plot becomes secondary to remembering the hero's name) and "Like the Others" (in which a lover's attempts to emulate his rivals lead to fatal but inevitable results.) These tales have amused and inspired generations, and now English readers can enjoy the master absurdist at his best. As the author promises, this book contains no umbrella and the subject of squadrons is "not even broached." - http://www.amazon.com/The-Squadrons-Umbrella-Alphonse-Allais/dp/0692392122/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
I'm sometimes a language purist, I don't like to toss around the word "unique" lightly. But this classic book (I had to read it for my major, that makes it a classic) really is unique for its time, 1834. For one thing, there's the kaleidoscopic format: it starts out as a fairly standard 19th-century epistolary novel, telling a story of romantic jealousy by means of letters between two sisters and their young men; it then turns to straight narrative and brings in political intrigue, includes some song and poetry, and after a while settles into mostly drama format--pure dialogue, that is, with scarcely any narrative text. And then there's the historical elements: the assassination of King Gustaf III of Sweden(!) at a masked ball(!!) in an opera house(!!!)--the most historical parts of the story become its most fantastic.

But most of all there's Tintomara, the androgynous figure with whom each of the four young leads falls in love--the metaphor within the book is the card, the five of hearts, one heart in the center and one in each corner, which get erased one by one. (Let's just say that the card metaphor goes beyond mere foreshadowing to become lampshading.) Tintomara his/herself is an androgyne, both sexes in one, and as such complete and not needing anyone else; a catalyst, causing others around it to fall in love without falling in love itself. I rather think Almqvist uses the drama format so much because it allows the characters to assign a gender to Tintomara, but frees the author from committing himself.

I first read this in the original Swedish some 35 years ago, and it was rather hard going in another language--Almqvist's allusive and circumlocutory style is even more confusing than the randomness already described. Indeed, I was quite surprised to find out how much it turns out I had read correctly and still remembered accurately, my recollection of it seeming so unlikely.

I don't know of any 19th-century treatment of gender ambiguity that begins to compare, especially in terms of sexual tension. A little hard to give a single rating to: the uniqueness and the lasting impression it made argue for greatness; the dated and inconvenient style and language make it more "interesting" than "fascinating." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOZ4WA49A2K7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1900850427&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Caleb Hanson]

*Leg Over Leg: Volume One* (2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
“And here she interrupts him, saying, ‘I take your meaning, which is self-evident and calls for no explanation, and is just what I was going to say myself. So give me your hand and take mine’—and so it continues until their hands have roamed all over, groping and grasping, swiping and wiping, searching and seeking, poking and stroking, squeezing and teasing, clasping and parting, slapping and tickling, rooting and rummaging, delving and digging, rubbing and pinching.” This passage, translated from the hundred-fifty-year-old Arabic book Leg Over Leg shows the book at its best: playful; linguistically limber; language, sex, and love balled into one jumble. With the publication of Humphrey Davies’ translation of Volume III and IV of Aḥmad Fāris al-Shidyāq’s novel, the introduction of this Lebanese classic of Arabic literature into English comes to a close, and opens the doors of discussion, interpretation, and a chance for more Arabic literature in translation to find the attention this work has received. Written in 1855, in a language that is severely under-translated, and largely autobiographical, there’s the temptation to turn to the historical record to contextualize the book, to focus on it as a piece of history. That this translation is a chance for English-language readers to have a greater understanding of al-Shidyāq’s place in the history of Arabic literature is undeniable. He’s an author who blended Western traditions and culture into Arabic while practicing traditional Arabic forms and mining the depths of obscure and unimaginably specific Arabic words. However, to focus too much on the historical, the timeline of literature, risks reducing Leg Over Leg to mere artifact, dead facts instead of living literature. It can deny the life, the entertainment, of the book, and cut off interpretations and reactions that come from reading it now, responding to the text as a contemporary reader. Reading Leg Over Leg somewhere between historical blindness and overt attachment to autobiographical and historical readings deepens its well of interpretation, as understood by the author himself, who writes, “A book . . . grows more valuable with each passing year, and its benefits multiply.”

The benefits of Leg Over Leg have multiplied, and its contemporaneity is astonishing. It is a bawdy celebration of sexuality, satirical of religion, narrated by an author aware of and commenting on the act of writing and reading, proto-feminist, and more. This shock, that a book from its time, from its area of the world, could be so involved with the complications of a protagonist who both is and isn’t the author, that the narrator is self-aware, that the equal rights and intelligence of women is promoted, also risks overwhelming the book: when trying to convince friends it’s worth reading, I found the easiest arguments tempting, that it’s progressive in many of its values, especially for 1850s Lebanon, and it’s wildly transgressive in spending six full pages listing words for different types of vaginas, penises, and sex. This reduces, and undersells. In ways, in the arguments between husband and wife that make up much of Volume IV, Leg Over Leg is progressive and transgressive for 2010s America through their honest, open expression, reaching for solid ground to stand on together, even if the perspectives themselves are familiar:

“Is there a single man who can maintain an affection and not deviate from it every day. I swear, were women to desire men as much as men desire women, you wouldn’t find a single man unbewitched.”

“Is there a single woman who can maintain affection and not deviate from it each day a thousand times?” I asked her. “All books bear witness to the trustworthiness of men and the treachery of women.” “Weren’t the ones who wrote those books men?” she countered. “They’re the ones who made up those stories.” “But only after investigation and experience.”

It beats out most contemporary novels in the formal risks it takes, as when the narrator interrupts to challenge the reader to keep up, or ends a chapter by admitting that both author and reader need to take a break, relax a while. In a three-sentence chapter titled “Nothing,” the narrator declares that he must “sit myself down a while in the shade of this short chapter to brush off the dust of my labors.” The shock of a novel such as this coming from when and where it does also, oddly, denies the historical, forgets that the basic, confined structure of the novel is actually, as shown at length in Steven Moore’s The Novel: An Alternative History, a modern development. “The novel has always been a workshop, not a museum,” Moore writes. A reader’s surprise at the “newness” of Leg Over Leg is an immediate, surface-level gut reaction, and to go no further is a denial of the historical, much as the historical is itself a denial of what is new.

At its core, Leg Over Leg is a travelogue. The protagonist is the Fariyāq—the name a portmanteau of Fāris al-Shidyāq—who moves from Lebanon, to Malta, to England, to Paris, and makes various stops along points in between. Along the way he makes friends and enemies, joins and leaves a monastery or two, works varied jobs as translator, dream interpreter, general scholar, marries, and has a family. And the book itself travels, has its own sense of motion. Though there is a sexual innuendo in the title Leg Over Leg—legs entwined, either in action or in the post-coital jumble of comfort—it also calls to mind a sashaying one foot in front of the other, traveling confidently, with style, across themes, obsessions, affections. Arguments over religion take hold in the first two volumes, then, like traveling from one land to another, crossing border regions, in volumes III and IV, family matters take over. Like an intelligent, careful traveler, the progress is gradual, never rushed, and lands far in the distance must be remembered or anticipated in order to be understood: the Fariyāq’s love of women is present in all four volumes, but begins to shift when he meets his wife, and then changes further when she turns out to be able to go toe-to-toe with him intellectually and conversationally.

The traveling pace is such that I became habituated to the physical act of reading. Published with the Arabic on the verso page, I turned pages quickly, glancing to my left only occasionally, journeying through the facing page of English. Later, reading some other book, when excited, or alternatively, when bored, I caught myself skipping that verso page, my hands wanting to be back in Leg Over Leg. Even if it changed the pace of the journey, it would be wonderful to see a single, English-only paperback containing all four volumes with minimized footnotes, opening Leg Over Leg to readers who aren't able to spend $40 on each individual hardbound volume.

The translation too wanders and weaves the best path through difficult landscapes and cities made of a mesh of crisscrossing streets. In Davies’ afterword, he explains the ways that his approach shifted as he went, finding new ways to handle the exhaustive lists that fuel al-Shidyāq’s delves into Arabic linguistic resources. The differing approaches are apparent in the English, which in other works could be off-putting, and read as an error, but fitting to the exploration of language, culture, and life that is Leg Over Leg. In a book filled with puns, rhyming, obscure wordplay, words with the same Arabic root being slipped in one for the other, for a translation to capture the suggestion of a pun even if the full pun itself is impossible is a new creative act.

Based on the complications of the language alone, one could excuse a translator for being too intimidated to take on the task. Added to that is the posturing of al-Shidyāq himself. Not only does he set up his fictional counterpart for competitive rivalries with translators, slagging them as harshly as he can, Volume IV contains a detailed, lengthy, and irritated collection of errors by translators from Arabic. We’re fortunate that Davies took al-Shidyāq’s insults as a challenge and rose to it. His perpetually inventive work made Leg Over Leg a worthy finalist for the Best Translated Book Award. As an overall award, honoring some combination of the author’s efforts and the translator’s efforts, Seiobo There Below was deserving to the upmost, but were it solely a translation award, this massive and successful undertaking, pushing to the boundaries of translation, Leg Over Leg would have, if you’ll forgive the pun, the leg up.

More than that, al-Shidyāq is out to challenge his readers as well, early on starting a chapter with a purposeful warning and challenge: “I must go on at some length in this chapter, just to test the reader’s endurance. If he gets to the end of it without his teeth smoking with rage, his knees knocking together from frustration and fury, the place between his eyes knitting together in disgust and shame, or his jugulars swelling in wrath and ire . . .” So with that warning, that combining of the intellectual into the physical, one can be put off, why read an author who is so intent on being difficult that he feels it necessary to tell you so? Because the play is in the warning itself. The little  underlying giddiness is itself intriguing, sly in a way that puts al-Shidyāq on your side, and he finishes off that “if” clause with “I shall devote a separate chapter to his praise and count him among those readers who are ‘steadfast.’” Regardless of where we find the reward, we’re promised one, and it’s there even in the moment of warning. If the warning itself is a pleasure, then Leg Over Leg won’t really be that difficult—and that’s the exact game that al-Shidyāq is playing.

From the earliest pages, al-Shidyāq is out to celebrate the Arabic language, to demonstrate its breadth of expression, his knowledge, and his skills in deploying that knowledge. The most direct way this is expressed is through lists, which come in two basic forms. There are lists in the running text that are a sign of the narrator getting carried away with his passion and prowess, as when he turns his attention to the beauty of Englishwomen and their movements, “You see them turning disdainfully to one side, shying, flying, starting, bolting, flinching, fleeing, proudly turning, racing, baulking, jibbing, bounding, leaping . . .” These lists give the prose its sense of being carried on a river of language, flowing momentum, each jump from one to the other a virtuoso performance. Some of these lists come in only a few words; others run for a page or more. It is in these that Davies notes he relied on the dictionaries and thesauri for the translation, which would seem to diminish his own input, but for each passage to maintain that propulsion, and for the associations between words to be wide but clear, for sounds of one word to play off the sounds of those ahead and behind, demands creativity and care.

The other lists are quotations from the Arabic dictionary the Qāmūs. These can last for up to a dozen pages and are presented in two columns, with the transliteration of the Arabic on the left side of the page, and the direct translation of the definition on the right. This is when al-Shidyāq puts aside his literary skills and wants to overpower the reader with the possibilities of language, listing near synonym after near synonym, or absurdly specific words, such as one for “a white stone like marble” and one for “a white stone softer than marble.” When a potential reader hears that at one point, back-to-back groupings of such lists surpasses twenty pages, it’s reasonable to fear a dry text, to think again of a historical relic, or to look forward to skipping such pages, but to do either would be a mistake.

For within each list, there are nuggets of joy for the lover of language, the satisfaction of knowing that a such specific words exist, or existed, in the world, or the pleasure of finding words to conjure up ideas not previously imagined, such as “a beast that can carry an elephant on its horn.” The moments of discovery will vary from reader to reader, and for the truly ambitious, from reading to reading. More than these little uncoverings, the lists are an essential part of the pacing the novel, and al-Shidyāq is conscious of this. Setting up one of the longest series of lists, he creates a scenario of a man not fully listening to his wife, instead thinking of “buying a donkey to ride,” then moves through lists of gems and metals, jewelry and ornaments, perfumes, and various household objects. When he concludes the lists, he jumps on our own drifting thoughts, telling us all that has been accomplished by amassing these objects, while “you’re still worrying about the ass.” In earlier references, the animal was always a donkey. It’s not hard to think that the change, the suggestion of the insult to us for still thinking about it, is intentional.

Leg Over Leg enacts, too, the occasional monotony of travel, but even such monotony serves a clear purpose. Only in such bouts of boredom could you suddenly stumble over something new, something that, if it were placed close to jokes and arguments would be totally missed. But there, in the boredom, you are able to see it freshly, see it at an angle of thought you’d never come from otherwise. It’s like walking aimlessly in a place you know well, and suddenly seeing a building or a wood from a direction you’ve never approached, and it’s seen anew.

The thin border, repeatedly transgressed, between the author al-Shidyāq and his mirror protagonist the Fariyāq is another way that Leg Over Leg opens up, creates space for the reader to roam and romp. Al-Shidyāq moves back and forth between the world that the Fariyāq lives in, and the world that al-Shidyāq controls. The line between the two is thin, and it’s up to us to fully remove it, creating a break between the Fariyāq and al-Shidyāq, or to leave it in place. When al-Shidyāq writes tells us after an interruption that the Fariyāq continues speaking, but yet he, the narrator, not the Fariyāq was the one interrupted, do we see that as a mistake, or purposeful confusion? Though he never lets us forget their overlaps, the narrator always happy to separate the two, as when the Fariyāq composes a less than stellar poem, and al-Shidyāq ends the chapter by admitting this and noting, “It is not my way, however, to pull the wool over the eyes of the reader, with whom I share an old friendship going back to the beginning of this work. Let him, therefore, take note of that fact.” But this separation is immediately followed by the most heartbreaking chapter, where the two fall together completely. After the death of the Fariyāq’s son, there’s a chapter-long poem elegy for him, and in there, the speaking “I” is an inseparable Fariyāq and al-Shidyāq.

The slippage of the narration occurs with other characters as well. Both al-Shidyāq and the Fariyāq take up rhyming, speaking or writing with rhymed pairs throughout a passage, sometimes the words just rhyming, other times paired as antonyms, or two words that now interact with each other, in a way that specific words sentences apart wouldn’t normally interplay. The Fariyāq and al-Shidyāq both do this when they become passionate about a subject, whether with affection or anger, and al-Shidyāq sometimes finds himself doing so without meaning to (so he says), so that when other characters take it up, it’s as if he, and not them, is worked up, and forgotten that he’s meant to be writing in their voice, not his. It’s another trick in his arsenal that lets him play as if he’s not in masterful control, as if language is such a powerful force that even a master like him is barely able to rein it in.

One of the most meaningful movements of characters and narrators opens Chapter 7 of Volume IV. By this point, the Fariyāq and his wife, the Fariyāqiyyah, have been arguing on and off for most of the volume—the arguments of a couple fiercely in love, both intelligent, both capable of honesty and defensiveness that borders on self-deception. Earlier on, the Fariyāqiyyah was introduced as essentially a pretty woman in a window who the Fariyāq falls for and marries, impressing her other admirers for “winning” such a woman. Instead, she reveals herself to be independent, opinionated, intelligent, and vocal, and increasingly so as the book moves on. By Chapter 7, she’s shown her ability to challenge the Fariyāq; consequently, the chapter's departure from his perspective—instead agreeing completely with the Fariyāqiyyah— means that their voices are given such equal weight that the reader must decide who to agree with, if picking sides is even necessary.

This work begins with a respect for women unexpected for its time, and so Volume IV is in ways more progressive and honest than anything we see today. Much of the time, expressions of feminism are necessarily monologues, and all too often when they are dialogues, they are between people who so vehemently disagree that few new thoughts are birthed, or are so moderated that both sides hold back from emotions, from the self with irrational beliefs, from personal experience, from mistakes. But here we have a man and a woman vehemently arguing with each other about the flaws and values of men and women, how they should act, why they act the way they do, and each one makes clear, thoughtful points, each loses track of themselves, defending or excusing, and becomes emotional and defensive, even insulting. Then, later, outside of the argument in thought or action, each of them proves wrong many of stereotypical flaws. Throughout, in argument and in narration, the harshest judgments of moral failure stereotyped to each gender are spread equally. Holding together all their agreements and mistakes is their underlying passion for each other: “‘My, my!’ she said, what’s this? Could it be that you’ve brought me to this country to recast me and fashion me into another woman?’ ‘I’d rather die!’ I said.”

Their arguments are also the culmination of the connection between expression through language and sexuality. Early on, pens are erupting with excitement, spilling ink, and among other things we learn that there is an Arabic word that means both food and sex, bringing two different pleasures into language play, and al-Shidyāq creates more overlap, as at a dinner party “how many a flank is pressed against flank, how many a milk skin gushes.” Neither husband nor wife forget their sexuality and mutual attraction during the arguments, in fact the Fariyāqiyyah repeatedly “misinterprets” something the Fariyāq says into a sexual pun, both expressing her own sexuality, and throwing him off the point of his argument. In one of the most enjoyable passages, their argument becomes a rapid fire exchange of rhymes and innuendo that ends with “‘In joking’ — ‘And poking’ and that concluded their merrymaking.” In a climax in more ways than one, the masturbatory becomes copulation.

As in so many reviews, this is an attempt to capture bits of what makes a bold, expansive, creative, and exploratory work of mastery all of those things, and with that, focused on what seems important, serious, but it would be doing Leg Over Leg a massive disservice to not make it clear how funny it is. This is a book that for all its challenges, all its insight into humanity, all its place in history, had me regularly laughing out loud. No sex joke is beneath al-Shidyāq, no fart joke, nothing that encourages you to explode with laughter is beneath him, neither are subtle jokes out of his reach. Deep into the book, the Fariyāq takes to task those people who, when they start learning a foreign language, immediately want to know the dirtiest words. He mocks them for their pettiness . . . yet this is a book that again, in the earliest pages, listed, seemingly endlessly, detailed descriptions of different types of vaginas and penises. When contradictions occur, it’s up to you figure out what you believe, what you hold to. This too is a sign of the importance of vast linguistic expression to al-Shidyāq: “She said ‘That in seriousness is humor and in humor seriousness.’” Humor and seriousness overlap, expression and morality overlap, and it all reaches out, demanding participation from the reader. Leg Over Leg is a sprawling work that asks the reader to be able to see the sprawl as well as the master who created it all. - http://www.musicandliterature.org/reviews/2014/6/16/ahmad-faris-al-shidyaqs-leg-over-leg[P.

*****
The Life and Opinions of John Buncle, Esquire by Thomas Amory is a rare find throughout the canon of English literature. Long discarded as a secondary read, one that only conneussers and bibliophiles have access to it must somehow receive an injection of interest, for its reading is not only entertaining but informative and psychologically engaging. Hazlitt compared it to Francois Rabelais' "Gargantua and Pantagruel"; while a more temperate Charles Lamb called it "an extraordinary compound of all manners of subjects, from the depth of the ludicrous to the heights of religious truths...an infinite fund of pleasantry."

The gravity, the unconscious humor of the protagonist, the tender affectations, the inimitable stentorian quality here forwarded, and to the delights of many the hard-hearted furious vices of John Buncle denote a blushing irrational suit and vainglorious sensuality that emphatically parlays with the audience's disposition for the inadmissibly excessive, a forefather to Ignatius Reilly of the Confederacy of Dunces, but in a more pronounced articulate and British whimsy that fuses the line between wit and fancy, righteousness and stubborn characterizations. The frivolous and the mad are sentimental enough to warrant our sympathy whereas an overweening presence to faith describes the fears of emptiness with dulcet candor through a unique neurosis, as graceful as much as it is crass.

Finally I shall end by echoing the words of Leigh Hunt who in his essay "A Book for a Corner , entices one to read the book and roam about in its leisurely and discursive pages, where John Buncle's love for good living is met with a pharisaic animus against vice, blind egotism and portentous arrogance, namely a caricature of some of our (Englishmen) national qualities. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LMFMBV7GRJGS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1162669160&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Luca Graziuso and Marina Ross]

*****
If you only read one book in the next few months, try to make Recreations your choice.

An English translation of Yuri Andrukhovych's first novel, Recreations (first published in Ukrainian 1992) is a riveting look at a night in the life of a group of hard drinking poets attending a festival.

Andrukhovych is not very well known yet in North America. The only other literary work of his that has appeared in translation so far was a short story in "From Three Worlds; New Writing From Ukraine" (also available from Amazon.com) reviewed in Zdorov! magazine (Winter 1998). The writer is bound to become better known in the future (he appeared at the 19th Annual International Festival of Authors in Toronto and was interviewed in a Bravo! special aired in the spring of 1999).

The book's narrative opens in 1991 just prior to Ukraine's independence. Khomsky (Khoma), a poet, is returning to Ukraine from Leningrad to attend a revival of the long forgotten "Festival of the Resurrecting Spirit". Held in the mythical Chortopil, the novel describes the festival as commemorating a time when "Emancipated souls celebrated their renewal, Free Laughter and Untrammelled Poetry ascended to waft over the sinful earth, and the Dastardly Skeletal One retreated before the implacable blows of Human immorality."

The festival, "an orgy of popular culture, civic dysfunction, national pride, and sex," becomes a backdrop on which Andrukhovych examines the interactions of four poets, Khoma, Yurko Nemyrych, Hryts Shtundera, and Rostyslav Martofliak who contend with the cultural baggage of being Ukrainian. The festival is run by one Matsapura, (the name alludes to the scoundrel Pavlo Matsapura, a character in Ivan Kotliarevsky's Eneida).

Matsapura creates a "total festival" where even the German snake oil salesman hawking his goods in the town square is just an actor playing a role. Everything is geared to give the festival goers an experience they will never forget. Yet Matsapura, like the rest of the characters, is testing the waters of the new freedom that people are experiencing in Ukraine. How far can one go before it is too far? In the end, Matsapura goes just far enough.

Without giving too much away, things become more and more bizarre as the festival's first evening progresses. From Nemyrych's and Shtundera's first encounter with the demonic Dr. Popel ("I am not young and I am not old boys. I am eternal"), to the climactic end, the characters stumble (quite literally) from one experience to another. Although the main characters are a bunch of booze-soaked egomaniacs, the reader develops a sympathy for them.

Andrukhovych is a master at making the reader a part of his tale. As each character stumbles into increasingly surreal surroundings, the reader is transported into the scenes with them. Nemyrych and Shtundera, each in his own way, discovers a part of the past in this little village of Chortopil. It is a past that is dark, even frightening. Martofliak grapples with alcoholism and Khoma with personal loyalty.

Unlike many authors who don't seem to know how to write a good ending, Andrukhovych builds the tension in crafty increments, sustaining the readers' interest right to the end and then wallops you with a crescendo that frankly caught me completely off guard. Andrukhovych leaves you wanting more, which is just as it should be. Let's hope his other novels, Moscoviad: A Horror Novel (1993) and Perversions (1996) are translated into English as soon as possible.

Andrukhovych, born in Ivano-Frankivsk in 1960, is considered to be one of the leaders of a new generation of Ukrainian authors. With Oleksander Irvanets and Viktor Neborak, Andrukhovych is a founding member of Bu-Ba-Bu a group of poets/writers "specializing in literary happenings, scandals and provocations." Bu-Ba-Bu stands for "burlesk" (burlesque) "balahan" (farce) and "bufonada" (buffonery). The members of Bu-Ba-Bu have been stretching the boundaries of Ukrainian creativity since its founding in 1985. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RZEDIE129N6NT/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1895571243&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[yuriy diakunchak]

*****
"THE FIRST translation of Alf Layla wa-Layla, or The Thousand and One Nights, into a European language (French) in the early 1700s started a genre that has flowed and ebbed ever since, bringing forth imitations, hoaxes, and more translations. One of the more obscure, and impressive, is The Adventures of Hatim Tai, translated into English (from an eighteenth-century Persian manuscript) by Duncan Forbes and published in 1830 by the Oriental Translation Fund.

This work's continued obscurity in the West can be inferred from the scant attention it receives in Robert Irwin's masterful study, The Arabian Nights (1994). Yet in India it has inspired films and popular television series. Hatim Tai, based on an historic, pre-Islamic Arab poet, is an odd hero: ecumenical, brave, shrewd, saintly, sensual, polygamous, chivalrous even to animals. Power in his world comes from fairies and demons, talismans and spells.

Compared to The Thousand and One Nights, the present work is shorter and more unified—quite possibly the work of a single author—and much more fantastic. Rather than nesting stories, it connects them tangentially. On his way to complete a quest for distressed character A, he encounters B and sets off on another quest, only to meet C and set off tangentially again, and again. The tasks are Herculean, but Hatim Tai's virtue is strong and his magic potent. The pacing is brisk, the details weird (bleeding rocks, a desert of solid brass, a tree of human heads). The story lines eventually unwind in reverse order, and all petitioners are satisfied—including the reader with a taste for adventure." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2016/cur1609.htm[Robert  Eldridge]

*The Hundred Brothers* (2011)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Brothers-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/031266219X/[Amazon]

*****
Doug, the protagonist of this wickedly delicious novel, is gathering with 98 of his brothers in the giant library of their family mansion for a night of food, drink, and hedonistic revelry. The entire book (albeit short at a mere 188 pages) takes place during the course of this night. How does someone have 99 siblings to begin with, where is anyone else in the family, and why this night of all night do they meet? Well, it's never quite explained. We do meet all hundred brothers though, and Antrim even lists everyone of them in one very long first sentence. After that things quickly jump the tracks of any normally structured novel and descend into somewhat of a mad scene that goes on and on.

After a few pages we find out at least what the narrator's hope is for the night: that they finally find out what happened to their dead father's urn and put his memory to rest. But as fights break out, alcohol and drugs are consumed, bats get in, the windows are opened, a storm approaches, and old rivalries are re-explored, bedlam breaks out and we find that each brother has a more sinister goal, with the narrator Doug at the middle of their designs.

There are definitely more questions raised than answered, and much is unclear, which makes this little book a joy of speculation. What do the hundred brothers symbolize? Why is one missing? Why is a mother never mentioned? If the house is falling apart, what's to become of everyone?

A lot of fun to read with laugh-out-loud an hour after your bedtime moments (because you just can't put it down), this imaginative work is something like the Underground Man getting drunk and gaying it up at a huge party. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RJY74BX3CW6SO/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031266219X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[ACD]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Elect-Mr-Robinson-Better-World/dp/0312662106/[Amazon]

*****
This is one of those books that keeps doing its work long after the last word has been read. Antrim makes his art like he observes his life: contradictions galore. Mr. Robinson's loyalty to his wife and to his ideals regarding education don't seem as if they should fit within the general paranoid isolative nature of his community, and yet they do, in a very real way. Mr. Robinson attempts to make a real difference in his community while neighbors build vastly deep moats equipped with lethal spikes to surround their homes. There is a haunting similarity to the entire town's psyche here in this image, and Mr. Robinson is not immune to this. Characters seem to proceed with a wide knowledge of life and its intricacies, yet are unable to make the connections between things: to see how interest can breed obsession, how love can inspire violence. There exists the danger of falling through these cracks and understanding and this is indeed what happens.

The novel creeps toward an unsettling climax that you always know in the back of your mind is coming, yet can't quite let yourself believe it to be true. The cliched neighbor response to the latest small town horror on the six o'clock news comes to mind. "He seemed like a nice man. The perfect neighbor. Basically kept to himself." "Elect Mr. Robinson For A Better World" is touching and unsettling in the way that little art is and most life can be. Despite jacketflap trumpeting, few novelists seem willing to be brave enough to address the pockets of darkness that exist in the well-lit homes of the upper middle class. Don't expect the feel good book of the year, but if you're looking for something thought-provoking, this might very well be what you need to read. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IBMS6YW8HUS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312662106&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Robert S.

*****
Louis Aragon (1897-1982) published the most enchanting of all surrealist novels, translated as "Paris Peasant," in 1924. Two years earlier, on the cusp between DADAism and surrealism he had inverted (and perverted) the 17th-century didactic book of the same title by Fenelon. Both authors imagined Telemachus, son of crafty Ulysses and patient (and far-from-guileless) Penelope, setting out to find out why his father has not returned to Greece with the other victors of the Trojan War.

Telemachus and his ancient Mentor (the goddess of wisdom, Minerva in gender-crossing disguise) wash up on the shores of Ogygia, where his father had earlier dallied with Calypso and her nymphs. The family resemblance is instantly noticed, and Calypso wants to take up with the younger image of the lover who abandoned her. He is also lusted after by the nymph Eucharis.

I am making it sound as if there was a plot, but the book is almost entirely digressions that are not senseless, but are mostly pointless, as Aragon played with words and the strange juxtapositions DADAists conjured and adored. I would estimate that the text is less than 20,000 words. Perhaps it is delightful in French, though I doubt it. It was certainly a provocation, including a lesbian tryst and the debauching a virtuous youth (the inversion of Fenelon). In the formulation of the helpful (trés academic) introduction by the brave translators), Aragon (et al.) "freed himself from the constraints of mimeticism in regard to fable, meaning, and language, ... dissociated language from significance... [and] generated a verbal overflow or overkill, kindling the desire for and the voluptuousness of verbal indulgence"... which is not everyone's glass of absinthe. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17TYGTT3BEHL6/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1878972235[Stephen O.

*****
John Arbuthnot (1667-1735) was physician to Britain's Queen Anne. He was also a talented satirist and humorist, but neither sought to preserve or take credit for his own works. He is considered to be the principle author, in collaboration with his friends Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, of Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus. The authors were members of a group which called itself the "Scriblerians."

The authors' intent was to write an English novel comparable to Cervantes's Don Quixote. Unfortunately, it remained unfinished and somewhat roughly formed, but what there is of Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus is quite remarkable. It might have been the landmark novel that Laurence Sterne's Tristam Shandy was to be later in the century, and there are so many aspects and incidents in common between the two that it's quite likely Sterne was influenced by the Scriblerians.

The story begins with Cornelius Scriblerus, the father-to-be of Martinus. Cornelius is a scholar so obsessed with the writings of the ancient Greeks that he lives his life only by their beliefs and precepts (just as Don Quixote modeled his life on the romances of Chivalry). His goal in life is to beget and raise a son entirely on Greek principles and methods. He selects for his wife a maiden with the proper characteristics and pedigree, but their union remains childless for ten years despite "a constant and frequent compliance to the chief duty of conjugal life." Fortunately he finds a prescription for infertility in the writings of Galen and for a year feeds his poor wife nothing but goat's milk and honey. Furthermore, following Aristotle's advice, he "with-held the nuptial embrace when the wind was in any point of the South" to ensure that the sex of the child would be male. The couple is finally rewarded with the birth of young Martinus.

Martinus is raised, of course, strictly in accordance with the Ancients. He can have no food, no playthings, and no form of medical care that wasn't written down by the Greeks. For the reader this means a series of lively and often hilarious domestic and scholarly disputes. But the authors often venture aside to satirize writings and political issues of their time. At other times the writing is pure whimsy, such as this series of puns on the suffix "led":

"Our Noblemen and Drunkards are pimp-led, Physicians and Pulses fee-led, their Patients and Oranges pil-led, a New-married Man and an Ass are bride-led, and old-married Man and a Pack-horse sad-led, Cats and Dice are rat-led, Swine and Nobility are sty-led..."

There is only one complete chapter telling of Martinus's adult life, and it describes his bizarre marriage. Attending a display of curiosities--what we would call a freak show--he is entranced by a pair of conjoined twins. Two beautiful young women, each complete but for one detail, are joined such that they share a single "organ of generation." Lindamira and Indamora are their names. Martinus falls in love with Lindamira; later he steals her away from the show and secretly marries her. But Indamora is an unwilling partner to this, which lands Martinus in a court of law accused of both incest and rape. His defense is to claim that Lindamira and Indamora are but a single person because his previous scientific researches have proven that the seat of the human soul is in the genitals, and having only one such organ between the two of them, the sisters have only one soul.

The book concludes with a numbered list of Martins Scriblerus's other deeds and accomplishments, many of which were presumably intended to have been expanded into full chapters. Among other things, Martinus devised "a Computation of the Duration of the Sun, and how long it will last before it be burn'd out." He also calculated "how much the Inhabitants of the Moon eat for Supper, considering that they pass a night equal to fifteen of our natural days," and went on to draft a treaty by which the European powers would divide up the moon and its inhabitants once conquered.

We are also promised the story of Martinus's journeys around the globe in an attempt to experience every form of natural disaster, of which the earthquake was the only one he failed to observe. There is also mention of a series of voyages in which he discovers, first, "the Remains of the ancient Pygmaean Empire." Then he is "happily shipwreck'd on the Land of the Giants," and on his third voyage discovers a "whole Kingdom of Philosophers." These, of course, are what we now know as Gulliver's Travels. It was originally intended to be co-written by the Scriblerians with Martinus Scriblerus as the hero. But after their separation, Jonathan Swift wrote it on its own and made the traveler, Lemuel Gulliver, a physician modeled after Dr. Arbuthnot.

For its historical value alone Memoirs of the Extraordinary Life, Works, and Discoveries of Martinus Scriblerus would be worth reading, but it is also a very entertaining work on its own merits. It's a shame that it was never completed. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMIJL9GXKVUS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1843910012&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Steven Davis]

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000191/[Amazon]

*****
In the brilliant tradition of Don Quixote and Candide, Hallucinations is a modern masterpiece of Latin American fiction. Fray Servando-priest, blasphemer, dueler of monsters, irresistible lover, misunderstood prophet, prisoner, and consummate escape artist-wanders among the vice-ridden populations of eighteenth-century Europe and the Americas, fleeing dungeons, a marriage-minded female, a slaveship captain, and the Inquisition. Whether by burro, by boat, or by the back of a whale, Fray Servando's journey is at once funny and romantic, melancholy and profound-a tale rooted in history, yet outrageously hallucinatory. - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000191/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
If you want to read a work that is literally pornography, you are in luck. Remember, pornography literally, etymologically, is "whore writing", or writing about or by prostitutes. Of course we have grown away from this literal standard, but _The School of Whoredom_ (Hesperus Press) by Pietro Aretino meets it. It consists of a classic dialogue (from the time when dialogues where the choice way of explaining ideas in astronomy and philosophy) between a whore and her daughter who will become a whore. This makes it sound quite a bit coarser than it really is. While the book is not without frankness and the translator has not spared four-letter words, it is a sophisticated satire on the morals of men and women. It is full of jokes, robust humor at the expense of courtiers, clerics, men, women, and different ethnicities of the sixteenth century. It has some advice to a daughter that works just fine in modern and less meretricious settings.

_The School of Whoredom_ (written around 1535) is not a work like Aretino's famous _I Modi_, called the world's first "stroke book". While it treats of the erotic endeavors of men and women, it could hardly be called an erotic work itself. Basically, it is instruction more on how to be a courtesan than how effectively to engage in coitus. As such, it is more about manipulation of the emotions of men than of their anatomy, and might be read as a prescient call to feminist solidarity. Whoring, mother Nanna reminds daughter Pippa, isn't easy: "So, you see, becoming a whore is no career for fools, well I know it..." She also advises, "You'd need more skills than a doctor to be a courtesan." There is plenty of other advice, some proverbial. "Never mock at the truth and never do harm with a joke." "Don't take pleasure in upsetting friendships by reporting gossip; avoid scandals; and whenever you can make peace do so." By such means, Pippa is to ensure her position of relative esteem in society, but always she is to be mindful of the bottom line: "... a courtesan whose heart pounds for anything other than her purse is like a greedy, drunken tavern-keeper..." who eats his own fare instead of selling it.
While the liveliest parts of the book are the descriptions of ruses for parting punters from their extra cash, there are many pictures here of a vibrant society, one which valued good food and entertainment. Aretino's work shows they also liked satire. There is much here to expose those in power, and plenty that makes fun of the sexual peccadilloes from cardinals to monks and nuns. Nanna discusses the merits (or lack thereof) between Frenchmen, Spaniards, Romans, Florentines, and Germans, giving pride of place to the Venetians ("If I said everything they deserve to have said about them, people would tell me: 'Love has blinded you.'"). Nanna has triumphed over men for years, and is delighted with Pippa's prospects: "My heart swells so much with pride at seeing you at home in these affairs that I'm in raptures." Careful reading, though, almost five centuries later, shows she has instructed about far more than the ways of whoredom. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R17OJDBRGBQPRV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1843910365&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Rob Hardy]

*****
This book is a great read. It is basically a catalogue of all the nasty tricks the author could think of men and women playing on one another -- a Renaissance battle of the sexes, told with great brio and style. It is deeply cynical and unrestrainedly profane, so anyone looking for tales of snow-white unicorns jumping over rainbows in dewy meadows should skip this title. Best to read it as a testament to its author's wit rather than as a historical document on morals and manners, though it certainly is a historical document and can be read that way. I had to put it down several times as I laughed so hard tears streamed from my eyes.

You have to keep reminding yourself as you read this book that it was written by a man. The characters are all female and Aretino must have had great fun attacking his own gender through them. One senses a genuinely female intuition and outrage... Aretino's intimate knowledge of sexual attitudes and politics would have made him a fascinating companion both in and outside the bedroom.

The book is in 3 parts... part 1 has Nanna the whore telling her friend Antonia about her adventures as a nun, a wife and a whore. At the end of part 1 they decide that Nanna's young daughter Pippa should choose whoredom over nunnery and wifery. Logically, in part 2 Nanna tells Pippa how to be a whore. In part 3 a procuress (bawd) tells both Nanna and Pippa about the trials and triumphs of bawdry.

If you are in a hurry you can skim or even skip part 1 -- it is the least interesting of the three parts and the rest of the book doesn't depend on it. Part 2 is absolutely brilliant, and part 3 is quite good also. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GRHMUKKFY4N2/[aproductofsociety]

*****
This keenly observed account of humans in and out of lust (and, occasionally, love) is timeless and wonderful. Through the storytelling by courtesans and procuresses one watches Aretino weave a tapestry of human scheming and gender battles that is as fresh today as it was nearly 500 years ago when it was penned. It is amazing to reflect as one reads this book, which is entirely and quite convincingly narrated by women, that it was written by a man. Aretino had a penetrating (no pun intended) and deeply humane insight that glows through these witty pages. It is said that he influenced de Sade and one can detect that influence in the works of the much more famous rake who lived over 200 years later. In brilliance and originality, however, Aretino eclipses de Sade who was fixated on shock value.

On a practical note, I recommend skimming part one since it is a tad weak and then reading parts two and three entirely. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YHS19SM2U0JU/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941419967&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[aproductofsociety]

*****
Determined to solve a dual crime-on the one hand an abstract Millennial Conspiracy perpetrated against the conventional "logocentric" mind, on the other a gruesome murder-litterateur-detective August Saint embarks on a most peculiar investigation, one that requires him to unravel the collusion of a dazzling assortment of unlikely characters. In his investigation Saint wanders through a distinctly familiar European landscape, but simultaneously, inexplicably, finds himself traversing parallel media-spawned realities. He discovers that movies, comic strips, news articles, biographies, and fiction have each captured a channel on some formerly unimaginable, universal, television-like network. There characters and incidents, while indulging in spatio-temporal experimentation and dodging astrogel intervention from outer space, evolve infinitely and cross media with impunity. In this reconfigured universe Saint mingles with celebrities from movies, television, and literature; courts a beautiful Cuban maiden; and witnesses the twentieth century's most magnificent and horrific events. His discovery, after these endless and exhausting adventures? The conspirators in the crime are legion. They include a Belgian comic book hero, and agile "bi-locating" friar, an aristocratic Proustian masochist, a sinister clerical familiar, an NYPD chief of Detectives, a distinguished Italian film director, the Baader-Meinhof gang, assorted literary luminaries, and possibly even Dr. Spock. At last, the criminal is captured and brought to trial, and in his features Saint recognizes a very familiar face.In The Mind Crime of August Saint, Alain Arias-Misson mines the epistemological fault-line where the old world of the written word lies uneasily against twenty-first-century electronic media culture. His latest novel is a fascinating fictive experience of a culture in the process of transformation. - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0932511791/qid=1064551105/[Amazon boilerplate]

[[The_Seven_Madmen]]
*The Seven Madmen* (1998)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/185242592X/[Amazon]

*****
This book was published in 1929. This English translation, by Nick Caistor, was published in 1998. An earlier translation by Naomi Lindstrom came out in 1984.

The author, Roberto Arlt (1900-42), has been called one of the first Latin American novelists to break away from conventional realism toward more inward-looking writing, reflecting Dostoevsky and his own experience. His fiction focused on low-life characters and lost souls in the poorer neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. His work was far removed from the refined, intricate, otherworldly short stories of Borges, and his half-crazed characters likewise bore little resemblance to those of Borges. Though the writing of both was filled with pessimism and a sense of human absurdity.

Arlt considered The Seven Madmen to be the most important of his four novels, but during his brief life he appears to have been better known for his journalism and his plays. An afterword by the translator mentioned his influence on later writers like Onetti and Cortázar and increasing critical appreciation since the 1960s.

The characters in this novel -- anguished, guilt-ridden or deranged -- were unsympathetic. The madmen of the title were seven major/peripheral characters who more or less joined forces by the end of the novel. They sought success in pathetic schemes like founding a new religion, creating a secret society funded by brothels, or searching for gold. They scrounged desperately for money, and sought escape through sex or murder. They bemoaned the death of God or planned to become supermen. The chief madman, for example, formed half-baked plans for a military coup inspired by Mussolini and talked of building poison gas factories and laboratories to develop typhus and bubonic plague.

The narrative was unwieldy, plodding and disjointed. Written in the third person, it wasn't improved by the appearance halfway through of a first-person commentator outside the action of the novel, occasional footnotes that sought to tie up loose ends, and a reference to the death of one of the main characters who at the story's end was still breathing. In any case, the novel was less concerned with the gritty details of the city and urban life than with the characters' anguish, fantasies of redemption and philosophizing at the drop of a hat. The dialogue, doubtlessly reflecting their disordered minds, was unrealistic and improbable. The most memorable example: "I love you so much that just to please you I've studied how a blast furnace and a Bessemer converter work."

Arlt's writing has won praise for capturing the angst of the Argentinean society of his time, on the eve of a depression and military coup followed by decades of instability. And for expressing the disordered outlook of the lost inhabitants of any modern city. While this reader can appreciate his literary importance, it was impossible to admire or enjoy the actual writing. Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground expressed more powerfully a character's alienation from society. And something like Hubert Selby, Jr.'s Last Exit to Brooklyn was a much more riveting portrait of modern lost souls, their dreams and their environment.

The Seven Madmen didn't inspire me to read more of Arlt's novels; one was enough. Some of his short stories that've been translated into English since the 1970s ("One Sunday Afternoon," "Small-Time Property Owners") omitted the philosophizing and obsession with secret societies, contained more concise, skilled expressions of his characters' outlooks, and were enjoyed more. His Sketches from Buenos Aires (1933), collecting his newspaper columns that won popularity during his lifetime, apparently hasn't been translated into English. Neither have his two collections of short fiction, The Little Hunchback (1933) and The Gorilla Handler (1941). - http://www.amazon.com/review/RXP04T3OU8VIR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=185242592X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Reader in Tokyo]

Acclaimed Spanish avant-garde playwright Arrabal has delivered himself of a bracingly intelligent, caustically funny first novel. Rebellious, artistic, ex-Jesuit seminarian Elias Tarsis, an Andorran Spaniard, is locked in struggle with Marc Amary, a coldly brilliant Swiss physicist turned financial speculator and Marxist terrorist. The battlefield: the final game of the world chess championship. Ostensibly the antithesis of one another, each protagonist increasingly appears to be the other's doppelganger, as the book progresses with the aid of diagrams and flashbacks of their lives. Tarsis is convinced that Amary is behind the Paris kidnapping of a top-ranking politburo official and the ensuing demand that the Soviet Union bomb the Saudi Arabian oil fields. This mysteryand the matchare resolved to considerable effect with a surprising twist. Despite a tendency to be overly didactic, this is a stimulating examination of how emotion drives intelligence and how the innocent become pawns in the cycle of evil and human suffering. - http://www.amazon.com/Tower-Struck-Lightning-Fernando-Arrabal/dp/0140130217/[Amazon boilerplate]

Artmann, born in 1921, is one of the most remarkable experimental writers of his generation. An Austrian, in the 1950s he was the founder of The Vienna Group with Rühm, Bayer, Wiener and Achleitner. The group’s black romanticism allied with a linguistic scepticism partly derived from Wittgenstein had a great influence on German letters. The Quest for Dr. U is like all Artmann’s works: protean, spanning and subverting all genres (detective fiction, romantic novels, heroic poetry, dada related experiment). Its hero pursues the ghastly Dr. Unspeakable, an ultimate villain, across continents, through situations alternately bizarre and commonplace, always enmeshed in ways of writing text. Dr. U remains a mystery, perhaps he is "not I": a wonderful modernist novel, humorous and entertaining to boot. - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0947757562/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
This is the book that started the schoolchild genre subsequently defined by '1066 and All That' and Molesworth's various manuals such as 'Down with Skool' and 'Whizz for Atoms'. As with 'The Young Visiters', the grammar, the language and the authorial viewpoint of those classics contribute much to our enjoyment. But unlike its descendants, 'The Young Visiters' wasn't written by an adult ... probably.

To my knowledge, there isn't an audiobook version of the full text. But there are a couple of gushing extracts contained on the Naxos compilation '1000 Years of Laughter' which demonstrate that it isn't just the troubled spelling which make the book so amusing. The introduction to those extracts lead us to believe that JM Barrie, who wrote the introduction, could have had much to do with the entire work. Certainly once Barrie had died, she never wrote again, but my feeling is that the nine-year-old Ashford probably was the author. The story is less than 60 pages long, and can be enjoyed in a couple of sittings, then repeatedly re-read.

This work is likely to experience a dramatic surge in popularity this year. A TV adaptation starring Jim Broadbent (of 'Moulin Rouge' fame) will be broadcast, and this recently overlooked masterpiece will return to prominence once again. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VXV5LHW8OUL/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0897333659&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful[Gavin Wilson]

Asturias, Miguel Angel

[[Mulata]]
*Mulata* (1982)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Mulata-Miguel-Angel-Asturias/dp/0380585529/[Amazon]

*****
Mulata by Miguel Ángel Asturias. Novel reading as hypnotic, language-induced hallucination, a powerful drug propelling us to fly, walk, crawl and squirm over and through lush, green Guatemalan Hieronymus Bosch-like landscapes, a world where stalks of corn talk and people can, at the drop of a banana, transform into macaw-dwarfs, spider-parrots and everything else imaginable. Since there are a number of splendid reviews already posted here, as a way of having some fun and as a tribute to my love of one of the most magical of magical realist Latin American authors, here is my tale of his mythical half-brother, Carlos Asturias:

This one’s about a soccer match where the team in white is angles and the team in read, devils: the winter controls life after death. Those were the words of Carlos Asturias, author, a man who spoke about his stories in a rich basso profundo, and afterwards, because I agreed to be his translator, handed me dozens of his stories stuffed in a cardboard box when I departed.

Since then I’ve spent the last twenty-four sleepless hours voraciously reading his work. Whether about plotting revolution in a tin shanty on the outskirts of Jalapa or how a peasant is reduced to digging form worms to feed his starving family, his storytelling is wildly inventive and explosive, written in a rich, eloquent prose.

It isn’t true that Carlos Asturias’s father was a bear, but having seen that massive beard and barreled torso covered over with curly-brown hair, you would think his mother, human maybe, but his father, definitely a bear, a lost grizzly driven out of the Northwest by forest fires, stumbling through Mexico and then driven again across the plains of Guatemala, where half-blind, burned and filled with rage, mounted a mestizo who eventually gave birth to a bear-boy, who grew up to be Carlos Asturias.

I stood up and peered into a mirror reflecting a second mirror on the opposite wall, creating a tunnel of closet-sized living rooms bending in infinite regress, a gaunt, sallow-skinned face in each room. That face belonged to me, I suppose, and was attached to a lanky body pushed to exhaustion by reading and brooding over the stories of Carlos Asturias.

He wrote all types of stories. A horror story were an obese washerwoman returns to her village for her mother’s funeral. She waddles up a twisted dirt road and reflects on her childhood: the tortillas, the guaycan trees, the sad-faced monkey she kept as a pet, but most of all her mother, the anchor of the family, as solid as the mountain she could see from her bedroom window. The washerwoman finds her village in ruin, her family’s house empty and the devil sleeping in her mother’s bed.

Mentioning the devil reminded me of the story Carlos Asturias was working on currently, the soccer match where angels are playing devils, where the outcome determines the fate of the human race. I wanted to know how the game ends.

And where did Carlos Asturias learn to speak such fluent English? Not even a trace of an accent. He hasn’t been in this country, Gringoland as he calls it, for more than a year. Truly a man of many talents. Looking at his large round eyes that seem to have the shine of bronze, my guess is he will have the devils win with three goals, one for the father, one for the son and one for the holy ghost.

Speaking of Gringoland, he wrote a satire where Guatemala breaks off after an earthquake and floats up next to Florida. United States politicians toy with the idea of making their new land the fifty-first state, or then again, walling it off, creating one giant tourist attraction. When a reporter asks about the Spanish-speaking people living there, all the politicians laugh derisively,

There’s also a wonderful story involving a walleyed prisoner who digs a hole in his cell with his bare hands. Down, down he goes. He discovers a paradise at the bottom of his hole, a land replete with bananas, mangoes, papayas, oranges and populated by long-legged maidens of every race. And the prisoner is the only man. One problem, though. Oxygen is in short supply. So the prisoner alternates between paradise at night and jail during the day.

I wondered why Carlos Asturias needed a translator at all. What was my link with this fantastic man? In the hope of gaining insight, I continued to relate the stories to what could very well be his past.

Like the one where a panther preys on a village, killing scores of women and children, until one fearless boy ventures off with his machete to kill the animal. However, when the boy encounters it in the jungle, he teaches the panther to dance. He then returns to the village with the dancing panther only to decapitate the creature on the steps of the church.

But there’s at least one story that can’t be strictly autobiographical. It’s where a man contracts a disease that eats away so much of his flesh, he orders his wife to amputate his arms and legs, which she does. Afterwards, since he isa pain-racked stump, he orders her to bury him alive. The wife, a sea of tears, digs a grave, but in an act of compassoin, slits her husband’s throat before she buries him. The husband could have been Carlos Asturias’s father, brother or friend, but not the author himself, unless, of course, he’s learned to transcend the laws of nature.

Or the laws of nature were transcended for him. Like in the piece where a new figure of a man or woman appears mysteriously on a mural every morning. Correspondingly, the real man or woman whose figure is depicted is nowhere to be found. Diego, the story’s main character, stands guard at the mural one night. As a new figure crystalizes on the mural, he covers it over with white paint. When Diego returns home, he discovers the military had been searching for his brother, Sergio. Fortunately, Sergio narrowly escaped, hiding himself in a barrel of flour.

Again, what was Carlos Asturias’s life apart from his literary endeavor? Undoubtedly, I had some good clues. Like his connection with music. There was an entire series about musical instruments. For instance, an Indian flute, a zul, that is good for rainmaking; a set of bells used as an aphrodisiac, a guitar that becomes a symbol for yearning, romance, loss, grief, and finally death. Speaking of clues that could be personally revealing, how about all the war stories – among families, neighbors, an entire nation drenched in blood.

Putting aside music and bloodshed, undoubtedly my favorite story was the one where an architect wanders into what he thinks is a garen but is actually a labyrinth. The hapless architect meanders for hours among the hedges, nearly abandoning all hope until he discovers a trapdoor leading down into a tunnel. He descends only to find that the tunnel is the beginning of yet another labyrinth, this time one made of slabs of rock. Hour after weary hour the architect fumbles aimlessly in the made of darkness, until he comes upon another trapdoor. He goes through, the stone door slamming shut behind him. When hi eyes adjust to all the bright lights, he sees a name on the door. The architect is transfixed, the name turns out to be his own, he has arrived at his very own office. Or has he really? Is this office, this building, this city the one he’s know all his life or is what he’s experiencing simply another turn in the cavernous labyrinth?

More than any of the others, I pondered this story as I leaned my elbow against the wall and kept staring at all the gaunt faces in the mirror blankly staring back at me.

Later, I left my apartment and was walking along the street to catch a subway to meet Carlos Asturias. A beggeer approached me for a handout. Not an unusual event; this city is crawling with people with their hands open for spare change. I stopped and looked at him for a moment but resumed walking. There was something about thi beggar, though that I couldn’t shake: the red bandana knotted around his forehead, the way he leered with four rotten yellow teeth, two bottom teeth pointing outward and two crooked top teeth between them. This beggar was familiar to me, but I couldn’t quite figure out why.

I tried thinking about Carlos Asturias, however this time the author was all jumbled up with the beggar. Carlos Asturias wore a red bandana and leered with the beggar’s four yellow teeth. The beggar, in turn, had a full-grown beard of curly brown hair, staring at me with round eyes the color of bronze and asked for change with Carlos Asturias’s basso profundo.

And a few minutes later, when I entered the subway station I saw a quartet of earnest-looking men huddled around a tall, skinny guy speaking in whispers. I speaker glared at me as if I were his enemy. Startled, I turned my head away and paced to the other end of the platform, hiding myself in the crowd.

Fortunately, the headlight was in sight; the train pulled into the station. Relieved, I crammed in the front car among the throng and reached for a strap overhead. Added to my feelings about the beggar, that band of suspicious characters at the station made my skin crawl. Those men reminded me of another group, but for the life of me I couldn’t make the connection.

Once again, I tried thinking of Carlos Asturias. This time, not only was he interchangeable with the beggar, my imagination put him in the middle of that gang at the station, speaking in whispers just like their tall, skinny leader.

I tried not to think at all. Instead, I scanned the faces of everyone stuffed in the car with me: secretaries and bookkeepers and managers all going to work, students on their way to school, down-and-outers going who knows where. My eyes rested on a well-groomed gentleman reading a magazine. He has round horn-rimmed glasses and sported a Pancho Villa mustache. Where have I seen him before? I kept looking. Then it hit me! With the force of a billy club cracking my skull. As if the weight of the entire crowd was suddenly standing on top of my head. What triggered my memory was the gentleman raising his magazine so I could see the cover: Architect’ Digest. He fit the description of the architect in Carlos Asturias’s story. More than fit, he exactly fit! But that was only the beginning. I now recalled how the beggar on the street resembled the peasant who dug for worms to feed his starving family. And the men at the station – they were the ones plotting revolution in a tin shanty on the outskirts of Jalapa.

I broke into a sweat. After all, whose apartment was I riding toward but that of the author himself. Interesting man, my ass. A sorcerer more likely. And to think it was my intent to simply exchange pleasantries, to let him know how much I enjoyed his work and looked forward to translating his stories. Now, I focused on just one question: who was going to win his diabolical soccer match, the angels or devils? Let him be the one to start a conversation about my seeing his characters in the flesh. But so doing, I reasoned, I’d have a clearer idea of what kind of magician I was really dealing with here.

I looked again at the architect. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a chance of speaking with him. Wouldn’t that have made for an interesting conversation?! He stood near the door on the other side of the subway car and the way we were packed in, I would have been lucy to move six inches in his direction. Besides, he got off at the next stop.

I started looking for the other characters of Carlos Asturias’s stoires: the walleyed prisoner who found paradise in a hole, the obese washerwoman returning to her village, flour-covered Sergio, the young boy with his machete, the husband who was a pain-racked stump. I looked for them all -- in the subway car, on station platforms, then after I got off, along the sidewalks, driving in cars. I kept looking and looking but it was as if someone flipped a switch – his characters where there this morning, but as sooon as I started actively seeking them out, there were nowhere to be found.

When I finally arrived at Carlos Asturias’s apartment, he was sitting in the dark watching television without the sound, the sickly bluish glow bathing his face and beard.

I maintained my resolve. I asked: How is your story going? Who do you have winning the soccer match?

His response caught me off guard. Not taking his eyes from the set he said: You can find out for yourself, senor.

I asked: What do you mean?

Carlos Asturias pointed to the screen. Let’s follow the game together, he said.

I could only see the back of the set from where I stood, so I walked around next to Carlos Asturias. A soccer team was taking the field, a team in red uniforms. Enough was enough. I told Carlos Asturias in an even tone that I could read, translate and watch many things but I would not be a spectator to his fiendish game. He only grunted in response. I left him there in his room, his eyes still glued to the tube.

Too agitated to wait for an elevator, I took the stairway. His face, his voice, the stories, the characters in the flesh, the soccer match, it all clicked in my head with the rapid click-click-click of castanets. But before I knew it, other men were trotting down the stairway with me. Suddenly I was wearing gloves, different shoes and different clothes – the uniform of a goalkeeper. And the others around me – they were also wearing uniforms, soccer uniforms, white ones with gold numbers on the back. Another turn in the stairway and we were all in a tunnel. I heard an ear-splitting roar – the tunnel lead into a stadium and the roar came from the largest crowd I’ve ever seen. My heart pumped pure adrenalin as we took the field against the team in red. This was going to be some soccer match. After all, so much was riding on the final score. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVED93F3D9E7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380585529&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

[[A_Dodo_at_Oxford]]
*A Dodo at Oxford: The Unreliable Account of a Student and His Pet Dodo* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Dodo-Oxford-Unreliable-Account-Student/dp/0953443825/[+http://www.amazon.com/Dodo-Oxford-Unreliable-Account-Student/dp/0953443825/+]

*****
In the spring of 2008, a remarkable book turned up in the Oxfam bookshop in St Giles, Oxford. The small printed octavo volume was at first sight unassuming: its covers and some of its pages were missing, and a number of the remaining pages had been defaced or damaged. Beneath the non-existent covers, however, was the first volume of A Bird Considered, printed in 1695: a previously unknown work that is an account by an Oxford student of his experiences keeping a dodo as a pet.

Or is it? The authors admit that no library catalogues have previously recorded the existence of A Bird Considered. Although they date its events with some confidence to 1683, various details in the narrative are inconsistent. The book’s imprint clams it is a product of Oxford University Press, but the Press’s archives have no trace of it. Even the author’s identity is anonymous, and the editors have not been able to identify a suitable candidate.

Once you’ve read a few pages, though, the question of whether or not the narrative is true quickly loses importance. Instead you will be falling for the charm and warmth with which the unknown student tells his story. Unspecified circumstances – unclear due to the loss of some of the book’s pages – result in him being bequeathed a captive dodo by a dying Dutchman. Inspired by the burgeoning scientific movement going on around him in Oxford, and assisted by his friends Mr Flay and Mr Sawyer, the student resolves to study the dodo’s habits.Each month he carefully records its weight, height, and diet: ‘a frog, cobnuts, apples (many), crab apple, bread (any)’. He reproduces sketches of the dodo’s features, and tries to record the dodo’s call in musical notation. He conducts controlled experiments to test the dodo’s memory and its cognitive powers.

Quickly, however, the author’s affection for the dodo grows, and so does the reader’s. Although it ‘makes a prodigeous mess about my Room’, and has a ‘payneful crye’, the student is won over by the dodo’s attachment to him: ‘he runs always to me as I am the one to feed him (and he is ever hungry)’. After the dodo is briefly stolen then retrieved after the student gives chase, it ‘was a sorry sight indeed, all a-quiver when we got him out of the sack’. Thankfully it recovers after the administration of French brandy. Sawyer then starts to keep a diary ‘supposedly written by the Bird himself; for example: Ate an Apple. Counted to one hundred. Courted a pigeon &c’. By the end of the book, the dodo’s intelligence and the bond he has developed with his master – and his master with him – are in no doubt.

Meanwhile the book also reveals incidental details about the social history of Oxford in the 1680s. The author struggles to pay his rent and clashes with his landlord (placated by the offer of the dodo’s dung for his vegetable garden). He nurses an artist friend, Mr Tompkyns, and goes to see the apothecary and a wisewoman. He goes on an unsuccessful trip to visit Elias Ashmole, and attends the visit to Oxford by the Duke of York (the future James II). He also records impressions of other Oxford figures. Particularly intriguing are a series of dreams related by Flay, which bear comparisons with the wilder prophecies and revelations that were commonplace thirty years beforehand. A close study will reveal certain parallels with other periods, too.

Interleaved with the text, which is reproduced in facsimile at 100% scale, are a series of editorial annotations. Some of these deal with the provenance and reliability of the text, but most provide glosses and context on the book’s events. Collectively these form a wonderful kind of late-seventeenth century miscellany, covering not just contemporary Oxford but a wide range of other subjects. If you didn’t know about Charles II’s ostriches, early shorthand, or Dwarf Gibson then you will after reading this book. Like all the best footnotes, many of the annotations are improved through their quiet but dry wit, particularly the comments on the book’s proofs that have unaccountably crept into the finished version.

And beyond the text and its footnotes, A Dodo at Oxford is also a modest yet sophisticated meditation about the nature of the seventeenth-century book. This is not a straightforward facsimile of a uniform text. Printed annotations mingle with scribbled notes and graffiti in the margins. Authorial voices are inconsistent: the editors’ commentary has to compete with ephemera left in the book by previous owners, a child’s crayon drawings, and a marginal game of noughts and crosses. Newspaper cuttings, fragments from other texts, pictures, printed ephemera, and even a squashed spider are pressed into the pages in the manner of a commonplace book. All this combines to create a confusing and disorientating experience, which gestures at the fact that our own concept of “the book” was not necessarily the same as that held by early modern readers.

There are also a series of detailed appendices for readers who want an explanation of the differences between twenty-first century and seventeenth century books. These explain bibliographical issues such as ligatures, page signatures, kerning, and the long S. They also tell the story of the typefaces and printer’s ornaments used in the book: a wonderful reproduction of the Fell Types commissioned by John Fell for the Oxford University Press. Reproductions of contemporary maps of Oxford are also provided to further orientate the reader.

All of which makes A Dodo at Oxford a real treat. Newcomers to seventeenth-century England will be sucked in by the picaresque charm of the student and dodo’s adventures. Those familiar with the period will enjoy reading a new, hitherto unknown voice’s account of the scientific revolution. Those who know their book history will enjoy the book’s meta-commentary on early modern books and printing. - https://mercuriuspoliticus.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/review-of-a-dodo-at-oxford/[Nick at Mercurius Politicus]

[[Miss_Hargreaves]]
*Miss Hargreaves* (1940, 2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Hargreaves-Bloomsbury-Group-Frank-Baker-ebook/dp/B004G5YX26/[Amazon]

*****
Summary: Norman Huntley and his friend Henry are visiting an old church and while speaking to the keeper, on a lark, they invent an eighty-plus old woman, Miss Hargreaves, giving her quite an eccentric character, a cockatoo, and a bath she takes with her everywhere. Still having a good laugh they write a letter to this fictional character at the hotel where they've got her staying on her travels. The lark takes a downward spiral when they receive a reply back and shortly afterwards Miss Hargreaves arrives in the village complete with cockatoo and bath. She latches onto Norman like a dear, long lost friend and Norman's once sedate life as choir member, organist and bookstore helper turns upside down with the havoc created by the imaginary but very real Miss Hargreaves.

Comments: This book is simply put, a pure delight! Though written in 1940, the story is set sometime prior WWII and with an offhand remark about WWI we can surmise the story takes place in the 1920s or early 30s. The wonderful British village life filled with a variety of characters is a joyful story. Miss Hargreaves is a most eccentric character and her appearance turns the conventions of the town topsy-turvy. She descends upon Norman and completely takes over his life with her devotion. Creating episode after episode within the village and church community Baker's novel starts off as a hilarious farce. But when Norman can't take it anymore, close to losing his girlfriend, he tells Miss Hargreaves he's done with her and she can do as she like. This causes Miss H. to disappear for some weeks and Norman realizes that he's become a bit fond of the old girl. When Hargreaves returns she's not the woman she was before, she snubs Norman, puts on airs and her former escapades are completely forgotten as she becomes the new centre of the village's society.

Norman and Miss Hargreaves's relationship is a wonderful story. I often felt it compared to that of a parent and a child, with Norman taking the parental role since he 'created' Miss Hargreaves. Miss H. starts off as the doting child thinking Norman is the centre of her universe then after an argument she turns into the defiant teenager who ignores Norman and does what she wants. At this point Norman realizes the feelings he has for Miss H. are genuine and he loves her as a parent; he tries to make her see reason and is forever turned away, banging his head against a wall, and yet he keeps returning for more as his love is coupled with responsibility. While the story is filled with whimsy, there are also to be found great moments of pathos and the ending will tug at your heart strings.

Both Norman and Miss Hargreaves are astounding characters. While they appear to be at odds for the majority of the book, there are profound moments that they share together sometimes through speech and other times simply through a shared look. They are very compelling characters not soon to be forgotten. The secondary characters are also full of life from Norman's little sister Jim, who taunts him frequently, to the church's righteous Dean, who is a bit too full of himself, to Norman's scatterbrained bookstore owner father, to Henry, the one who helped Norman create Miss Hargreaves yet can't quite believe it isn't all some trick.

A delightful book, highly recommended to fans of British cozies. The author wrote fifteen novels and I certainly wouldn't mind trying another. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNK47XMMX6WN/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G5YX26&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text[Amazon Customer]

Ball, Hugo

[[Flametti]]
*Flametti, or The Dandyism of the Poor* (1918, 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Flametti-Dandyism-Poor-Hugo-Ball/dp/1939663032/[Amazon]

*****
...Ball's novel Flametti, or the Dandyism of the Poor, completed in 1916 at the height of the Dada gatherings at the Cabaret Voltaire, is words, real words, used to produce real, straightforward meanings. In this sense, it is not the Dada we are familiar with. But what words! And what meanings! It is not often I read a novel so enthusiastic and unconstrained (and so funny) in its use of language and in its building of worlds.

The subject of Flametti is the vaudeville circuit in Switzerland in the nineteen-teens. Max Flametti, the protagonist, is the Herr Director of a small band of artistes attempting to scrabble together a living in the gutters and back-alleys of Zurich during the War. It is Flametti's vision of the world that is most astonishing and delightful. For Flametti the police are "superfluous pests" and "vermin! Lazy, insufferable bums!" The yodeler in his troupe is "one evil, crooked rib." The pianist is an "abominable woman!"; "A vampire." Flametti's wife has hair "pickled in peroxide"; the yodeler delivers "delicious retaliation"; her husband, fork in midair, turns the color of cheese. Flametti's world is visceral, surprising, and in my experience, laugh-out-loud funny.

For all its humor Flametti is a tragic novel. The novel opens with Flametti, broke yet optimistic, fishing for dinner in the polluted river while prostitutes and schoolchildren look on. Flametti is struggling to find the funds to pay a cohabitation fine. He tries fishing, and he tries drug deals, and finally he returns to vaudeville, seeking success with "The Indians," his triumphant parody of American history. Flametti looks to America for authenticity and he looks to vaudeville for art...

Despite their poverty, Flametti's artistes live decadent lives (hence the "dandyism"), and it is easy to lose sympathy for their position. There is rape; there are drugs; there is war. When Herr Leporello, the frog contortionist, is sent to battle, the eyes of his wife Lydia cling to him "like empty, rain-drenched sunflowers in the fall." Lydia is known for cruelty and hysterics; she is not known for loving her husband. None of us, as it happens, love her husband. In the same way, perhaps, we are not sorry to see a man guilty of sex crimes tried and convicted.

Nonetheless, here the army, the police, and the press are the enemies of freedom and of creative expression. In a line often quoted in promotional materials, Hugo Ball wrote, "This little novel contains my whole philosophy on 200 pages. Love for those who are on their knees. For the outcasts, the crushed, the tormented." ...

The pointed, hilarious, violent, and nuanced words appear in fluid and eccentric translation by Catherine Schelbert, a translator for Parkett who won a PEN award for this translation. Schelbert's prose contains wordplay and poetry; it sparks and dances the plot forward. The volume is illustrated by the Israeli-born, Copenhagen-based artist Tal R, whose original prints offer a hallucinatory interpretation of the novel.

In one of my favorite illustrations, Flametti emerges out of an audience of disembodied heads merged to their top-hats, his own body reduced to cane, pocket watch, epaulets, and enormous Indian headdress. ... The scene is from Flametti's desperate performance of "The Indians," and it shows him in all of his comic glory: part Delaware chief Fireglow; part stagemaster; part clown. Here Flametti is dignified, and bold, and ambitious. Here Flametti is racist, and sexist, and pitiful. Here Flametti is high, and drunk, and inspired. Here public opinion is with Flametti, and for one brief, laughable moment, he shines.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/Ball-Hammer-Balls-Tenderenda-Fantast/dp/0300083734/[Amazon]

*****
Ball and Hammer is a like a six-hand piano piece. Seated at the bench are the long deceased founder of Zurich Dada, Hugo Ball; the contemporary artist, Jonathan Hammer; and the well-regarded critic-scholar, Jeffrey Shnapp. The piece they play is built around Ball's visionary novella-memoir, Tenderenda the Fantast, which is a bit like trying to build a temple around a hallucination.

Hammer and Schnapp brilliantly riff in and around Ball's memoir: the former with his zany illustrations, a provocative essay and his translation of Ball; the latter with a razor sharp-edged introduction and an array of learned notes. The mix works. It's hard to tell where one takes over and the other leaves off.

This is no conventional university press book from the standpoint of production values. It's graphically dazzling, has twenty-plus splendid color illustrations, and is at least as much fun as a ride on one of those Twister roller coasters.

I recommend it highly for yourself or for that distinctive gift to an eccentric friend or loved one who loves Dada.
It makes nice in your brain and looks just as nice on your coffee table. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R328Z0HZIOVXMV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300083734&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[George C. Finley]

*****
" In The King Amaz’d, Torrente Ballester offers up a kind of political fairy tale, employing an ironic tone and wry humor to give a cross-sectional glimpse of 17th century Spain and in particular the machinery of power. He dispenses with the sumptuous detail of many historical novels, instead choosing to push the furniture against the walls to let a few key events and ideas have plenty of room, and giving just enough specifics to pinpoint the story in Madrid during the early years of Philip IV’s reign. Neither the king’s name nor that of the capital is ever mentioned, however, and this detached distance lends the book its fairy tale atmosphere. Nevertheless, the narrator occasionally provides evocative period details, such as when a character riding in a coach complains, “I need to pee” and is told: “Just pick up that cushion where your bottom is. I’m sure you’ll find a hole underneath.”

The novel’s imaginative opening is written so assuredly that one can’t help but sit up and take notice: the capital has been plunged into a sudden chaos of supernatural events: witches seen flying across the night sky; a sulfurous crater opening in a street; rumored sightings of an immense serpent said to have wrapped itself around the palace. These prove a kind of mass hysteria (“everybody was talking about the events, but nobody had seen them”) that occurs coincidental with the novel’s main event: the 21-year-old king, following an initiatory experience with a well-known prostitute, has asked to see the queen naked, rather than (another amusing period detail) clothed on every part of her body but where necessary to ensure continuation of the royal line. This innocent request produces a disruption of state that sends clerics and bishops scurrying to heated conference talks that devolve hilariously into behind the scenes scheming, echoed by the network of hidden passageways and secret doors of the palace and capital. Popular opinion runs amok. Machinations are put into motion in the palace – where “decency doesn’t exact thrive in [the] corridors” - to optimize certain outcomes and careers. The novel uses this precipitating event to explore the relationship between sex and state and religion, rulers and ruled, and political power versus personal will. It shares with Leopoldo Alas’ 19th century La Regenta a focus on the thorny zone where human sexuality and Spain’s Catholic clergy intersect, a dynamic apparently little changed in two hundred years." - http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2014/09/gonzalo-torrente-ballester-king-amazd.html[Seraillon]

*****
Likened to James Joyce and Franz Kafka, W.N.P. Barbellion's Journal is one of the great diaries and caused a sensation when first published in 1919. Begun when its author was 13 years old, the Journal at first catalogues his misadventures in the Devon countryside - collecting birds' eggs, spying girls through binoculars - but evolves into a deeply moving account of his struggle with multiple sclerosis. Yet, for all its excruciating honesty, W.N.P. Barbellion has an extraordinary lust for life. As Zeppelins loomed above South Kensington, the humor and beauty he found in the world around him - in music, friendship, nature and love - deepens not just the tragedy of his own life, but the millions of lives lost during the First World War. W. N. P. Barbellion ( Bruce Frederick Cummings)(1889-1919) was a naturalist by profession working at the Natural History Museum. He suffered ill-health from childhood, and, when rejected for active service in the First World War, discovered he was suffering from what is now known as multiple sclerosis. His distinctive pseudonym was created in the following way. The initials stood for three people he deemed failures: W(ilhelm) N(ero) P(ilate), and the surname, Barbellion, was taken from a sweetshop in Bond Street. Bruce Frederick Cummings, or, to use his exotic, comical pseudonym Wilhelm Nero Pilate Barbellion (1889-1919) is undoubtedly one of the finest diarists that England has produced. The chances are, however, that you have never heard of him; why is he worthy of such praise? Cummings was born in Barnstaple, Devon, in 1889, an ambitious, self-taught naturalist, who gave up his career in journalism for a prestigious post at the Natural History Museum in South Kensington. He was undoubtedly respected in his work at the museum, in a branch of entomology, and provided advice on the pressing subject of louse infestation to the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War One. He was not, however, by any means a famous public figure; and his diary contains nothing of the great and the good, with the solitary exception being an awkward luncheon with a minor aristocrat, ruined by an unfortunate faux pas ('It was a Turkish cigarette with one end plugged up with cotton-wool — to absorb the nicotine — a thing I've never seen before. I was so flurried at the time that I did not notice this and lit the wrong end.') Does this book's strength lie in social history? Certainly, it contains some fascinating detail about life in Edwardian London — a visit to Petticoat Lane; a working-class mother breast-feeding on an omnibus; Zeppelin raids; a visit to the White City — but these are not the meat of the book. The core is Cummings/Barbellion himself: his own life history; his warped sense of humour; his struggle with multiple sclerosis (a condition, initially kept from him by well-meaning doctors, which thwarted his career and lead to his untimely death); his own excoriating self-analysis/dissection of his motives and character. His prose, full of wry wit and humour, is also exceptional. If you doubt this, consider that H.G.Wells, who offered a preface to the printed book, was widely believed to be the author behind the unlikely pseudonym. In short, the beauty of 'The Journal of a Disappointed Man' is Barbellion's personality shining through every aspect of his writing. One is reminded of that other great diarist, Kenneth Williams. By the book's conclusion, I guarantee that you will long for the author to continue writing, and escape the inevitable, tragic end that awaits him. - http://www.amazon.com/Journal-Disappointed-Man-W-N-P-Barbellion/dp/1490400990/[Amazon boilerplate]

[[Bestiary]]
*Bestiary: Being an English Version of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Bodley 764* (2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Bestiary-English-Version-Bodleian-Library/dp/085115753X/[Amazon]

*****
"Bestiary" is a translation of a medieval book about animals, originally written in Latin during the 13th century, somewhere in England. The main source for this bestiary was another bestiary, compiled during the 12th century, and also translated to English as "The Book of Beasts". Thus, the text of the two books are very similar. If you just want to buy one of them, I recommend "Bestiary". The reason? The illustrations are much better, and they are all in full color! Indeed, the illustrations are taken straight from the original manuscript, making "Bestiary" not just a translation of an ancient book, but also an example of medieval (Gothic) art.

We are used to a modern, scientific view of nature and animals. The Middle Ages saw things differently. Animals weren't seen as random products of blind, natural forces. They were created by God for the edification of the human race. Indeed, Adam named all animals in the Garden of Eden, each name reflecting their true character. Animals were not just brute beasts. They carried a moral message, directed to sinful humanity. They also carried a hidden, mystical meaning, which somehow paralleled the message of the Bible itself! All the world was seen as an enchanted, magical place, with each thing a symbol for deeper, moral or spiritual, realities.

This explains the rather strange style of "Bestiary". It's not just a collection of (often badly distorted) zoological facts. It's also a book of moral edification. The anonymous author often digresses from the "real" subject (the animals), and starts to preach Christian morality to his readers. That, too, was considered part of the subject. After a short description of the pig, the author attacks sinful gluttons and unclean heretics. The author also claims that coots take care of eagle chicks that have been rejected by their parents. The moral lesson? Animals are better than humans, who treat the children of strangers with out-most cruelty! The bestiary further claims that lions don't kill humans who prostrate before them, that they liberate captive humans, and that they never attack women. Once again, the lesson is clear: the lion has a Christian morality, while man too often hasn't. One of my favorite birds, the jackdaw, is apparently an apt symbol for chattering philosophers and heretics, not to mention gossipy and greedy men!

The mystical meaning of various animals is the most far-fetched aspect of the bestiary. All of nature somehow proved the Christian message of salvation. The virgin birth of Christ was "proven" by the claim that female vultures (!) gave birth without sexual intercourse. The resurrection was paralleled by the fiery death and re-birth of the Phoenix. The bestiary further claims that female lions give birth to stillborn cubs, but after three days, the male lion breaths life into them. This points to the resurrection of Jesus, and also to the Biblical passage "He couched as a lion, who shall raise him up?" (Genesis 49:9).

What particularly strikes a modern reader of "Bestiary" is the dismally low level of real zoological knowledge available during the 13th century. To a large extent, the bestiary was a collection of tall-tales. Indeed, many of them seem deliberately tailored to produce Christian parallels, such as the legend of lion cubs being "resurrected" on the third day. Of course, this fable-like quality makes "Bestiary" a very entertaining read. Thus, we learn that the beaver will bite off his own testicles if pursued by hunters, that a certain antelope in Africa can change its colors like a chameleon, that lions fear white roosters, or that barnacle geese grow from sea-weed! Some of the creatures in the bestiary are purely imaginery, such as unicorns, dragons, the manticore, and the eale (a deer with movable horns). Only the bat seems to be reasonably correctly described, without legendary or mystical accretions.

"Bestiary" is an entertaining read, an excellent work of art due to its full-color illustrations, and offers a fascinating look at the medieval world-view and mentality.

But if you want to know what's really shaking in the animal world, please buy a modern science book, LOL. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R123SYF69UYNDH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=085115753X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ashtar Command]

*The Deadly Percheron* (1946, 1998)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Percheron-Missing-Mystery/dp/1890208108/[Amazon]

*****
John Franklin Bardin was born in 1916 and during his lifetime he wrote ten dark or noir crime novels. He refused to recognize any difference between genres, once stating his belief there are only good and bad novels. According to Jonathan Lethem, who wrote a thoughtful and lengthy foreword to this edition, Bardin once said that Graham Green, Henry Green and Henry James were influential on his writing. The novel, Bardin's first, was published in 1946 and it is a very interesting noir novel indeed.

Amnesia and paranoia are the subjects and the characters, all unusual and distinct, sustain a complicated and bizarre plot through an abrupt but eminently satisfying conclusion. This is by no means a perfect novel, and the sixty-year-old style is sometimes disturbingly devoid of emotion. Shocking action is abruptly presented and just as abruptly disposed of. There is a fairly lengthy center section in which the amnesiac who is the protagonist, is established in his new and very much lower class life on Coney Island. Dr. George Matthews, a prominent psychologist, with a practice in midtown, and a comfortable upper class living, is confronted by a new client who arrives with a fresh hibiscus in his hair. For today's readers, especially those of us who lived through the seventies and eighties of the last century, that is nothing special, a man with a flower in his hair. In 1945, the sight was unusual to say the least.

We sense something odd and a little off kilter about the good Dr. Matthews, almost from the very beginning. He appears to have more than passing interest in the burgeoning sexuality he observes around him and he seems to identify rather too strongly with his new patient, Jacob Blunt, the man who wears a hibiscus. Blunt reveals that while he is wealthy enough to afford the counseling service of Dr. Matthews, he is working for a couple of midtown leprechauns, not Irish, he assures the doctor, American leprechauns. What's more, he is really anxious to be told that he must be hallucinating, is withdrawing from reality, and the events he is witnessing and doing are not real. He is happily losing his mind, which is far better, he believes, than being trapped in the apparent lunacy of this strange alter world.

The reader is rather suddenly brought up short when the doctor almost eagerly agrees to enter Mr. Blunt's world. From there we are drawn farther and farther into this weird world of murder, large horses, amnesia and paranoia. Events spiral at a relatively calm pace out of Dr. Matthews ken and out of his control, until the last section of the book in which a world a-tilt is set once more aright. Almost. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKO0Z74XMSLF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890208108&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[carl brookins]

[[Darkmans]]
*Darkmans* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Darkmans-Nicola-Barker/dp/0007193637/[Amazon]

*****
Ashford in Kent, with its mildly risible strapline `Gateway to Europe', should be very pleased with Nicola Barker, who has taken its mundane amenities and sprawling blight of industrial estates and turned it into a place of infinite and magical possibilities. Chief of which is the idea that, lurking in its deep suburban reaches, there might be a small worm-hole in time through which Darkmans makes his way to the present century. Darkmans is John Scoggins who was Edward the IV's court jester, (banished for cruel jokes against Elizabeth Woodville, Edward's queen), who seems able, at will, to inhabit the modern day bodies he comes across, but chiefly, that of poor Isidore (Dory), the tall, goodlooking German (who has a captivating wife, Elen, a chiropodist, also prey to Darkmans' cruelties). We first come across Dory riding bareback on a stolen horse in the fort-like kids playground of a graceless local dining hall named The French Connection. He has no idea how he got there. The only person who can `see' Darkmans is Fleet, the small five-year-old son of Dory and Elen.

A large cast of characters inhabit this superbly edgy, utterly captivating novel. Chiefly we are concerned with Dory's family and Beede, a 61 year-old who manages a hospital laundry, and his son Kane, who half-heartedly deals drugs, both of whom are plagued by foot problems. Though they live in the same house, Beede and Kane have a further grim disability when it comes to communication - and how this aspect of their life is resolved is one of the triumphs of this book. Kane's ex-girlfriend, Kelly Broad and her bottom-feeder family also feature large. Events pile up as Dory sets Kelly's Uncle Harvey on to mend his roof (the scaffolding arrives on time, but not much else happens) and Isidore's psychotic episodes intensify. Darkmans takes a holiday from Isidore and haunts Beede for a while (and this episode is wonderfully, hilariously dark), and Kane is put in the stocks (real ones) by Peta, the smart and sexy cigar-smoking woman who is doing artefact restoration work for Beede. Beede is engaged on an investigation into the history of Court Jesters, but he is also much exercised by the rapine and destruction of habitat occurring whole-scale in Ashford's local environment, chiefly due to the existence of the Channel Tunnel.

This whopping great paperback (838pp) will not be to everyone's taste. The sense of things not being quite right is suggested rather than focused upon (which gives the book its subtlety and suspense), and the writing is sometimes eccentrically punctuated. It has, however, a wonderful coherence and a sinister grace which kept me pinned to the page. It is also riotously funny. The humour is a brilliant mixture of slapstick and violence, married to a remarkable ear for incongruity. Language is its key - the variableness and instability of language is a major theme, from the casual obscenities of Kelly Broad, who gets religion in a big way but can't quite leave her working-class vernacular behind, to the reported speech of Turkish immigrant Gaffar, whose Turkish asides, often witty and adroit, are rendered in bold print, in English. This is a clever ploy and so much more effective than merely making his English pidgin.

My guess is that this book will either speak to you, or it won't. All I can say is that it spoke volumes to me and I loved every word. Shortlisted for the 2008 Booker, this is Nicola Barker's best book so far and, yes, it should have won. - http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R34O6L4J6E79ES/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007193637&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=266239&store=books[Eileen Shaw]

*****
The Washington Post review, quoted above, says it better than I can hope to. This is a really great book. As the review says, "It is one of the great American novels. Try to find it." Unfortunately, you've always had to dig to find this book. As I write this, it's been out of print for eight or nine years. If you were not already familiar with the sf/fantasy/horror/fantastic/genre scene of specialty publishers, you'd have had a hard time knowing this book was ever published. Neal Barrett is just too off the wall for mainstream publishers to understand or categorize for marketing purposes.

Unfortunately, not much has changed for The Hereafter Gang. Mojo Press, like Ziesing in 1991, has done a great job presenting this book, and I thank them for finally bringing it back into print. Luckily, though, in the year 2000 we now have the internet and Amazon.com, and souls like yourself have a slightly better chance of stumbling across this great book.

The Hereafter Gang is definitely different--from most other books, and from the rest of Barrett's awesome body of work. I guess you could call it "magical realism." It has elements of the fantastic, but it's not a genre or "category" book. It will appeal to those with an appreciation for fantastic fiction, but the sheer brilliance of the writing will also hook those with a more traditional literary bent. As you can surmise from the above Washington Post review, Barrett really goes out on a narrative limb here, but he pulls it off impressively. Buy this before it goes out of print again.

You should also try the rest of Barrett's work, though you might need to comb the used book stores for the stuff that's out of print. His "Aldair" series is a great mix of Mark Twain and Robert E. Howard--intellectual heroic fantasy. The more recent "Blues" series of books are like no other mystery/crime fiction I've ever read (except for maybe Joe Lansdale). "Through Darkest America" and "Dawn's Uncertain Light" will thrill you as well. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6X8S83C4J2AY/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1885418213[D. Read]

*****
"One can only speculate what led Harley Street physician Henry Howarth Bashford to write Augustus Carp. He appears, by all accounts, to have been a pillar of his profession and community, becoming at one point personal physician to King George VI. Although he published a number of books, both professional and literary, nothing else in his oeuvre suggests its unique genius.

It would be easy to categorise Carp as a parody, but few parodists have ever succeeded in submersing themselves into a character’s voice and viewpoint as Bashford did. Back in the decades when the book was out of print and not available in editions that trumpeted it as a “comic masterpiece” or “the funniest book in the world” right on the front cover, I can imagine an unsuspecting reader thumbing through–perhaps even reading–Carp without once suspecting that it was anything but a stone-serious memoir written by a sober gentleman of strong Christian faith.

What I find marvelous about Carp is how brilliantly the book works on two levels simultaneously. On the one hand, it is solemn, sanctimonious, humorless, and completely lacking in irony. On the other, through nothing more, in most cases, that slipping the right word into a sentence, it’s ridiculous, mocking, riotous, and dripping in irony.

...

Bashford insisted on Carp being published anonymously in 1924, perhaps sensitive to the risk that some readers might object to his characterisation of members of the High Church middle-class, and for many years after that, it was only word of mouth that kept the book’s reputation alive. Somewhere along the way, Anthony Burgess came across a copy and became the book’s champion, eventually convincing Heinemann to reissue the book in 1966 and writing an introduction for this edition. Carp was subsequently issued in paperback by Penguin in the mid-1980s and by the now-defunct Prion Books in 2000. Fortunately, all of these editions include the wonderful original illustrations by “Royal,” pen-name of Punch artist Marjorie Blood." - https://neglectedbooks.com/?p=20[Neglected Books]

This is truly a most wondrous book, every page, every paragraph even, being so wonderfully funny I read and laughed through it all. A superb satire, Augustus Carp, the most pompous and self-indulgent boor you could ever have the misfortune to meet, writes of his life thus far, from his birth to where he is now, and describes in detail the trials and tribulations he has faced [none being his fault] as well as those he has assisted, whether they wanted it or not. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FHLLY1BHOKHE/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598180355&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[I.

*****
The Tale of Tales, made up of forty-nine fairy tales within a fiftieth frame story, contains the earliest versions of celebrated stories like Rapunzel, All-Fur, Hansel and Gretel, The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. The tales are bawdy and irreverent but also tender and whimsical, acute in psychological characterization and encyclopedic in description. They are also evocative of marvelous worlds of fairy-tale unreality as well as of the everyday rituals of life in seventeenth-century Naples. Yet because the original is written in the nonstandard Neopolitan dialect of Italian-and was last translated fully into English in 1932-this important piece of Baroque literature has long been inaccessible to both the general public and most fairy-tale scholars.

Giambattista Basile's "The Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones" is a modern translation that preserves the distinctive character of Basile's original. Working directly from the original Neopolitan version, translator Nancy L. Canepa takes pains to maintain the idiosyncratic tone of The Tale of Tales as well as the work's unpredictable structure. This edition keeps the repetition, experimental syntax, and inventive metaphors of the original version intact, bringing Basile's words directly to twenty-first-century readers for the first time. This volume is also fully annotated, so as to elucidate any unfamiliar cultural references alongside the text. Giambattista Basile's "The Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones" is also lushly illustrated and includes a foreword, an introduction, an illustrator's note, and a complete bibliography.

The publication of The Tale of Tales marked not only a culmination of the interest in the popular culture and folk traditions of the Renaissance period but also the beginning of the era of the artful and sophisticated "authored" fairy tale that inspired and influenced later writers like Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. Giambattista Basile's "The Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones" offers an excellent point of departure for reflection about what constitutes Italian culture, as well as for discussion of the relevance that forms of early modern culture like fairy tales still hold for us today. This volume is vital reading for fairy-tale scholars and anyone interested in cultural history. - http://www.amazon.com/Giambattista-Basiles-Entertainment-Fairy-Tale-Studies/dp/0814328660[Amazon boilerplate]

Wolfgang Bauer is an incredible oddity, the man must be either insane or the purest form of genius. I don't believe this alone. Malcolm Green must feel the same way to have taken the time to translate this complex, hilarious, amazing piece from the well-known (at least in Europe) Austrian playwright. An out of this world journey, The Feverhead will drag you around the world, maybe even to Heaven or Hell. You might even meet ULF! Imagine it...ULF! Weird and Wacky, but extremely compelling, with twists and turns that will keep you at the tip of seat or wherever you read, this book is a treasure. Being the only in print English work of Mr. Bauer, you will feel priviliged and honored to have it in your collection to return to again and again.

[[Reruns]]
*Reruns* (1974)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0914590014/[Amazon]

*****
Back in the early `70s, Jonathan Baumbach started a non-profit publishing house with a focus on experimental metafiction called the Fiction Collective (now FC2) alongside writers Steve Katz, Peter Spielberg, Ronald Sukenick and the miserable (or so I hear) B.H. Friedman at the Brooklyn College to be run entirely by likeminded writers, editing and publishing one another's stories--it's the only publishing house I know that gives the author complete--and I mean C O M P L E T E--control over their stories--using pocket $$$ from the writer and grants from the B.C. to pay for each book's initial publication until enough copies are sold that the writer can be paid back, and to be honest I have no idea how that works, as Reruns was originally published in 1974--one of the first three FC publications: Friedman's Museum & Spielberg's Twiddledum, Twadledum--and my copy, a third printing released in 2003, is still a first edition, and undeservedly so.

In under 170 pages, Baumbach successfully builds and maintains a sort of hypersurreality, mixing together dream and film, meditating on the art of storywriting for both the printed page and the camera. His handling of things dreamlike and filmic has a very Lynchian vibe to it: any random section's goings-on would be right at home in any D. Lynch film, esp. Eraserhead.

-----
I went in on the run. The sensation of impact--the sudden shock of cold--hanging on like a bad memory. Someone came in after me. I was swimming under the water toward what looked like an American flag at the bottom of the pool when a pair of hands attached themselves to my ankles. Whoever it was--I assumed Anna--followed like an appendage. Under the American flag was the corpse of a large animal--a cow, I thought, though it's difficult to tell under water. When touched it made a mooing sound. I started to surface.
-----

There's also a lot that goes on in this short novel, so much so that it's almost impossible to keep up with, particularly if you're trying to read more than 30 pgs in one sitting. It's overwhelming, and if you can consider that a detractor, it's surely this novel's largest. It's helped a lot by the 33 short chapters (`Nights'/reruns) making up the narrator's past, and briefly a child's escape from a family of vampires straight out of old, xenophobic Hollywood.

Beyond this, I don't really know how to comment on Baumbach's wicked cool book, or how to even describe what's going on in it. Baumbach's is a world where loved ones will be intimate friends one second and strangers the next, where secretaries type with the nipples of their breasts, where friends literally disappear into thin air when attention is being paid elsewhere, where amateur snipers take up residence in your apartment, spending weeks picking off any unlucky walker, where actors (e.g., Gregory Peck) insert themselves into minor roles, and enemies are suddenly close friends, where disconnected phones are always ringing, where real life-or-death situations are averted because the camera recording them ran out of film, &c. It all makes up an often hilarious, always nightmarish pop culture mash-up, blending dreams with books and TV, and asking how these clichés and archetypes have an effect upon our lives. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R17JT1UOLMYPVE/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0914590014&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Todd Michael]

*****
"The Hospital Ship is filled to the brim with both fascinating ideas and audacious compositional techniques. What will strike the reader immediately is the influence of Bax’s training as a doctor. The authoritative lens brings a jarring realism as he renders his profession with poetic strokes. 

...

Bax’s use of quoted texts, which gain meaning through association with other quoted texts and the novel’s narrative portions, is the most ingenious (and challenging) element of the novel. Quoted texts make up around a third of the novel and are not cited (but a list is provided at the beginning). The range demonstrates Bax’s medical training and other reading habits: from K. Kräupl Taylor’s “Behavior Patterns of Groups” in The Pathogenesis of War (1963), ed. Margaret Penrose to The Robber Barons (1934) by Matthew Josephson.

Here’s a rather silly (but simple) example os how this technique works. Euan and Sir Maxinov have a half-thought out discussion on political philosophy (from a distinctly medical viewpoint) and Sir Maxinov remembers a passage from school: “Aristotle reports that the Egyptians put them to good use. They made their bow-strings from the penises of dead camels” (156). The narrative stops immediately followed by three pages of quotes about the genitals of various animals. Often the implications are far more profound. V, the woman from Saigon, tells her story to The Man from the West. Her harrowing exposition takes on additional meaning by association with various quotations from books describing Vietnam’s pre-War landscape and the atrocities instigated by American soldiers.

The final assemblage is not to be missed by fans of 70s J.G. Ballard and New Wave SF more generally. Lacking perhaps Ballard’s poignancy, The Hospital Ship still traverses distinct and alluring waters. Bax’s medical training and profession imbue the post-apocalyptical uncertainty with a veneer of certitude. An intertextual onion à la Ishmael Reed’s Mumbo Jumbo (1972)…"  - https://sciencefictionruminations.com/2017/07/20/book-review-the-hospital-ship-martin-bax-1976/[Joachim Boaz]

*How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Talk-About-Books-Havent-Read/dp/1596914696/[Amazon]

*****
Pierre Bayard's "How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read," translated superbly from the French by Jeffrey Mehlman, comes at a time when a number of experts declare that reading in America is on the decline. Since the 2004 report from the US National Endowment for the Arts documented that Americans are reading less and less, there are more distractions than ever that keep people away from bookstores and libraries. The Internet, cable television, and other forms of entertainment, as well as the pressures of work, family, and social responsibilities quickly gobble up our days. For some people, a lack of erudition presents no problem. However, for those who would like to appear knowledgeable (even if they are anything but), Bayard comes to the rescue.

The author, a Professor of French Literature and a psychoanalyst, assures us that "it is sometimes easier to do justice to a book if you haven't read it in its entirety--or even opened it." Whew, what a relief! In addition, Bayard informs guilt-ridden non-readers that they are in very good company, since "mendacity is the rule" when it comes to reading. Few individuals who wish to be taken seriously by their peers will admit to never having read certain "canonical texts," so they simply lie and pretend to have read them. The whole spectrum of non-reading is covered here: books we've never cracked open, those we've merely skimmed, books that we've never laid eyes on but have heard about from others, and those that we read years ago and have long since forgotten. When books fade from our consciousness, we might as well not have read them at all, Bayard asserts. In many cases, "Our relation to books is a shadowy space haunted by the ghosts of memory...." Therefore, if you are a non-reader, fear not; you have nothing to be ashamed of and you are certainly not alone.

The author quotes works both well-known and obscure, such as Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose," Graham Greene's "The Third Man," and Balzac's "Lost Illusions" to support his thesis. He uses intricate and arcane philosophical arguments that are almost mathematical in their precision, to "prove" that one can and should avoid delving too deeply into books. He even uses his own jargon (some of which is borrowed from other disciplines) to describe ways in which non-readers relate to unread books and to one another: screen books, inner books, phantom books, virtual libraries, and the collective library.

Although to the casual reader Bayard may seem to be playing it straight, "How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read" is brilliant and subtle satire. Amazon reviewers should take special note of the Oscar Wilde quotation that serves as the book's epigraph: "I never read a book I must review; it prejudices you so." Comments such as these that demonstrate how foolish it is to actually read the books that we talk about are so absurd (although they appear logical on the surface because they are couched in such ornate language), that Bayard ends up strengthening the opposite viewpoint. Those steeped in literature, even if they do not recall every word they have read, are generally people worth knowing; they are far more interesting to talk to than those who spout empty phrases devoid of precision or depth; people's lives are richer because of their intimate knowledge of books. They do not have to worry about surviving professional and social situations on a wing and a prayter, hoping never to be exposed as frauds who profess to have literary knowledge that they lack. Ironically, Bayard ultimately demonstrates the power of books to evoke passion, sway hearts and minds, subvert the social order, and change our lives. "How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read" is provocative, thought provoking, and great fun. Rather than pretending to read it, read it! - http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEHRXRT57W26/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596914696&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E. Bukowsky]

This is Bayley at the peak of his powers, barkingly brilliant. The thought experiments he weaves into a mosaic of energetic stories works its way to you like Borges on speed, a strange hybrid of Rudy Rucker, Italo Calvino and A. E. van Vogt - yet the core of it remains inescapably Bayley's own brand of strange sf. It's more like speculative cosmology, except Freeman Dyson would never have come up with ideas like Bayley's:

Like; what if the universe was completely filled with rock? And each of us is living in a little bubble in the rock. In other words, the basic premise of the story is impossible because the universe is not full of rock. But he's like, "what if it was?" And he goes on to describe attempts at space travel in this universe, the problems that arise, and ends the whole shebang with an orgasmic zen buzz to your frontal lobes. Wow. And then there more, each story going off on wild tangents into space and time and the lack thereof. If you think you're up for the ride, go for it. But be warned - this is NOT extrapolative hard sf, this is utterly original speculative stuff that will mess with your notions of reality and boggle the mind. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FA4VF046ZKMT/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0850312159&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[albemuth]

Bayley may the closest thing the UK has ever had to its very own Kilgore Trout: a genuinely visionary writer who most people have never heard of because much of his work appeared in transient, downmarket paperback editions that vanished almost as soon as they appeared.

This collection of short stories may well be the only Bayley book currently available in a hard-copy, tangible edition, though a number of his novels can be found as e-books in the excellent Gollancz Gateway series. The novels typically throw crazed ideas into relatively orthodox space-opera plots, told in slightly cranky prose. The short stories collected here (most of which were originally published in "New Worlds", a rather more upmarket venue than was usual for Bayley's work) are much more concentrated, with demented ideas explored in highly cranky prose (sometimes reminiscent of Lovecraft, albeit an intelligent Lovecraft, difficult as that may be to imagine). They're thoroughly bracing in their intensity, and also in their gloom and pessimism. A typical Bayley story, if there is such a thing, is a thought experiment that seems to think the laws of science can and should be ARGUED into submission. What if space was discontinuous, like the world in which chessmen travel ("The Exploration of Space")? What if the universe were made of solid rock with a few bubbles in it where civilisations could exist ("Me and My Antronoscope")? Elsewhere, something like "The Bees of Knowledge" gives an idea of what a British New Wave writer would come up with if inspired not by William Burroughs but by Edgar Rice Burroughs. "The Cabinet of Oliver Naylor" is like a mash-up of Van Vogt, Stapledon, John Buchan and Jerome K. Jerome. "All The King's Men" and "Mutation Planet" offer different variations on the idea that extra-terrestrials are going to be way beyond our ability to deal with. I genuinely don't know where to start in suggesting what "The Problem of Morley's Emission" is about. The very weakest story here, "An Overload", is similar to, and at least as good as, the best PKD short fiction from the 1950s.

These suggestions aim to give a flavour of the ideas Bayley explores, but you'll need to read the stories themselves to understand just how far Bayley can take them, and how intense that journey is. Your mental melon will be thoroughly twisted. Possibly through several higher mathematical planes. Michael Moorcock thought this book was one of the best single-author SF collections ever published. Even allowing for his life-long friendship with Bayley, he's probably right on that front. "The Knights of the Limits" is as mind-bending, intense and visionary as SF short stories get and, if you're prepared to put in a bit of effort to deal with the knotty prose and willing to accept a lack of happy endings, it's recommended without reservation. - https://www.amazon.com/Knights-Limits-Barrington-J-Bayley/product-reviews/1587153831/[Runmentionable]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0879975199/[Amazon]

*****
Seeing as how this book occupies a special place in my heart, I feel duty bound to write a quick something ...

10 years ago, in my mid-twenties, I unexpectedly got bitten by the SF bug, after reading "Wolfbane" by Pohl and Kornbluth which I found in a box of abandoned books in an alley behind the house where I lived. I struck out in search of SF paperbacks and after not too long fate would have it that I spied a copy of "The Garments of Caean" loitering towards the back of a dusty shelf in the far-flung reaches of a basement Sydney 2nd hand bookstore. I'm talking about the UK Fontana edition here, with a striking and eerie Tony Roberts cover (which does relate to the story). The premise sounded intriguing and as soon as I started reading I was hooked. After this, I read everything I could find by Bayley.

His writing style has been criticized for being limited - I would call it deceptively simple. He certainly has insights if you care to look, but it is generally concise and effectively outlines scenes and action whilst performing its primary function (like blood carrying oxygen) of delivering the IDEAS to your brain.

Garments of Caean (like all Bayley's novels) is a series of set pieces for exploring the implications of ideas, whether for sheer entertainment, like "Garment's" opening scene of treasure-looting on a godforsaken planet infested with dinosaur-like giant reptiles attacking each other with subsonics, to ideas seemingly thrown away off the cuff (the Sentient Mirror is one subtle and particularly unsettling example that sticks in my mind), or to others forming part of the plot framework and background - in this book the divergence of human cultures along the length of Tzist Arm of space and their philosophies towards attire specifically.

That's not to say it isn't a cracking good ball of yarn, unrolling at kittenish speed, either. There is pyrotechnic violence, gore, and sex of more than one persuasion (although note a scene dealing with one particular "persuasion" has been edited out of the US DAW edition pictured on this page). There are a clutch of variously a- and im-moral characters, including scientists with their heads in a theoretical dimension (a classic Bayley trope), and atypically for Bayley, some semi-developed female characters. There are ether-breathing yakuza. And a mind-blowing denouement something on the order of a galactic Day of the Triffids! (Day of the Tailors?)

If you enjoyed the Garments of Caean, I would read anything by Bayley, although real favourites for me were also The Grand Wheel, the Soul of the Robot and its incredible sequel, The Rod of Light, and the epic, brutal, nihilistic Pillars of Eternity. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZOC97WWNPD4K/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879975199&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[paperbackpacker]

*The Fall of Chronopolis* (2011)

*****
The Fall of Chronopolis (The Last and Final Days of the Chronotic Empire) by the relatively unknown British sci-fi author, Barrington J. Bayley, is one the best time travel book I've ever read. Other reviewers have suggested that this is Bayley's best as well -- I'll reserve judgment until I've read The Garment of Caen. Bayley's works live off of interesting ideas (often epic feats of the imagination). Without the allure of these ideas, his novels are husks -- characterless, often poorly written, forced, and shoddily paced. That said, Bayley's prose is just passable enough that images accompanying the ideas remain with us.

The Fall of Chronopolis crams into a fast-paced 174 pages the veritable history of the entire empire experienced by the "main" characters (facilitated by the technology of time-travel of course). The scope is vast (through time and space). The Chronotic Empire has erected a time travel stop-barrier just after the point in time of the creation of the time machine to stop tampering with this vital invention -- all other time travel (especially by the Imperial Family) is fair game.

Briefly summarized (Bayley does relish explaining and re-explaining his complicated theory of time travel throughout the work) time travel works as follows: time is made of stratum (strat) and by moving through this stratum one can emerge into orthographical time at any point in time. However, Bayley further complicates this by adding Nodes -- which move forward at a constant pace (the capital Chronopolis for example). I'm not going to try to explain this bizarre theory -- however, unlike other novels dealing with time travel, Bayley does attempt to flesh out the theoretical elements (in pseudo-scientific terms of course).

(some spoilers)

The city of Chronopolis governs the Chronotic empire by moving forward and backward, creating paradoxes, and rectifying others. The Chronotic Empire is at odds with the Hegemony, created in the future by the Traumatic sect (with drastically different beliefs than the official Church). The Hegemony attempts to preserve the Traumatic sect which spawns its own empire while the Chronotic Empire attempts to root out the Traumatics to remove the Hegemony. Enter: the time distorter controlled by the Hegemony. The time distorter removes entire cities entirely (queue inspiration for the Voyager episodes Year of Hell Part I and Part II). This weapon causes (initially) only slight disturbances in the fabric of the Chronotic Empire. These changes are gauged by Achronal Archives at Chronopolis which are protected from the outside time changes by time barriers. Here knowledge of the cities, planets, civilizations, removed entirely from the spectrum of time are preserved although the outside world NEVER knew that these cities and planets and civilizations even existed. This is perhaps the most fascinating element of the work.

The plot revolves around Captain Anton who is falsely accused of deserting his post by members of the Traumatic sect who had infiltrated his ship. He is sentenced to death as a messenger sent through the strat -- however, Anton's kill word is never uttered and his journey causes a drastic transformation. I best not give away the rest of the plot, but it involves rescuing a victim of the Traumatic sect, a large computer which speaks gibberish, a senile emperor, various disturbed members of the imperial court falling in love with their own future forms and dead bodies of their relatives, etc etc.

Bayley successfully weaves grand ideas, well-realized religions which spawn from these ideas, a plot with odd twists and turns, vivid images of corpulence and decay, battles between time ships, time paradoxes, and a fleshed out theory of time travel into a wonderful, action packed read. The third act is somewhat of a let down -- although the very end is a fascinating spin on the "save-the empire" cliché. Definitely worth checking out -- thankfully, Fall of Chronopolis was recently reprinted! - http://www.amazon.com/review/RF1T0OQ2DWM5D/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVFQV06&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Mithridates VI of Pontus]

*****
Beatty explores what it's like to be black in "postracial" America with searing, acerbic, ceaseless, absurdist humor, and by turning the tables on bigotry by having the main characters, Me (or Bonbon) and Hominy Jenkins bring back slavery and discrimination and argue for them before the Supreme Court.

This is not a novel as most understand the form. It is more of a long standup routine that rains down on you for a couple of hours, comprised of riffs on films, culture, psychology, gangs, territories, education, and Me's passion, horticulture in an urban desert. The storyline, which surfaces for sustaining air periodically, is the one line from my opening, an apparently absurd idea that illustrates how absurd what engenders it really is.

Okay, so what kind of reading experience is The Sellout: A Novel? The best way to describe it, apart from imagining yourself at a meeting of the Dum Dum Donut Intellectuals (founded by Me's psychologist father, deceased but impossible for Me to forget, gunned down by police in the street) in which Me finally arouses himself enough to fire off his riff, like the black comedian who brings life to the club on the cusp of its demise. Or, view a few Diego Rivera murals of culture, oppression, history, and revolution to get a sense of how the frequent digressions mesh to paint a picture. Or, reach further back into art history and study Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, depicting the delights (what's beyond the barrio of Dickens) to the hell in places like Dickens. In short, a ton of stuff splattered on the wall, formed into tales, taken together to impart an impression.

Now, it would be nice to quote from The Sellout, however, let's just say that the slang-slinging in Django Unchained [HD] might be tame by comparison. But wait. There is one part that might pass. That's the opening, which sets the tone of the book nicely:

"This may be hard to believe, coming from a black man, but I've never stolen anything. Never cheated on my taxes or at cards. Never snuck into the movies or failed to give back the extra change to a drugstore cashier indifferent to the way of mercantilism and mimimim-wage expectations. I've never burgled a house. Held up a liquor store. Never boarded a crowded bus or subway car, sat in a seat reserved for the elderly, pulled out my gigantic penis and masturbated to satisfaction with a perverted, yet somehow crestfallen look on my face. But here I am, in the cavernous chambers the Supreme Court of the United States of America ..." and so it goes on, intensifying.

Worth your time? Absolutely, if you'd like to make a little sense of times that seem to make no sense whatsoever. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GK7X59EPVCLX/[Amazon]

*****
The phrase that immediately comes to mind to describe Beaumont is "a poor man's Ray Bradbury", but that's entirely too derogatory for this collection of tales. Beaumont's prose can't equal Bradbury's ecstatic, beautiful collections of metaphors and descriptions—it has a distinctly hard-boiled edge, as though his style was unable to escape the pulps to the same degree that Bradbury's did. However, his sense of twisted fun and near-endless ability to come up with damn good "What if?" ideas are equal to that of his more famous counterpart; in that regard many of these stories would be perfectly at home in The Illustrated Man or The October Country. And he does have Bradbury's gift for evoking nostalgia and emotion; to name but one example, the aching, awful sadness of "The Magic Man" is genuinely moving.

What a talent we lost when he died; who knows how many more wonderful little tales and Twilight Zone episodes he would have graced us with. While Ligotti is certainly more impressive in a literary sense, this was, no contest, my favorite Halloween read this October.

Also, this will undoubtedly be the only time you'll see a collection bookended by tributes from Ray Bradbury and William Shatner. An apt duo, though I'm unclear where the Bradbury foreword came from as he'd been dead for three years prior to the publication of this edition. I like to think he has indeed succeeded in his goal to live forever and has been in contact with Penguin Classics from the afterlife. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6PG9GA9DTX1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107658&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[G.

*****
Antonio Beccadelli (1394–1471), known as Panormita from his native town of Palermo, was appointed court poet to Duke Filippo Maria Visconti (1429), crowned poet laureate by Emperor Sigismund (1432), and ended his days as panegyrist to King Alfonso V of Aragon and Naples, where he founded the first of the Renaissance Academies. The Hermaphrodite, his first work (1425–26), dedicated to Cosimo de' Medici, won him praise and condemnation. Beccadelli was a pioneer in revitalizing the Latin epigram for its powers of abuse and louche eroticism. Its open celebration of vice, particularly sodomy, earned it public burnings, threats of excommunication, banishment to the closed sections of libraries, and a devoted following. Likened to a "precious jewel in a dunghill," The Hermaphrodite combined the comic realism of Italian popular verse with the language of Martial to explore the underside of the early Renaissance. - http://www.amazon.com/Hermaphrodite-Tatti-Renaissance-Library-English/dp/0674047575/[Amazon boilerplate]
*****

*****

"In substance, The Hermaphrodite is something of a messy hodgepodge, mixing lewd, sexual and scatological poems with elegies to the dead, attacks on Beccadelli’s detractors, and purplish, flattering paeans to his patrons and followers. Much of the poem indulges in an explicit, adolescent sexual humor: crude descriptions of sexual organs and acts, with a notable, celebratory fixation on sodomy; accusations of sexual anomaly and inadequacy hurled at Beccadelli’s enemies; depictions of prostitution (“I was sweet and pleasant. My deeds pleased many,/But except for my fee, nothing was sweet to me”); even a poem in which the poet invites the sexually profligate to copulate on his own tomb and thus “honor my soul by fucking, not with incense.” - http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2015/01/things-ought-to-be-looked-at.html[Seraillon]

Vathek is a Caliph who didn't learn to rule his kingdom well, or how to behave correctly. He is primarily concerned with indulging his five senses. He is a sybarite. Extravagance being his native way, he builds five palaces onto the existing palace - one to over indulge each of his five senses to the point of satisfaction. Only Vathek is never really satisfied by anything. He always wants more power, a lovelier girl, more exotic food, a more sophisticated fragrance or a strange gift from a remote country. The fact is that Vathek is very self absorbed and when you are the Caliph, people let you get away with just about anything. It doesn't help that his mother is an evil sorceress and she enables all his bad behaviour.

Vathek builds a tower onto his palaces that gets close to heaven where supernatural forces are watching him, deciding what to do. A servant of evil disguised as a beggar comes to the palace with wondrous things Vathek has never seen before. When Vathek beholds them he is shocked. He asks the beggar many times what his name is and where the items came from. The beggar never replies. They kick the beggar repeatedly and throw him in jail. The next morning, the guards are dead and the beggar is gone. Mom does a divination and determines the beggar was more than he seems, and must be the key to power and riches of the preadimite kings. This is the path to evil, but the rewards are extravagantly outrageous. So, Mom pushes Junior to do some really rotten deeds, but he wasn't complaining. He does every rotten thing she asks.

The body of the story consists of Vathek at home and on the road indulging himself, repenting, indulging, repenting, etc. Until finally, well you will have to read the book to find out. I really enjoyed the ending. It was very creative in a cruel, everlasting way.

If you like fairytales and want a HEA, skip this one. This is more a Grimm type fairytale. Death, burned beards, lots of kicking and everlasting torment are not your average happenings for a Disney story, so don't read it to younger kids, unless you want to give them nightmares. You do get two dwarves, some geniis afrits and evil Dives(?) I'm not quite sure what an evil Dive is, but they cause untold amounts of evil, so leave them alone.

The moral of the story: be humble, be frugal, think of others before yourself. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QIK9E0F7Y64J/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0192836560[Meanwhile, Melinda]

This novel made me homesick for England. But pleasantly so. It opens in London's Trafalgar Square, which lives in my memory as the place to go on Christmas Eve. There would be a huge Christmas tree, sent over from Norway, I believe, all decorated and lit up, and hundreds of people singing Christmas carols. There's no Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square in the opening of this book. There is a body instead. It is discovered by Oliver Swithin, who has hay-colored hair that is straight and floppy. teeth that are too prominent, docile blue eyes behind wire-framed spectacles. He is wearing a tuxedo that has seen better days. Not a macho hero, one deduces almost immediately. Sir Hargreaves (Harry) Random was "floating face-down in a Trafalgar Square Fountain....with a look of mild irritation on his face, mortified in all senses of the word." Listen to this. Far above ... the rising sun was gilding the pigeon guano on Nelson's hat." (For the unknowing, Nelson's column is one of the primary features of Trafalgar Square.) There are a lot of wonderfully visual and fresh images like that throughout this well-wrought novel. Here's a description of a police officer, Sergeant Welkin: "He was an overweight man in his thirties, with a black moustache and a harsh boxer's face, who invariably reminded people of someone else they knew. He bred Burmese cats." Oliver writes a series of books about a "Foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, ex-public-schoolboy ferret named Finsbury.... giving the beast all the vices he had never possessed." The series of course becomes a critical and financial success, though not for Oliver, who isn't getting any of the money. "Hoist by your own pet," Oliver's uncle murmurs. The Finsbury books expose the infants of England to the evils of alcohol, drugs, pornography, promiscuity, soccer hooliganism, smoking, and country and western music." (Ahem! Excuse me?) Mr. Beechey very cleverly, after introducing Finsbury, obeys the dictum that if you show a ferret early in the plot, the ferret should bite someone before the end. If left to myself here, I'd quote the whole book and you wouldn't have to buy it and that would never do. Oliver as sleuth is assisted by, or sometimes desisted by, his Uncle , Inspector Tim Mallard of the Yard. He sleuths by Zodiac signs, following the trail of a serial murderer. He also yearns for Sergeant Effie Strongitharm and fantasizes her response to him with replies that range from a snorted "With *you*?" to a breathless, "At last--take me now, my shy young hero among men." He's not too successful with Effie, which is hardly surprising. There are many surprises in this book so I'm not going to tell anything about the plot progression. One big surprise almost lifted me out of bed, where I was reading. For a few pages, I was really......no that would be a spoiler. There are a lot of puns in this book, and as you've seen--much humor. Not of the slapstick kind, but my favorite kind of understated English humor that depends mostly on a very satisfying use of words. I'm looking forward to reading the next installment. I loved this book And I've decided I have to visit London next year. For sure. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLYU7TQ80BZF4/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312169361[Margaret Chittenden]

Beerbohm, Max

[[A_Christmas_Garland]]
*A Christmas Garland* (1912)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Garland-Max-Beerbohm-ebook/dp/B004UJVAN8/[Amazon]

*****
In the splendid Introduction to this edition of Max Beerbohm's A CHRISTMAS GARLAND, John Hall writes that "there has never been a better collection of parodies in English." I am no expert on the art of parody, a rare art indeed in today's world, but I suspect Hall is correct.

A CHRISTMAS GARLAND consists of seventeen pieces, averaging nine pages each, from the pen of Max Beerbohm but attributed to different literary contemporaries of his, thinly disguised by their vowelless names - such as H*nry J*m*s, H. G. W*lls, G. K. Ch*st*rt*n, Th*m*s H*rdy, and J*s*ph C*nr*d. In each of the pieces, Christmas plays a role of some sort, in some quite obliquely, in others front and center. The resulting garland is both charming and esoteric.

Of the seventeen authors I have read one or more works of nine of them. I am in no position to judge how effectively Beerbohm mimics the other eight of his subjects (four of whom - A. C. Benson, Arnold Bennett, G.S. Street, and Maurice Hewlett - I had never even heard of). But for the nine authors I know, Beerbohm's parodies are strokes of genius. So good are they that Henry James said that none of the writers satirized in A CHRISTMAS GARLAND could now write "without incurring the reproach of somewhat ineffectively imitating" Beerbohm.

Here's an example from the piece aping Joseph Conrad, the subject probably most familiar to potential readers of this review:

"The hut in which slept the white man was on a clearing between the forest and the river. Silence, the silence murmurous and unquiet of a tropical night, brooded over the hut that, baked through by the sun, sweated a vapour beneath the cynical light of the stars. Mahamo lay rigid and watchful at the hut's mouth. In his upturned eyes, and along the polished surface of his lean body black and immobile, the stars were reflected, creating an illusion of themselves who are illusions.  Within the hut the form of the white man, corpulent and pale, was covered with a mosquito-net that was itself illusory like everything else, only more so."

By the way, in this piece, entitled "The Feast", it is Christmas day and the thoughts of the white man, when he awakes, harken back to Marylebone and "a savour of especial cookery." He tells Mahamo, "It's a feast-day of my people," and Mahamo answers, "Of mine also." It doesn't take much to figure out how the story ends.

This edition from Yale University Press consists of three parts. The largest is a facsimile of the first edition of A CHRISTMAS GARLAND, as published in 1912. There also is a section of twenty-four visual caricatures of some of the seventeen subjects, as drawn or painted by Beerbohm. They too are brilliant, and the section well illustrates that "caricature can be seen as a kind of graphic equivalent of parody." Finally (though placed first in the book), there is the Introduction, which includes for each of the parodied authors a brief discussion of who they were, Beerbohm's relationship with them, and the salient characteristics of their prose that Beerbohm seizes upon and exaggerates.

A CHRISTMAS GARLAND is, to be sure, a bit of fluff. But it is inspired fluff, and it is moderately entertaining. Plus, this year marks the one hundredth anniversary of its publication. So, if you are looking for a Christmas present for a bibliophile who is also an Anglophile, might I suggest A CHRISTMAS GARLAND? And if you decide to get it, either as a gift for someone else or for yourself, do make an effort to track down this very nice hardcover edition published by Yale University Press. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RIL0DXP96L1BW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UJVAN8&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[R.

"It's a real shame that the only prior review of this book is a comment on the unpleasant smell of the reviewer's copy of the book. I'm gonna fix that.

This is a great little book of learned spoofs of Catholic dogma, hagiography, and prayers. Bellairs was a curiously well-read individual and a fabulous writer, and this little book is stuffed with obscure and very literate jokes and references. If you are familiar with Catholic practice and belief, especially pre-Vatican II, and are well read, you will get a huge kick out of this book. None of the spoofs are bad natured or insulting, but the reader must be secure in his/her faith and must possess a sense of humor about religion. If the above are lacking, you will hate this book. Otherwise, you will love it and laugh.

An example is "A prayer for the speedy demise of a bishop (To be said by a priest whose books have been suppressed or by an ambitious Monsignor.)" The prayer that follows is even more hilarious, but you'll need to buy the book.

It's a shame this book is out of print." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28HD6AR9QACJN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DKBT0[J. M. Newman]

The most satisfying edition (of only two!!) is the hardbound from 1968, which has wider pages & lets you have more of a feeling of holding it in your hands.

'One light was burning in the great central tower of the hall, and out of the half-opened casement roaring organ music trickled. Sir Bertram immediately recognized the piece as Buxtehude's Festival Fanfare for organ, tympani, and tuned bass cannon.'

Sir Bertram Crabtree-Gore, a wandering sorcerer, wanders into the Flapping Forest (as it was known) and encounters the perils therein (namely a nasty sorcerer who attacks everyone he meets with sophistry & proves they don't exist, thus turning them into stained linen napkins). Apparently wearing a Hawaiian shirt, he must brave gothic mansions and mad organists to find a Shuffly to combat the monstrous horde of napkins.

If you like Avram Davidson, you'll probably like John Bellairs. He's just as erudite and funny, even if his later children's books are more dilute. They both like referring to the classics. Bellairs makes fun of the cliches of fantasy even more than in The Face in the Frost (which, when it isn't hilarious, is scary and wondersome - this book has just got the hilarious part). It's not just some mild, watery parody though, it's a really fun story. The author especially likes poking fun at stylistic cliches here. Later on he likes small, precise, somewhat anachronistic details to add absurdity and colour, but he used them here first.

'The spectral shape grew, and it soon presented (to the trained eye) the outline of a 1912 Haynes-Atkinson Structureless Inflatable Biplane.'

It's short, it's very funny, and you want to read it. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J33XYPXLEHKP/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1887726071&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Eleanor Skinner]

The jacket blurb invokes the magical names Borges and Calvino - and for once such superlative comparisons are almost justified. Borges and Calvino probably would have admired the audacious concept of Antoine Bello's dazzling first novel and it will delight lovers of metafiction everywhere. Ostensibly a murder mystery set against the background of the imaginary 'International Speed Puzzle Circuit', its forty-eight 'pieces' (letters, articles, meeting minutes) ultimately form a meditation on the nature of puzzles - both literary and otherwise. You'll probably work out 'whodunit' well before the final pages, but don't worry: that only makes the sadistic climax more chilling. Refreshingly intelligent and wonderfully original, Bello has crafted a novel which is not only capable of endlessly delighting its readers, but one which, through its unusual structure, challenges the notion of that what it means to be part of the genre. (My only reservation is the number of typographical errors in the Serpent's Tail paperback edition.) - http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPHVUPCLP5I4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0156013371&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Steven Reynolds]

*****
If one had to choose only one text by Walter Benjamin that would most nearly encapsulate the totality of his overlapping theories of art, society, politics, literary criticism, and many of the social sciences, one would be hard-pressed to overlook The Arcades Project. For fifteen years, Benjamin trudged over most of Europe like one of Baudelaire's flâneurs, seeking and commenting in his wake, but it was in Paris that he felt especially at home. Benjamin had read Le Paysan de Paris by Louis Aragon and had been entranced enough to reconfigure the city in his imagination in a manner that grew by slow accretion such that even he could not predict the outcome. As one today reads The Arcades Project one is immediately struck by its massive length, which even weighing in at more than a thousand pages is admittedly incomplete. The images that Benjamin limns range from what seems like one phantasmagorical archetype after another: arcades, boulevards, chimneys, shops, in short the daily detritus of quotidian Paris existence all of which seem to hover somewhere between a dream state and semi-alert consciousness. Given the book's meandering nature, it would have been startling had Benjamin actually found a coda to close it. There is currently considerable controversy over what Benjamin expected his readers to make of his book. There is little doubt that his incessant focus on Paris' capitalist underpinning in the generations before his own should be the starting point whereby his readers could view that point either as an entry into the past or an exit from that past into the present. If the former, then the memories and images of the Paris at the time of his writing would converge and overlap with the concomitant images of the prior Paris. If the latter, then his readers would have time-traveled as it were, almost like Twain's Connecticut Yankee, and after having vicariously accompanied Benjamin as flâneur on his lengthy peregrinations, both would emerge in the present with a dream fugue to interpret.

Benjamin re-worded his book in much the same way that Thoreau did with Walden. It took Benjamin more than a decade to write, with each year seeing a new Benjamin entering and exiting a new Paris. He kept up his Sisyphusian task of pushing a mountain-sized peanut, never allowing himself the luxury of regret. Somewhere along the line, he decided to divide the book into some twenty-six "convolutes," or chapters, with each convolute containing clearly delineated objects, some of which were inanimate constructs like chairs and streets. Others were word-collectors like politics and literature; still others were real people, usually writers like his beloved Baudelaire. Whatever a convolute may have contained, Benjamin took that object or construct or author and sought its essential "is-ness" a Kantian sense of identity that could be squeezed into a ball, capturing its essence of that particular now-time, and then gushing it out into his contemporary historical/social milieu. We shall never know how Benjamin might have ended his book, if indeed he even intended an ending. Had he not given into despair at the thought of being handed over to the Gestapo in 1940, he very well might have continued his time trek until his next appointed meeting with his god. And that book would certainly have rivaled Richardson and Proust for sheer length. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EW5TLFFBRZDQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674008022&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Martin Asiner]

*****
Rafael Bernal's The Mongolian Conspiracy, written in 1969, is a masterful work of hilarity and noir. Compelling and full of wit, this is a detective story with a cast of memorable characters, delicious Mexican profanities and sharp, well-placed dialogue. The protagonist, Filiberto García, is an ex–Mexican revolutionary hired by authorities to gather intelligence on a rumored assassination plot on the Mexican and American presidents. García, a "private contractor" with a set of indispensable skills, investigates an underworld that reveals spellbinding truths about corruption close to home. When he begins a relationship with Marta, a young half-Chinese woman he meets along the way, his sense of purpose is only heightened. Not especially common in the world of Mexican noir, the love affair serves as an alluring, and inevitably heartbreaking, backdrop for a classic tale wrought with blood and intrigue. - https://www.amazon.com/review/RSJ31IPBU3HIA/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811220664&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Juan Vidal]

*****
When I was thirteen I was handed a book by a friend. The cover art was off-putting---a red ocean, a mountain in the background with a human heart at its center, the head of a statue in the foreground. I hesitated to accept it, but this friend, who wasn't much of a reader, stared at me for a moment and said, "You've got to." Now, thirty years later, I remember that book more vividly than anything else I have ever read.

The Other Side of the Mountain is narrated by a boy of eighteen who wakes, after a night of drunken revelry, on a ship at sea. Within the first few pages he is nearly drowned by the crew for no other reason than the sport of it. The ship's cook, a crafty old sailor named Toine, takes the boy under his wing and makes him an apprentice.

The ship is soon becalmed and starvation and thirst make the crew insane. A mutiny follows in which the captain is killed and then eaten. When the winds begin to blow again, they bring a typhoon, which sinks the ship. Only the boy and Toine survive, floating on the broken mast in a sea as red as blood. They are washed up onto a strange land and begin to explore it. Here, the story unhinges into the surreal, leading to an ending that is devastating.

Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym is an antecedent to Bernanos's story, but it doesn't approach the latter's power. The writing is so deceptively simple, yet manages to convey great cruelty and horror and always a certain underlying beauty that draws the reader along through the nightmare.

Michel Bernanos, a French writer, spent his early years turning out thrillers under assumed names. Upon nearing his fortieth year, he decided to write something of depth that he would be proud to apply his real name to. He was barely forty when he died, having just completed this masterpiece of 20th century Fantasy. It was published posthumously. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cur0006.htm[Jeffrey Ford]

*****
The Manual of Detection reads like the love-child of Dashiell Hammett and Terry Gilliam. First time novelist Jedediah Berry stirs all the tropes of a hard-boiled detective story with surrealistic fantasy elements to create a delightfully eccentric concoction that goes down easy despite the serious message at its core.

Anyone familiar with the famous quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin,"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety," will probably appreciate the story of Charles Unwin, a fastidious and rule-abiding office clerk, who is unwittingly thrust into a web of intrigue when the celebrated detective he works for goes missing. While investigating the sudden disappearance, Unwin stumbles on a nefarious plot to gain control over the minds of the citizens by infiltrating their dreams. It's the ultimate invasion of privacy and its origins are as surprising as they are sinister. I can't help but wonder if the Patriot Act was high on Berry's mind when the idea for this book was conceived. But despite how dire that sounds, this is hardly a heavy, preachy affair. It's full of quirky humour and unexpected twists, not to mention a host of oddball characters.

Along the way, we meet the cigar-chomping detective Sivart, a pair of [formerly] conjoined twin thugs, an addled museum guard, some very sorry looking elephants, a psychic giantess, an army of sleepwalkers, a villainous ventriloquist, plus three ladies straight out of a classic noir - Emily, the plucky, can-do assistant, Cleo Greenwood, the honey-voiced femme fatale, and the mysterious "woman in the plaid coat." Throw in about ten thousand purloined alarm clocks and a "Travels-no-More" carnival and you've got a story with some seriously weird atmospherics, a unique cast, a bit of mystery and a lot of fun.

This novel is a delight from start to finish. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWY9WHGOBNOK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143116517&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Blake Fraina]

CHICAGO at the turn of the last century is famous for one literary humbug, the man who posed as Oz the Great and Terrible in L. Frank Baum's famous book. Living there at the same time was another humbug, one [Joseph] Benson Bidwell (1835-1912), self-promoter, supposed inventor, and author of two books: a short epistolary fantasy, The Flying Cows of Biloxi, and an autobiography, Benson Bidwell, Inventor of the Trolley Car, Electric Fan and Cold Motor. The latter is one of the most unintentionally funny books I have ever seen, describing events of Bidwell's life on the level of myth and with numerous oddball illustrations captioned "Baby Brother Petting Snake," "He Scalds His Mother's Foot," "Live Indian Roasted on Logheap," "Old Horse Resents Singeing," etc. The prose is similarly heightened. Ah, what Monty Python could do with this tale!

The Flying Cows of Biloxi (similarly illustrated) collects Bidwell's letters to a friend about how, when visiting Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1893, he observed that the cows fed upon Spanish moss, which grows only high up in the trees. So Bidwell invented a way to graft branches of orange trees onto the cows so they could fly up for their feed. The wings have the added advantage of growing oranges! Another great invention for the learned Bidwell!

The truth is another story. A perusal of the Chicago Record-Herald from 1907-09 finds Bidwell arrested and charged with embezzlement. Investors in his cold motor engine claimed that their money was used solely to fund the publication of his two books. Benson was convicted of running a confidence game and sentenced to ten years in prison. His son (and partner) accepted the prison term so his elderly father could remain free. The Flying Cows of Biloxi lives as a curiosity for many reasons. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2005/cur0510.htm[Douglas A. Anderson]

*****
"So, to me, story collections are generally hit or miss creatures. You usually get three or four great stories by three or four great writers, some good stories by some very capable writers, then you get dregs. Story collections by a single writer tend to fare better, provided that said writer is good or great in the first place. Great story collections by great writers are definitely rare enough, but they do exist. That Book Your Mad Ancestor Wrote by K.J. Bishop is one such collection.

If you haven't read K.J. Bishop's novel, The Etched City, and you fancy yourself a fan of Speculative Fiction, well, then you haven't really read the best of Speculative Fiction. I mention The Etched City because, by itself it's an important book, but also, three of the best stories in That Book Your Mad Ancestor Wrote are set in the world of The Etched City, The Art of Dying, The Love of Beauty, and She Mirrors. If you haven't read The Etched City, I actually recommend skipping those three stories, just set them aside, until you've read the novel that they would eventually become. Bishop wrote two of the short stories before her novel, but I think the short stories are better appreciated after reading the masterwork of which they're a part.

While the three above stories are particularly important to me, because The Etched City is so important to me, they're definitely not the only magic that That Book Your Mad Ancestor Wrote has to offer, not by a longshot. There's the dark fairytale of Saving the Gleeful Horse, a story in which childrens' games have deadly consequences in unexpected ways, There's We the Enclosed, a story of searching for something lost that reads like a fever dream. The Heart of a Mouse is a post-apocolyptic nightmare, a story of people suddenly transformed into animals struggling to maintain their human minds, it's kind of The Road meets The Tale of Despereaux meets The Rapture gone terribly wrong. Mother's Curtains is a light-hearted look into the world of the absurd, a story of bedroom curtains that feel unloved, curtains that long to live as the masts of a pirate-ship.

It's hard to really pick a favorite, the entire collection is that strong. Each story has a way of sliding into one's mind, always to be remembered in one way or another. One story that struck me in a very personal way was Between the Covers, a story of a writer who lost her connection with her craft after taking on the Devil as her benefactor. Writers have a certain relationship with their words, their stories, Between the Covers depicts that relationship in a uniquely visual way. Honestly, I'd pay full cover value for that story alone. Tales of writers come to ruin always terrify and fascinate me.

A really neat facet of this collection is that in the closing pages Bishop discusses each story, talking about inspiration, points of symbolism, all those little questions you'd like to ask a writer after you've finished reading their work.

That Book Your Mad Ancestor Wrote is a brilliantly imaginative collection of stories written by an absolutely brilliant writer. K.J. Bishop is someone that doesn't blink into existence every day, her use of craft is something special. She uses words to create life, to create worlds, to create art. K.J. Bishop does things with words that few writers can accomplish. Ultimately, she writes things that are worth reading, which is really all that matters." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHL3FA3ZUDBGPPT6W6XHDEVBEJA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8[Michael Phillips]

*****
"Admirers of Kierkegaard, Sartre and Beckett will enjoy Blanchot's philosophical rumination on existence in the form of this odd novela tragic existential romance of sorts. Thomas and Anne meet at a country hotel and believe themselves to be in love. We learn nothing of their pasts, mutual or personal, or of their plans or hopes. Such superficialities as character development do not concern Blanchot. Instead, the narrative focuses on the neurotic pair's inner worlds, where every slight notion and observation of the outer world carries explicit philosophical implications. The mental processes play unbroken for pages like impassioned and cerebral jazz piano pieces: the ocean is the modern soul, creatures are ideas, cats talk in monologues and the greatest action is a nervous collapse. With this couple, Blanchot examines the extent to which we are separated from our fellow humans by our solipsistic natures. Insight and true high comedy reign throughout these suffering-soaked chapters, remarkably and elegantly translated by Lamberton. For those who dare, this new version of the first novel by the influential French writer, a mystifying and ingenious work, will not soon leave the memory." - https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Obscure-Maurice-Blanchot/dp/0882680765/[Amazon]

*****
This is a baffling and vulgar novel set in a small eastern European town inside what is called the Sinistra zone: a bleak and mountainous outpost governed by a mysterious dictatorship. Or at least, those are the facts I gleaned from this Hungarian novel when I read it several years ago. It’s as bizarre as it is unsettling, and, like the work of another Hungarian great, Krasznahorkai, it’s hard to pin the story down to a certain time. It’s equally difficult to come away with any powerful sense of having learned anything, but the image of the small settlement and the people (as well as the bears) that the outsider protagonist Andrei encounters have endured in my mind with greater clarity than most other books I’ve read. - https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/22/top-10-books-about-strange-towns[Shaun Prescott]

"Move over Aesop ... meet your 21st century reincarnation. Well not exactly - Aesop is more heuristic; Boffa is more satiric. Yes, the vocabulary can be daunting - "sessiliflore oak" isn't a phrase I encounter daily (weekly, monthly or even once a decade or two). But the use of such technical language of biology is extremely well done. When the meaning has to be understood, the context is always sufficient to allow one to understand. When the meaning doesn't need to be undestood, the technical vocabulary serves to keep the reader rooted in the prespective of the current reincarnation of Viskovitz.

The tales themselves use a variety of traditional techniques. Some play on folk sayings - one in love having lost their head is illustrated by a praying mantis. Others play with religious texts - subtle suggestions of God when Viskovitz is a microbe. Others play with cultural sterotypes - the very Buddhist retired narcotics dog that is a junkie himself.

These humorous tales are the best literary "folk tales" that I have read since Ramer's https://www.amazon.com/Bt-Little-Pictures/dp/0345350448/[Bnt-Little Pictures].

*****
"Eunoia means "beautiful thinking" and has the honour of being the shortest word in the English language to have all five vowels. It's an apposite title for Bk's linguistically daring and delightfully inventive work. It begins "Awkward grammar appalls a craftsman", which, as you'll notice, only uses the letter "a". Each of the five chapters performs a similar feat: "Enfettered, these sentences repress free speech"; "Writing is inhibiting"; "Loops on bold fonts now form lots of words for books"; "Kultur spurns Ubu – thus Ubu pulls stunts".

Technically this baroque form is called "univocalics". Bk's work is also a lipogram – the letter "y" never occurs at all – and sets itself other strictures. Each chapter must include foods, drinks, drugs, ships, weapons, meditations on writing and so forth. None of which would be of any interest whatsoever if the result wasn't so engaging, witty and moving. Bk rewrites the Trojan War and riffs on the Arabian Nights; it is, stylistic pyrotechnics aside, a story.

Each letter develops its own character; rambunctious in "u", scherzo in "i". That's why omitting the "y" is so clever, as it would have legitimately introduced other vowel sounds without breaking the self-imposed rules." - https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/book-reviews-eunoia-arioflotga-1-1300566[Stuart Kelly]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
In the 1970s, Kyril Bonfiglioli's Charlie Mortdecai trilogy was published. The good news for us is that it has been republished. Don't Point that Thing at Me is the first in the series. It is a delightful, beautifully written satire. It's not entirely a comedy, though I laughed out loud at least 10 times while reading it. Along with all the laughs, there is a certain air of sadness and even despair that stays with you. Unfortunately, the next two in the series, Something Nasty in the Woodshed and After You With a Pistol are lesser works, but that doesn't mar the quality of this book.

Charlie Mortdecai lives in London, loves his morning tea, his evening cocktails, fine food, impeccable tailoring and all other elements of the life of a man about town. His man, Jock (Strapp, which tells you that there's plenty of low humor here), anticipates Charlie's every need, shimmering into the room out of nowhere whenever Charlie so much as has a glimmer of desire for something. Sounds like Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, doesn't it? Well, not so much. Charlie is a very crooked art dealer---a cheater at everything, in fact, and would never win a Bible knowledge prize. No Bertie Wooster is Charlie. And Jock, though he is at least as much a solver of problems as Jeeves, tends not to use the mind, but rather murder and mayhem as his means.

Charlie and Jock are like Bertie and Jeeves through the looking glass. You may also see hints of George MacDonald Fraser's cowardly anti-hero, Flashman, in Charlie.

The plot of Don't Point That Thing At Me is secondary to the characters and amusing writing. Good thing, too, because the plot can be wildly improbable and somewhat confusing. Let's just say it involves a stolen Goya, the blackmail of a government official, the murder of an American millionaire and a road trip across the US in a painstakingly restored Rolls Royce.

Recommended for fans of Wodehouse, Colin Watson and George MacDonald Fraser. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CARIBFF11QHV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468311638&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Maine Colonial]

*****
There was a period of time a few years back during which I ate up the literature of British exploration like candy - the tragic story of Robert Scott in the Antarctic, the thrilling survival adventures of Sir Ernest Shackleton, and the like. These yarns had in common their Britishness - a bizarre combination of courage and, frankly, foolishness (Scott thought he could get to the South Pole on PONIES and died in pursuit of that belief, accompanied by some people who had never even been south before, while the Norwegian Amundsen sensibly took dogs and experienced skiers and beat him to the destination).

Fortunately the British have a world-class capacity to poke fun at their own foibles, and that is what "Ascent of Rum Doodle" is all about. It parodies a (fictional) expedition to ascend Rum Doodle, a 40,000-foot (!) mountain somewhere near Everest

Expedition Leader Binder narrates his own story. In the spirit of the literature he parodies, our hero Binder never once falters in his belief of the superiority of his crew and the indomitability of the British Spirit. This, despite his crew consisting of a geographer (who is unable to negotiate the London bus system), a doctor (who is always sick), a climber (too overcome by "lassitude" to get out of his sleeping bag), a native cook (so disastrous that the team attempts to leave him behind on the mountain), and a photographer (who does not capture a single shot during the entire expedition.

This hapless crew are babysat by thousands of native porters, who at one point must condescend to actually carry the British crew (fortified by the many crates of medicinal champagne they have burdened the porters with) on their backs.

Did I mention they accidentally climb the wrong mountain??

It's apparently a kind of cult classic among people who actually do this kind of adventuring (not just armchair folk like me), but it's a quick and funny funny read, so even if "frostbite" has not been a factor in your reading choices up to now, you should have a go at this one. A humor classic that should be better known in the U.S. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3HCAKJ5BEHD/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=071266808X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful[bensmomma]

*****
BRITISH author W. E. Bowman published two eccentric spoofs of nonfiction adventure. The Ascent of Rum Doodle (1956) is a stiff-upper-lip mountaineering epic whose deeply incompetent team assails the unconquered 40,0001/2-foot Himalayan peak of the title. Setbacks abound, like the ghastly realization "We had climbed the wrong mountain."

Now that party's leader, Binder, seeks new glory in a voyage that echoes The Kon-Tiki Expedition. "I name this raft Talking Fish.… Heaven help all who sail on her."

The five-man crew's scientific goal is to trace the elusive talking fish of the Pacific. Underwater recordings hint at their language, whose words all sound like "blum-blum." The team's naturalist has already trained a talking frog. His star oyster can distinguish 109 words, but, alas, "The vocal chords of the oyster were rudimentary." Talking fish would be his breakthrough.

To produce a best-selling travel book, one must suffer. Iron rations consist of sawdust and putty. Crewmen eagerly examine themselves for signs of emaciation. One, stuck between timbers and permanently half-immersed, refuses to be released. On a sawdust diet, he begins to grow bark.

Surrealism increases as the crew's pet cats eat radioactive flying fish and go into temporal overdrive. They breed. Their kittens evolve oyster-opening tools, menacing the sapient mollusc. The kittens breed. Exponential growth soon produces untold thousands of mutant cats.

This population bomb deserves a footnote in sf references, between Heinlein's flat cats in The Rolling Stones (1952) and David Gerrold's Star Trek tribbles (1967). Meanwhile, Binder's men remain flummoxed by the intractable philosophical problem of the International Date Line…. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2006/cur0612.htm[David Langford]

*****
The Worldstate of Kallocain appeared in print eight years before Orwell's famous story of totalitarian hell. Although weaker in some ways, it has more emotional impact in many others. It's about Kall, a chemist and loyal Fellow-Soldier of The State. His work re-opens earlier, failed studies on "truth serum" drugs. His new compounds eliminate the earlier drugs' toxic effects, the effect that destroyed the minds of so many human guinea pigs from the Voluntary Sacrificial Service. This time, the more merciful drug simply leaves its victims as passive, even cooperative partners in their own violation - the perverted wish of physical and mental rapists everywhere.

Idealist Kall sees only its potential to help the life-giving state against its enemies, at first. Of course, he sees his invention turned to the self-serving power struggles of the party oligarchs. He sees how having that drug's power corrupts its possessor, even seeing that corruption arise in himself. By then, the evil genie is out of the bottle and granting the wishes of the oppressive State.

The end of the book seems to wander. Kall sees the full force of The State's anti-terrorist army directed against a nameless little band of dreamers. He takes part in vaguely horrific trials for capital crimes against The State, with executions handed down apparently on whims and personal grudges. He ends his story with ambiguous dreams, still hoping that his pharmacological creation can live on, and still hoping (against evidence) that it can be used for genuine good.

It's worth reading, though. It captures the fears of its early Soviet and pre-Nazi era, and captures the time's faith (and fear) in the power of science. And it reminds technologists that, although scientific results have no inherent morality, the people who create and use those results do - or should. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGV41T51I787/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0299038947&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[wiredweird]

*****
"All of the Irish clichs--drink, religion, and more than a touch of blarney--strut their stuff in this satirical first novel that, mindful of the great native literary tradition, tries to amuse as well as dazzle. Set in Killoyle, a place as much obsessed with its growing relations with Europe as it once was with Britain, the story follows the lives of some of the town's finest citizens: Milo Rogers, the waiter and would-be poet; Patrick Murphy, the barman at Spudorgan Hall, the local hotel; Wolfetone Grey, in charge of the hotel's catering; Emmet Power, the hotel manager; Kathy Hickman, columnist for Glam, a women's magazine; Father Doyle, the parish priest; and Thomas ``the Greek'' Maher, a sleazy developer. As to be expected in farce, these lives intersect or connect in lively and improbable ways and, this being an Irish story, the humor is often rather dark. Lives and substance are wasted on alcohol, dreams are more vivid than reality, and real happiness seems at best unlikely. Plot is secondary to character, but there's enough to hold together a narrative obtrusively interrupted by jokey footnotes on almost every page. Among the events: The aging Father Doyle drinks to help him accept that he'll never revisit Rome, where he spent a happy year in his early priesthood; Maher schemes to increase his property holdings; Murphy is fired and becomes a terrorist; Milo is promoted, then begins a typically dilatory Irish courtship of the still lissome Kathy, who once posed for a British porn magazine; Wolfetone, obsessed with a religion whose adherents' names begin with G, goes mad; and Emmet Power and his wife find a pleasant billet running a Jesuit college in Italy. Poor Father Doyle, promised a post in Rome, dies before he can take it up. Despite the often strained humor, Boylan's debut succeeds as a work in which the telling is more important--and more beguiling- -than the tale." - https://www.amazon.com/Killoyle-Irish-Farce-Roger-Boylan/dp/1564781453/[Amazon]

He provides, for example, access into the minds of terrorists, from Irish ultranationalists to Basque separatists, yielding insights you will find nowhere else.

"Crowley, Historical and Hysterical...

Some of the most fascinating moments of this book are the flashbacks to historical reality. Moments from Crowley's actual life are remembered and revised with equal portions of hilarity and plausibility.

Well-known and -documented is Crowley's 1910 visit to Pasadena and the home of the "American Blavatsky," where he was attacked by a pig-faced demon (bearing, in Nick Patterson's illustration, a definite resemblance to Porky Pig). But readers of this novel will be surprised to learn that he was accompanied by Leon Schlesinger, future creator of Looney Tunes. At this time a lowly supplier of title cards to silent movies, Schlesinger, too, is attacked by a bestial demon. In his case, it's a black duck with a slobbering sort of speech impediment. Very "Daffy," this demon.

Also remembered is Crowley's famous enounter in the Algerian Sahara with the terrible demon Choronzon, Guardian of the Abyss. Guess which Looney Tunes character plays that part. Hint: he chews on a carrot, and his "Abyss" is a rabbit hole. Nick Patterson's illustration is equal parts Bugs and hybrid squid-bat-reptile horror!

Tom Bradley displays profound insight into the many esoteric traditions of which Crowley was modernity's past master. He delves into the Great Beast's mind so masterfully that no clearer picture of the man exists outside his own Autohagiography. Elmer Crowley is one strange masterpiece." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLLGMWHOZT2KF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906958556[Montrose]

*****
The Church of Latter-Day Eugenics sure is a wild ride. It's a transformative experience. It's immersive. The story is packed with British slang and humour which could be jarring, if you're not used to it, but not in such a way that it disrupts the flow of the narrative. You've got a sort of gonzo journalist protagonist with little regard for ethics or integrity chasing the story of a kind-of celebrity murder, which leads you through mad methods of deduction and bizarre cult findings. I often found myself taking a moment to reflect on where the story had just taken me. It starts off as a weird murder mystery meets tabloid investigation, and the truth just bends and warps and spirals out of control from there. It's fast paced, comical at times, disturbing at others, and it's over before you know it, and you've wound up some place absolutely completely insane. And I can't wrap my head around how good the dialogue in this book is. Pick it up and let yourself get sucked in. Maybe check that no one has spiked your drink. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LKBEIETYYKWV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl[S.T. Cartledge]

http://www.amazon.com/Wallet-Kai-Lung-Ernest-Bramah-ebook/dp/B0082RZP0S/[Amazon]

*****
'The Wallet of Kai Lung' is a collection of tales told by the itinerant storyteller Kai Lung as he roams the purely fictitious ancient China of British author Ernest Brammah Smith's imagination. Smith published 'The Wallet of Kai Lung' in 1900, after a failed career as a farmer, and went on to write many more Kai Lung stories, as well as other genre fiction that influenced a wide range of authors in the early part of the century. But it is probably for these stories of a China that never was for which he is best known, especially after two later collections were reprinted in the old Ballantine Adult Fantasy imprint edited by Lin Carter.

I suppose they are a particular brand of fantasy - especially with their occasional inclusion of gods and dragons - but it is above all for the dry wit that Bramah infused into their narratives that makes them worth reading. Written as if translated from the Mandarin, the resultant, often tortuous, renderings are full of subtle fun that refuses to call attention to itself, and therein lies much of the charm of Bramah's style. Speaking in a highly refined and polished manner, Kai Lung and the characters he tells of are so cautious of giving offense that the conversations dance and twist around one another until it becomes nearly absurd. No brief example can really do Bramah's style justice, but here is an attempt anyway. At the conclusion of one of Kai Lung's stories, a group of brigands who had been enchanted away from a planned robbery by the storyteller's spell are at first infuriated, but then find out that their plans had been known anyway, and would surely have been caught and hanged if they had carried out the heist:

'At this intimation of the eminent service which Kai Lung had rendered them, the nature of their faces towards him at once changed completely, those who only a moment before had been demanding his death particularly hailing him as their inspired and unobtrusive protector, and in all probability, indeed, a virtuous and benignant spirit in disguise'.

Also scattered throughout the stories are scores of invented proverbs and sayings, my absolute favorite of which is 'Although there exist many thousand subjects for elegant conversation, there are persons who cannot meet a cripple without talking about feet'.

Altogether, 'The Wallet of Kai Lung' is an enjoyable diversion; unfortunately it can also be a bit taxing. Sometimes Bramah's syntax is so convoluted that I had to read it over more than once to get its meaning. By the end of the collection, I was ready to move on to something a little more clear. Still, for its charm and subtlety, I can safely recommend Ernest Bramah to those who appreciate those things, even if it might best broken up into smaller doses instead of read straight through. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B1VNJK5B6CEW/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082RZP0S[Bryan Byrd]

*****
"Kai Lung Beneath the Mulberry Tree is a collection of fantasy stories by English writer Ernest Bramah featuring Kai Lung, an itinerant story-teller of ancient China. It was first published in hardcover in London by The Richards Press Ltd. in February 1940, and was reprinted in 1942, 1944, 1946, and 1951. The first American edition was issued by Arno Press as a volume in its Lost Race and Adult Fantasy Fiction series in 1978.

The title is from Kai Lung's customary venue for telling his stories, sitting on his mat under a mulberry tree.

Although the collection is presented in the fashion of a novel, with each of its component stories designated chapters, there is no overall plot aside from the tales being presented as narratives told by Kai Lung at various points in his itinerant career." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Lung_Beneath_the_Mulberry_Tree[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Lung_Beneath_the_Mulberry_Tree+]

*****
"I'm a big fan of Kai Lung, but this installment disappointed me rather. The pseudo-Chinese is a little too twee, with the puppy-pies and the cute-ified but insufficiently disguised English cliches (the "well-known exclamation of the Emperor Tsing on the battle-field of Shih-ho, 'A sedan-chair! a sedan-chair! This person will unhesitatingly exchange his entire and well-regulated Empire for such an article'"). Kai Lung himself is much less prominent than in other books I liked better, such as his "Golden Hours" and "Unrolling His Mat," merely the storyteller here never a character in an overarching frame story (there is one story he claims to be telling about himself, but it's hardly the real K.L.)--and in the last several stories, he isn't there at all even as the teller, they're just unconnected little vignettes.

So my first reaction was: a much later and lesser work, Bramah really got sloppy after a while. Not so, it turns out: according to Wikipedia, this was the first of the Kai Lung books, and by a good long head start, like 20 years. So it wasn't that Bramah got worse with time, instead he greatly improved. Which I find a happier thought. But even so, this book only gets only a couple stars, where later works in the series are clear fives.

Should also note that Bramah lets some real satire peak through from time to time concerning the literary and publishing world. Enough to be worth mentioning. Enough to make you wonder what sort of experiences he might have had." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCE9FUL4ZDYMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9386780364[Caleb Hanson]

*****
"This book is a real gem of humor. It is the story of a Chinese storyteller named Kai-Lung who wanders through the world, encountering (mis)adventures of his own while also recounting the stories within his repertoire. At times the "story within a story" may seem confusing, but it doesn't really matter. You quickly learn that there's no point in trying to make sense of what's going on.

The author, Ernest Bramah, pokes light-hearted fun at the stereotypical Asian way of speech, which is said to be highly ornate, convoluted, and oblique. While it may seem a bit "Politically Incorrect," I do not detect in Bramah's tone even the slightest hint of disrespect. Moreover, though Bramah at times seems to be inventing ridiculous customs or laws, I've learned that these were factual. Bramah knew and loved China.

To give an example: The first chapter is entitled, "The Malignity of the Depraved Ming-Shu Rears its Offensive Head," Ming-Shu of course being the bad guy. In another place a reference is made to a story that "took place so long ago that it would be impious to doubt anything that happened then." This sort of bent logic crops up throughout the book.

This is a cheerful, upbeat, and silly book that actually contains some kernels of wisdom here and there. I thoroughly enjoyed it." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30U8ZNU9FQJMB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345237870[Baruch]

*****
"The Moon of Much Gladness is a fantasy novel by English writer Ernest Bramah, perhaps told by Kai Lung, Bramah's fictional itinerant story-teller of ancient China. It was first published in hardcover in London by Cassell and Company, Ltd. in May 1932, and was reprinted in 1934. The first American edition was issued by Sheridan House in 1937.

While the fictional narrator of this novel never refers to himself by name, the British first edition is subtitled "A Kai Lung story", and the American edition has the title The Return of Kai Lung.

Unlike the others, it is a true novel rather than a string of short stories. The queue of the mandarin T'sin Wong has mysteriously vanished while he slept. The maiden Hwa-che seeks to solve the mystery, using the methods she has learned from the crime novels of the Western barbarians. In this she is aided by Chin-tung, the mandarin's male secretary. Initially disguised as a man, she and Chin-tung become increasingly attached to each other as the story progresses.

The story humorously spoofs the conventions of the mystery novel, and contains allusions to well known fictional detectives. Readers will catch allusions to Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Hercule Poirot, among others. As with Bramah's other Chinese stories, much of the humor is also derived from a mock "Chinese" re-phrasing of common English expressions." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_of_Much_Gladness[Wikipedia]

Max Carrados is one of the most unusual detectives in all fiction. He is blind - and yet he has developed his other faculties to such an amazing degree that they more than compensate for his lack of sight.'Lose one sense and the others, touch, taste, smell, hearing improve...with a little dedicated training.' Carrados can read a newspaper headline with the touch of his fingers, detect a man wearing a false moustache because 'he carries a five yard aura of spirit gum' and shoot a villain by aiming at the sound of his beating heart. Assisted by his sharp-eyed manservant, Parker, Carrados is the mystery-solver par excellence. Here is a collection of the best of Max Carrados, a set of stories featuring a series of baffling puzzles to challenge the greatest of detectives. They are written by Ernest Bramah with great wit, style and panache.

*****
Brandao's (in)famous book "Zero" follows the vertiginous life of Jose Goncalves, a young Brazilian man. The book's structure is complex, using panels, fragments, and diagrams to express and reflect the chaos of Jose's inner and outer world. Brandao is harrowing in his view of Brazilian government and the infiltration of American consumer culture. But the genius of the book lies in its philosophical implications - where the idea of Being is not presupposed or given as an insipid substratum to the human condition; rather, the concept of multiplicity or difference in identity - moving towards what French philosopher Deleuze would coin as the "aleatory point," the zero in infinity or vice versa - is one of the books central implications. This book transcends the genre of postmodern fiction in its ability to constantly break the rules of linear narrative while, at the same time, cultivate a deeper literary and ontological coherency. At once a scathing critique of society and a burning phenomenology of one mans' experience, Zero is a journey that goes nowhere and thus... arrives at many places. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R38UTPQD65D1NK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564783316&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Owen Ware]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Still-Earth-Brazilian-Literature/dp/1564788717/[Amazon]

*****
Ignácio de Loyola Brandão's "And Still the Earth", originally published in Brazil in 1982 as Não Verás País Nenhum (You Will See No Country), is a dystopia as shocking as the Terry Gilliam movie "Brazil" and George Orwell's classic novel "1984" but more foreseeable than both.

And Still the Earth is an amazing forecast of a Brazil to the extreme, environmental degradation galore, oligarchic capitalism in overdrive. Brandão takes the dominance of the "North" in global markets to its severe logical end-Brazil has sold off the best parts of the Northeast to "multinationals"-Germans, Japanese, British, French, Americans. The Nordestino (northeasterner) natives have been forced to leave their own land, flooding the outskirts of São Paulo and other large cities. To ensure a stable market economy within Brazil, the System requires every citizen to consume a set quota of goods from the weekly government-run market. The failure to do so is punished by fine.

The environmental situation in this future Brazil is also shocking. All of the trees in the Amazon have been cut down, causing an accelerated global warming that ends all rainfall in Brazil for years and creates deadly pockets of heat at ground level that will melt whatever enters them instantly. All the rivers and lakes of Brazil have dried, and waste and pollution from the cities are piped into the ocean. Overpopulation causes the System to enforce sterility and restrict the buses and the neighborhoods in which one can travel, and automobiles are outlawed. Migrants unable to make it into the cities are held at bay in encampments where they face the grueling sun and toxic pollution and produce offspring without limbs, hair or skin. Even the relatively better off city-dwellers with apartments suffer from new forms of cancer, birth defects, and deformities. Citizens must carry their identity cards with them at all times so that the civil guard can make sure they are staying within their designated pedestrian and residential zones. The government (also known as "the System") constantly pumps propaganda about government-produced goods and the coming "Marquee" which will cover the sky and protect Brazilians from the scorching sun.

Amid this setting in São Paulo, we find our protagonist, Souza, a fifty year-old history professor who loses his post because he reveals too much of the pre-System past to his students. He leads a life of habit and monotony that manages to persist despite increasing scarcity of food and water, restriction on freedom of travel, and the suppression of all news critical of the government. Souza recognizes the desperation of the situation, but trudges on until one day he notices an itching in the palm of one of his hands. He scratches and scratches until eventually the irritation becomes a hole that goes straight through the hand. His wife Adelaide, who has adapted with even less protest to the System's controls, tells him to have it checked by the doctor. But Souza hides it, fearful of being sent away in isolation and skeptical that the state-run medical system would actually offer a viable cure in this world of mutants and deformities.

In Brandão's future Brazil, governments symbolically rise and fall, but a small minority upper class advances protected by the military in gated communities with swimming pools, abundant food, and water, isolated from the suffering masses who go for days without food and value water more than gold. This is a must read for anyone interested in science fiction, the dangers of totalitarianism or the future of the world. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CF2GQVNQQ76Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564788717&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[C.

*****
Briggs is an acknowledged political commentator, widely applauded for his pictorial treatise against the futility of nuclear war in his opus 'When the wind blows'. However, few in academia have taken it upon themselves to delve into the political and sociological intricacy of this, one of his earlier, and without doubt most subversive works. Indeed, here he ponders the futility of existence itself.

Briggs drills down to the core of what it means to be Bogey, the great joy and comfort that manifests in the soft cloying darkness of despair; and in so doing Briggs slowly reveals to the reader the murky fears lurking in the gloomy depths of their own subconcious. There is Bogey in all of us, lest we forget; scrubbing vigourously (both physically and metaphorically) to remove the grime of nature and replace it with manufactured odours designed to disguise and decieve both our olfactory senses and our concious sensibilities. Briggs tome signposts the enlightened truth to all those who would see it.
The structure of Bogeydom is clearly an allegorical metaphor for our own society. The stark difference being only that the dark foreboding heart of Bogeydom is laid bare and open for all on the page, whereas in our worlds it is camoflaged beneath a facade of the superficial ; a veneer of clean civility layered on that inky black foundation that we so clearly share with the Bogey.

The politics of Bogeydom are Nietzschian in formulation, derived in part from the confusion between good and bad and the blurring of the age-old dichotomy so that no longer are they polar opposites, but exist as an entwined entity of undefined moral code on a multi-dimensional continuum. Like all things in Bogeydom the politics too are muddy. Fungus ponders his place and his role, and at times the reader is tantalised with the expectation that they are witnessing an empathetic iconoclast about to forge his own destiny, but ultimately Fungus is resigned to his lot, a thinker not a doer. The nihillistic qualities of the Bogey, both moral and existential, and of Fungus in particular by way of his internal dialogue, are presented in an alluring pathos that can only guide the the reader moth-like to conclude that perhaps it is ultimately possible to mentally transcend the complications and impositions of modern society if only we used less soap. - http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R2FN75QPI2JG5/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141342692[Weasel powered cheese maker]

*****
The movie documentary "Stone Reader" is about great books that have been lost to public memory or somehow never gotten the attention they deserve. My nomination for a "great lost book" is Brock Brower's "The Late Great Creature", an amazing 1971 novel that needs to be resurrected for a certain-to-be large, appreciative audience. The title character is Simon Moro, the greatest horror movie star of the 1920's and '30's (he's like Lon Chaney Sr. to the nth degree.) We learn of his fall from fame, and his attempted comeback in the phantasmagorical year of 1968. In his prime he made "Ghoulgantua", the most terrifying film ever made (about a combination Frankenstein's monster/vampire.) He created the famous monster "Gila Man" (a sort of werewolf lizard) during the war. Later he was blacklisted for political reasons, went to Germany to make a legendary, unreleased horror movie about the Nazi concentration camps that was supressed by both West and East Germany, and gradually sank into obscurity. Then low-budget Hollywood came calling with an offer to make a cheap Roger Corman-style Edgar Allen Poe rip-off titled "Raven!"

The novel has an amazing storytelling virtuosity that suggests, as one critic put it, a younger Nabokov raised on creepy old horror movies. There are three narrators: Warner Williams, a terminally-slick magazine writer who provides the basic back story of Moro's amazing career. There's also Terry Cowan, the amoral, cynical director of "Raven!" And there's Moro himself, who drops some pretty big surprises in his narration that make you question all that has gone before. Like Bela Lugosi, Moro struggled with demons (including drugs and poverty) but Moro developed some real heroism and hard-won insight. As he says, "Where there is no spine, there is no tingle." He looks out at the corrupt America of the 1960's and decides to shock it back to its moral senses by scaring the country to death during the publicity tour for his new movie. He does this in grotesque, hilarious ways that you have to read for yourself.

The book is wonderfully satrical about celebrity culture and is also a loving tribute to the horror genre. It's stunningly verbally agile. There are lines that will stick in your head forever. It's also got a thrillingly intricate plot, that as you unravel it through the three narrators, will amaze and delight you. In a way it reminds me of Michael Chabon's "Wonder Boys" in its compassionate yet blisteringly funny and painstakingly accurate portrait of artistic losers run amok. I read this in high school and it remains one of my very favorite books. You should get hold of a copy immediately, any way you can. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MMLIIA0RQL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590206886&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[R.

*****
"THIS IS an ironic, comic, macabre, basically savage attack on modern man," proclaims the front of the dust jacket for Smallcreep's Day, and for once, they're not lying. It's a bitter, didactic, bracing novel.

The titular and symbolically named Pinquean Smallcreep is a factory worker who, after sixteen years in the same slotting section of a nameless factory, decides to venture deep into its Gormenghastian confines to find out what it produces. On his journey he meets no end of strange characters blithely going about their business despite the ominous, surreal landscapes around them, from men being "drowned" in an unchecked flow of money to a poleman boating on a vast underground lake of sewage.

Near the end of his journey, Smallcreep runs into a managing director who offers a wholesale indictment of mankind. "We should eventually become necrophiles together, and walk hand in hand through charnel houses and execution chambers, or write marriage vows on parchment made of human skins, or copulate in burial pits by the light of pyres."

Smallcreep eventually sees the machine the factory produces in action. It does not make him any happier.

Musician Mike Rutherford (of Genesis fame) released a concept album based on the novel. The music is good but he gave the story a happy ending, rendering it a rather aggressive exercise in point-missing.

Though evidently still alive, Brown does not seem to have published any subsequent fiction. Smallcreep's Day said all he had to say. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2009/cur0902.htm[Lawrence Person]

Why Browne decided to compress the whole of human learning on the subject of formal and ancient gardens into 60 pages of dense convoluted syntax, I do not know. The late WG Sebald once told me that not even he could decipher all its sentences. But this strange tract stands as a monument to an age's fascination with the cultivation of the fruits of the earth.

*****
The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered, is a discourse written by Sir Thomas Browne. It was first published in 1658, in conjunction with its diptych companion, Urn-Burial. In modern times it has been recognised as Browne's major literary contribution to Hermetic wisdom.

...

With its near vertiginous procession of visual imagery, objects, botanical observations and mystical analogies, along with its constant reinforcement of how God geometrizes (via the symbols of the number five and quincunx pattern), all developed from hastily jotted notes in a fractured, breathless, style, The Garden of Cyrus is an exceptional and highly idiosyncratic literary work. A critical examination of draught manuscripts of the Discourse reveals that the extraordinary variety of examples taken from art and nature were written with uncharacteristic haste; as if the physician-philosopher were sometimes recollecting evidence of the quincunx pattern faster than his pen could write.

...

Paragraphs of The Garden of Cyrus may be considered as early examples of stream of consciousness writing, which, speculated as the product of altered consciousness,[1] are not dissimilar to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, the science fiction of H. G. Wells or the Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky, in expression of a highly unusual perspective upon life and reality.

There are however, two major reasons why The Garden of Cyrus is not as well known as its diptych companion, Urn-Burial. Firstly, the sheer difficulty of the text itself, which has baffled all but the most determined readers, for stylistically the discourse alternates between notebook jottings to passages of sublime purple prose. It also alludes to what is now considered to be obscure learning, namely Hermeticism and the esoteric in general.

The second reason for The Garden of Cyrus being little-known is due to an editorial and publishing trend, totally against Browne's artistic intentions, of it being omitted from many nineteenth and twentieth century editions, reproducing Urn-Burial alone. Even modern editions from reputable literary scholars and publishers such as New York Review Books [2] continue to perpetuate this misrepresentation of Browne's paradoxical cosmic vision.[3]

Though difficult to read, The Garden of Cyrus remains an important work of English literature, primarily because it is incontrovertible evidence that as late as the mid-seventeenth century, isolated individuals throughout Europe continued to subscribe to the tenets of Hermetic philosophy. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Cyrus[Wikipedia]

"That's the job of the magical Traveler, to use his magic to end magic. That underlying paradox provides the premise of this connected set of short stories. He travels the world at intervals, surveying the realm of unreason on each trip, and taking satisfaction in watching it shrink. Where he can, he applies his subtle magic in support of Reason's expanding domain.

Brunner explores Chaos's control and degradation of humankind in several of its ways. The first story tweaks mindless religion. It might even show how one can choose atheism, after encountering a god face to face and finding him unworthy of belief. Another of these gentle stories undermines magical thinking - again, not because it fails, but because its success is not worth having. And so with the faith in luck that makes Las Vegas the holy city of Chance, and so the unwarranted sense of entitlement that demands ever-richer result for ever-poorer effort at earning it, and so for blind pursuit of power irrespective of the cost or of who pays it. Since these stories are built around layers of paradox, Brunner's mechanism is itself a paradox, the smallest of magics to achieve the largest of consequences.

Brunner was one of the best SF writers of the 70s and 80s, author of "Shockwave Rider" and other stories of chilling prescience. Among all of his writings, though, "Traveler in Black" may be his finest and most under-stated, under-rated achievements. These stories have held up well over the thirty years since they were written; since they pass in a distant place and age, there is little in them that can look dated. I recommend these stories to any thinking reader." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PCLVV6873EZY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441822118[wiredweird]

*****
This book was a maudlin, violent, disgusting, grotesque, and hilarious trek across Medieval Europe in the company of two of the most odious saints to ever consider themselves the blessed of the queen of heaven. The grave robbers of the title do unspeakable, horrific acts and even a few good deeds according to their own, particular moral code that is constantly, and hilariously hammered out in discussion between the twins. They smite demons, make deals with witches, murder children, and aid their fellow man as they see fit to judge them meritorious, living moment-to-moment on their journey from Germany, through Italy, and into Egypt. ("Gyptland" as they call it.)

Beyond just the brothers, they encounter all sorts of comically individual characters, each with their own particular moral codes that get hashed out along the way as the constant moral debate of the scoundrels picks up or abandons, celebrates or condemns, blesses or murders all the people along the way. One thing is certain, the Brothers Grossbart are anti-heroes of the blackest sort, and as long as they are in a book where one need not actually smell them, wildly charismatic.

I recommend this book to fans of Rowan Atkinson's "Black Adder" character in particular, and perhaps fans of Monty Python's "Quest for the Holy Grail". - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AJYPWR8TO1SQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl[Joe]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Death-Jesse-Bullington/dp/0316087343/[Amazon]

*****
Though not as gory as The Sad Tale Of the Brothers Grossbart, The Enterprise of Death is no less...meaty. Meaty in that there are a lot of themes to chew on, figuratively speaking. Slavery in the late medieval period, European-Moorish relations, the Black Plague and Inquisition, as well as the lesbian perspective in said era. Meaty too, in that necromancy, witchery and even cannibalism serve a large steaming portion of the story as well. Jesse Bullington, where he succeeds in delivering a pure, linear havoc in Bros. Grossbart, changes pace by delivering a more measured and thoughtful sojourn from the view of the quintessential medieval outcast. Peppered, it must be said, with mangled corpses aplenty.

What Bullington does really well is his portrayal of the lower classed every-witch in their milieu. Awa, Moorish slave to human and necromancer alike is an interesting lead protagonist. Her tale is more of survival than it contains full hero quality or development. Her learned skills in necromancy are portrayed more as a curse than an actual benefit, which gives the stereotype of witchery a refreshing take. Awa is quiet and demure, even when raising the dead at her bidding; however, there's not much depth to her character other than being determined to resolve her life or death dilemma, coerced by her devious tutor.

With what Awa lacks in depth the supporting characters deliver, as Bullington conjures a curious group of comrades surrounding Awa. The artist and reluctant mercenary Manuel symbolizes the of plight of the starving artist forced to kill for his coal sketches. The giantess Monique, who wants nothing more than to manage her own clean and upstanding brothel, however dirty her own desires may be. And the mercurial Dr. Paracelsus, ever seeking to understand and develop scientific thought, is cleverly exposed in earning his title as the Devil's Doctor. It an odd assemblage but one that gives quite a lot of detail, humor, and food for thought of the medieval era.

The Enterprise of Death is an interesting commentary on whether it is better, or perhaps just more fun, to struggle with life or succumb to that of the undead. The story is a fun romp across medieval Europe, concerning itself with issues still faced today like witch-hunts, war and disease, finding love, and whether cooked human really tastes like pork. It's an engaging and smart story. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MUA91QT6MX0Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl[gonzobrarian]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
This is the third novel by Jesse Bullington. I doubt he will ever be heralded as a great writer but he could easily become a cult one, on the strenght of a formula that is just about as weird as it sounds. Think historical fiction mixed with pulp. Think a gory concoction of (gay) sex, liberal doses of graphic violence and a bibliography (sic!) that mentions treatises on medieval denominations and crossbows, just to name a few. Think, in short, about the unholy union of Tarantino's and Rabelais' talents (btw: it was the Guardian who came up with this comparison, as the cover blurb dutifully reports).

"The Folly of the World" takes place in XVth-century Holland, shortly after the infamous "Saint Elizabeth Flood", which basically annihilated tens of villages, forever altering the landscape. In such circumstances, which made beggars of thousands of peasants and nobles alike (not to mention the casualties), one can find opportunities, provided he's ruthless and unscrupled enough. The trio of conspirators which are at the centre of the novel most certainly are: a con man, a killer on the verge of madness and a savage girl who swims like a fish. The trio join efforts in the attempt of recovering a lost fortune but then something goes horribly wrong and...the tale spins forward.

Set against the backdrop of scheming nobles, corrupt militiamen and the desperate populace, "The Folly of the World" is a guilty pleasure starring completely amoral characters who will kill, bribe and otherwise bully their way through life's adventures. Full in equal parts of coarse language (the f*** word is freely dispensed) and over-the-top turns of events, the novel shouldn't be filed under the generic "genre fiction" label as it brims with a wittiness and a sophistication that is more closely associated with higher literature (that...and the fact that Bullington evidently did some serious research previous to writing).

Sinply put, Bulligton is a genre unto itself: fantasy fiction without sword&sorcery bulls***, a language which is both vulgar and stylized and action-packed plots that are both well-researched and pulp-ish. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHELXXJKU1QVL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl[Simone Oltolina]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Swastika-Night-Katharine-Burdekin/dp/0935312560/[Amazon]

*****
"Swastika Night" was published in 1937, although the fact that "Murray Constantine" was a pseudonym for Katharine Burdekin was not revealed until the early 1980s (Burdekin died in 1963). The chief interest in this dystopian novel was that Burdekin was telling the story of a feudal Europe that existed seven centuries into a world in which Hitler and the Nazi achieved total victory. The novel begins with a "knight" entering "the Holy Hitler chapel," where the faithful all sing the praise of "God the Thunderer" and: "His Son our Holy Adolf Hitler, the Only Man. Who was, not begotten, not born of a woman, but Exploded!" With such a beginning it is hard not to look at "Swastika Night" as a nightmarish version of the Germany and England that would result from a Nazi victory. Given the time in which she was writing, two years before Hitler's forces invaded Poland and officially began the Second World War, it is equally obvious that Burdekin is simultaneously an indictment of Hitler's political and militaristic policies and a warning of the logical consequences of the Nazi ideology.
Burdekin depicts a world that has been divided into the Nazi Empire (Europe and Africa) and the equally militaristic Japanese Empire (Asia, Australia, and the Americas), a demarcation that raises some interesting issues all by itself. Obviously in the Nazi Empire Hitler is venerated as a god and all books and documents from the past have been destroyed so that the Nazi version of history is all that remains (the similarity is more to the efforts of the ancient Egytpian pharoahs than Orwell's idea of the continuous revision of the public record). With all of the Jews having been exterminated at the start of the Nazi era, it is now Christians who are the reviled object of Nazi persecution, as well as those who are "Not Blood." Burdekin's protagonist is an Englishman named Alfred (suggesting parallels to England's legendary king Alfred the Great), who rejects the violence, brutality, and militarism of Nazi ideology because it results not in boys rather than men.
However, the fact that Hitler lost World War II does not mean that "Swastika Night" does not speak to contemporary readers in an important way. After all, we have not been progressing towards the dystopian vision of George Orwell and "Nineteen Eighty-Four" is still the mos widely read dystopian novel around. Burdekin's novel also explores the connection between gender and political power. Part of Hitler's deification is because he was never contaminated by contact with women, and In contrast to the "cult of masculinity," Burdekin depicts a "Reduction of Women" in which all women are kept ignorant and apathetic, their own function being for purposes of breeding. She clearly say the male apotheosis of women as mothers as being the first step on the slippery slope to the degradation of women to mere breeding animals. Despite the obvious comparisons to "Nineteen Eighty-Four," it is the contrast between the womanless world of "Swastika Night" and the woman-centered utopia of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "Herland" (or even Virginia Woolf's "Three Guinesas," published in 1938) that most students of utopian literature are going to want to pursue.
Once World War II began "Swastika Night" became a historical footnote, especially since its pacifism would have been considered an impractical response to Hitler once war was declared. But today the feminist arguments regarding hypertrophied masculinity and the correlating reduction of women that are as much a part of the work as the condemnation of Nazi ideology makes it well worth consideration by contemporary readers. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RV8CUUTRB5T/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0935312560&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lawrance Bernabo]

*The Wanting Seed* (1962)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Wanting-Seed-Norton-Paperback-Fiction/dp/0393315088/[Amazon]

*****
Burgess journeys into the dystopian world with one of the most breath-taking tales of its genre. As others have remarked, it sits alongside Brave New World, 1984 and other class-leaders (to which list I would add Bradbury's Farenheit 451) - though there is some debate whether it scores as highly as these others. I would assert that it does, largely because of the way in which Burgess introduces concepts not explored elsewhere which are at the very least topical / satirical, but also in parts of vital global importance.

The first of this is the over-population issue itself. Liberalised and even stringent enforcement measures are failing. The populace (as portrayed metaphorically by Beatrice-Joanna) is indifferent, impassive and ultimately self-absorbed, when it comes to family and procreation. The ethical challenge is barely considered as personal desire, love, devotion, wins out over moral responsibility. Keenly observed and hugely important as an observation on the human condition.

Secondly, how the population control is managed through war is chillingly introduced, and arguably Tristam's experiences in the army are the most vividly depicted [so much so in fact that I sensed a definite bridge between this and the earlier parts of the book, as if they had been two separate concepts woven together later] anywhere in the novel. And consider how authoritarian states use foreign conflict (or any conflict) as a necessary part of policy; consider then 'foreign conflicts' in recent times "for the good of the nation" that were little more than vote-winning exercises. You can see how the two ideas were drawn together, and as global populations continue to increase, control through warfare becomes a macabre but all-too-plausible notion. Who would bet against it.

The third image is the food shortage issue, which is stomach-churningly resolved through cannibalistic dining clubs. Disturbing, but again, highly believable. But more than this the provision of the rationed food, and the global blight that causes the food supply shortage, is excellently introduced and, as a piece of satirical commentary, explored a problem of over-farming and the rape of the world's natural resources that is all-too-relevant today. A forerunner of ecological and environmental anxiety.

Spanning this is a very simple story about 3 very different individuals trapped in this dark future, whose lives and loves are almost all-consuming, and whose behaviour is - surely - shaped both by their environment and, in a couple of a cases, their self-loathing. Their three-way relationship and Tristram's journey of emotion in response to this is - on its own - a great story.

How this is brought to the page uses Burgess' playful and notorious exacting standards of vocabulary. This is rewarding and frustrating to the average reader, and yet fits in well with a futurescape which is anything but mundane, and warrants colour and sharp focus. The style is also, perhaps consciously, well removed from the Orwellian straight-forward and accessible style. Somehow the hugely popular and readily comprehensible 1984 feels like a mass-market triumph of dystopian literature, whereas Burgess (I think admittedly) never set out, or set aside the time, to achieve such ground-breaking success. The fact that I personally find The Wanting Seed more intriguing and rewarding is probably because he attempts to pack more cocnepts that challenge accepted wisdom. For me this puts it on a par with the other dystopian greats. 5 stars without a shadown of a doubt. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FKO3KFQPHL75/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393315088[degs]

*****
...

Taking Alberto Moravia’s comment about the extraordinary nature of Belli’s work in contrast to his Romantic contemporaries and literalizing it to spectacular effect, Burgess folds his own translations of 71 of Belli’s sonnets inside an ingenious fictional account in which the author invents a brief meeting in Rome in 1821 between Belli, the most realist of early 19th century poets, who finds “God in cabbage patches and beer-stains on a tavern table,” and English Romantic John Keats – that poet of “nature, romance, fairyland, heartache, the classical world as seen in a rainy English garden.” Though the imagined encounter takes place quickly – a collision of poetic souls beneath Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel frescoes that provokes questions concerning the purpose and practice of art and poetry – the repercussions reach far.

ABBA ABBA derives its resonant title from three sources: the rhyme scheme of the initial octave of the Petrarchan sonnet form; Christ’s last words on the cross (“Father, father” or “Abba, Abba” in Aramaic); and Burgess’ own initials (the words in fact appear on Burgess’ tomb). Burgess weaves all three significances into his novel, most obviously by including Belli’s sonnets and a couple by Keats, but also by presenting a moving portrait of Keats dying of consumption while living above Rome’s Spanish Steps and, finally, by a self-reflexive and fiendishly clever Nabokovian coda (readers are cautioned to note that what appears to be an appendix actually carries the title: “Two”).

In ABBA ABBA Burgess revels in language, playing Keats’ ethereal lyricism against the street smart linguistic wantonness of Belli’s Romanesco, and both against mortality. The degree to which Burgess celebrates language is clear from his freely dragging in other impressive linguistic displays - from Shakespeare to Robert Burton’s The Anatomy of Melancholy to the sermons of Jeremy Taylor – in order to supplement the lyrical conversations and feverish monologues he invents for the dying Keats and the tart, incisive repartee he summons for Belli. He even has Keats make an awkward effort to translate a notorious sonnet by Belli containing myriad Romanesco slang words for penis (“What would the Edinburgh Review say of this? Would Leigh Hunt print it in the Examiner and go to jail again on behalf of Free Speech?”), while on Belli’s side Burgess places a coy appreciation of Keats’ famous sonnet on Mrs. Reynolds’ cat, perhaps the closest the English poet ever came to Belli’s insistence that the sonnet be brought “low,” dethroned from its “Petrarchan coronation.” Nor does Burgess stop with English; a few sample lines of Carlo Porta’s translation of Dante into Milanese dialect make it into the novel, as does an evident relish on Burgess’ part in revealing attributes in English poetry that derive from Italian and/or dialect - for example, having Keats discover, via John Florio’s first Italian-English dictionary, A Worlde of Wordes, a clue to Shakespeare’s own dialect: “and now it flashed on him where the joke was in Falstaff’s words: ‘reasons are as plentiful as blackberries.’ Of course: raisins.” The second part of the novel takes the form of an afterward, offering a brief biography of and essay on Belli that, like Clark’s, underscores the strikingly original, lively, vernacular quality of Belli’s work and stressing his kinship with Gogol and influence on Joyce’s Ulysses. The translations – selected entirely from Belli’s religiously-themed sonnets – follow the brief, clever coda to which I’ve alluded above. The result of this short, ingenious and audacious exercise (a mere 85 pages excepting the sonnets) is a tour-de-force, a rapturous example of the literary novel about literature and a terrific feat of conjuring, via imagination, Moravia’s observation.

[[Sky_Saw]]
*Sky Saw* (2012)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Sky-Saw-Blake-Butler/dp/0985023503/[Amazon]

*****
Readers who know anything of Blake Butler will already know that he literally doesn't sleep. Instead he writes and he writes with an insomniac fury. He launched onto the scene in 2009 with the all-too-brief darkly distopic Scorch Atlas. That same year he produced, Ever, a slightly less successful novella. In 2011 he hit us with the utterly brilliant There Is No Year: A Novel and the bizarre self-portrait Nothing: A Portrait of Insomnia. 2012 saw the release of the strange little tome executed with Sean Kilpatrick, Anatomy Courses and what is arguably, along with There Is No Year, his tour de force thus far: Sky Saw. Alongside this outpouring he has also maintained one of the most interesting alt literary sites on-line: HTML Giant. As mentioned, the man doesn't sleep.

Atlas, No Year and Sky Saw read almost as a linked trilogy depicting a world of madness that rivals anything that William S. Burroughs ever penned. No Year garnered comparisons with Ben Marcus' brilliant The Father Costume (the books appeared within a year of each other) with Marcus proclaiming: "Blake Butler, mastermind and visionary, has sneaked up and drugged the American novel. What stumbles awake in the aftermath is feral and awesome in its power, a fairy tale of an ordinary family subjected to the strange, lonesome agony known as daily life. There Is No Year is a merciless novel cleansed of joy, pumped full of fear and awe."

Indeed, if that's your kind of thing, Sky Saw takes it a few damn steps further. Just prior to Sky Saw, I finished reading Extreme Metaphors, the collected interviews with J.G. Ballard. It seems all too easy to forget what a searing impact JGB made with both Atrocity Exhibition and Crash. Throughout, Ballard makes reference to his admiration for the ground-breaking approach also taken by William S. Burroughs, who also, of course, shattered a few boundaries. But then literature in general seemed to slink back into a safe hole a la the likes of Tom Wolfe and Jonathan Franzen. But during the last decade there seems to be a resurgence of experimentation with such writers as Grace Krilanovich, Steve Erickson, Matthew Derby, Brian Evenson, Brian Conn, Matt Derby, Ryan Boudinot, Joshua Cohen and Mark Z. Danielewski, amongst others pushing the envelope.

Like Butler's previous book, There Is No Year, Sky Saw is essentially narrative in structure but veers strongly into new waters via both pure language mutation and a powerful sense of visceral Surrealism. I'll digress for the moment and recall the works of a number of precedents; Lautreamont's Maldoror, Djuna Barnes' Nightwood, Lawrence Durrell's The Black Book, Bataille, Cocteau, Giorgio de Chirico's Hebdomeros, Henry Miller, M. Ageyev's Novel With Cocaine, Sacher-Masoch, Strindberg's, Inferno / From an Occult Diary to attempt to give this book a safe(ish) nest or context.

There was one point in Sky Saw where I couldn't help think of a zombie orgy: "...he saw among the heavy glow how all the space was stuffed with sleeping people, their mottled bodies packed in naked, flesh to flesh conformed and still conforming. Many of them had no faces. Many others had no heads. Even those that did seemed to blur where they were built, their features changing in floods of color and old mud." And elsewhere: "bodies full of sick sound noise and vomit, aching blistered, bumpy, long. The sludge was full of men and they were full of sludge."

And then there are the parasitical horrors: "The men burst men each from their seams, leaking others of them from the holes they carried."

The numerization of individuals - especially the central characters; the father Person 811 and the mother 1180 - whilst perhaps not the most original concept, remains chilling. One recalls Kafka and Orwell, especially in the sense of there being a totalitarian bureaucracy behind the scenes: "in his memory the state said to have erected around each and every neat locale, and were claimed to have caught the brunt of the crap and cancers and what all else some god had dreamed to wear their lives--the state's voice the only clear one through and through him, ordering his veins,"

In all, a terrifying book. A nightmare that rings of horrific truth. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBQNCDLP39UC/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985023503&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ashley Crawford]

*****
I'm overjoyed that Banner Books has released a new edition of Jack Butler's "Jujitsu for Christ." This is a modern classic that, while successful when first published in1986, never gained the widespread popularity and critical acclaim it deserved. It should forever be on shelves next to "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Faulkner's "Sanctuary" and other classics of Southern literature. No other author has succeeded in picturing the Deep South of the 1960s with such truth, understanding, compassion and outrageous humor. The damp heat of Mississippi in the summertime seeps into the reader's bones along with the racial tension of the time.

Roger Wing, a scrawny, misfit, born-again white boy, opens a martial arts studio in a segregated black neighborhood in Jackson, Mississippi and is taken in as a stray by the Gandy family -- a large and diverse black family. From Little Wide Load to Mosey Froghead, "Jujitsu for Christ" is peopled with inventive and lovable characters, none of whom shines more brightly than Roger. To top it all off, Roger's introduction to sex is one of the funniest and sexiest love scenes ever written.

There is no gimmicky trick ending, but there is a surprise in the end and the surprise is the discovery of just who the heck is telling this story. This book is a jewel. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R12M62KLDJNI2M/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B08XD00&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text[alec clayton]

[[Mobile]]
*Mobile* (1963)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-French-Literature-Michel-Butor/dp/156478343X/[Amazon]

*****
I couldn't help but notice that there were no reviews, not even professional ones, of this book, and it's too good not to have some description available here. I first read Mobile in the sixties, in French, and in spite of a failing memory for the language, re-read it recently. (I'm ordering this translation, too, curious to see how it reads in English) Written in the era of Rauschenberg and Pop collage, the book is a pastiche, alternating between short, dry notes seemingly made as the writer travels across America, and excerpts, sometimes fascinating, sometimes damning, always revealing, from our own documents. Audubon's diaries, Sears catalogs, treaties with Indian tribes, billboards, all kinds of quotations are included to create a portrait of the country. Butor seems to be arguing that only thereby can a likeness be created that is true to our nature. Mo-BEEL, or mobile: fragmentary, disjointed, contradictory, hypnotic, always on the move.

This wry inventory, although (as is true of all books that quote pop culture) somewhat dated, deserves to be more widely known here. We Americans are notoriously self-involved; ever since deToqueville we have been fascinated not only with questions of our own identity but the way foreigners see us, and Butor fulfills that promise with a fascinating interpretation, not sociology but art. His entries definitely stack the deck--the 60s counterculture flourished in France as well as the U.S., after all-- but this is no easy hatchet job. The author seems as fascinated by American excesses, lapses and foibles as he is judgmental. Forget Baudrillard: this is much more engaging. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NLDFYAUSKW5E/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156478343X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bartolo]

*The Tartar Steppe* (2005)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Tartar-Steppe-Buzzati-Stuart-Clink/dp/1567923046/[Amazon]

*****
Well, I've finished The Tartar Steppe, and it's really an excellent book. I'm glad I discovered it. It's melancholy throughout most of the book, and it may be best suited to a reader around my age, over 40, but younger readers can certainly get a lot out of it too... heck maybe it can even be a wake up call to some. It's very much a book about time, and the cruelty of the passage of time, lost opportunities, squandered moments and squandered years. It's a medium-short book, and a quick read, yet it manages to give the impression of immensity of space and events and long stretches of time.

It also manages to be suspenseful and mysterious, and the tone of mystery is sustained effectively throughout. Hence, I won't spoil the narrative, but will confine myself to describing tone, style, impression.

As far as the style, tone, I continued to think about it relative to the works of some other authors I admire. Its similarity to Kafka includes the heavy anxiety and the arbitrary swings between hopefullness and despair... it has a lot of reversals, reversals of mood, reversals of the interpretation of events... in that way, it's certainly like Kafka. It's more obsessive and committed to following a single theme than most of Kafka's works, and it's less absurd, but still has it's degree of absurdity, especially as expressed by the the absurd decisions and opinions expressed by the higher command of the army.

Relative to Celine, it's pessimistic, but not nearly as pessimistic as Celine, and more sentimental. Celine's pessimism is brutal and uncompromising, Buzzati's is more muted, but still full of dread, and contrasted by the sentimentalism of youth and age. Honestly, though, I imagine Celine would himself have rejected Buzzati as wishy-washy... it's impossible to say for sure... but I resisted judging it that way, and let myself be sentimental and go along with the author's intent.

I think it was the end of Chapter Six which cured me of my reservations and skepticism, and made me really feel what the author was after. This is quite early in the thirty chapter book. In it, Buzzati metaphorically describes the passage of life from youthful ambition to the disillusionment of the elders.

Meanwhile, the opportunities for noble action are rare, ellusive, and easily lost if not acted on immediately. Words which are contemplated but go unspoken also undermine our hope for a noble, significant life. There's an almost mystical commitment to the idea that, if only the right words had been spoken at the right time, just a moment earlier before some sudden turn of events, things would have turned out quite differently for everyone. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BYWZCWRFCNHH/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567923046[Paul J.

*Auto-da-Fe* (1935)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Auto-da-Fe-Elias-Canetti/dp/0374518793/[Amazon]

*****
The history of Canetti's odd, inventive novel provides clues to its understanding. According to his memoirs, Canetti originally conceived the "Human Comedy of Madmen," a fictional cycle portraying eight characters. Of these, only one character lived on in his imagination: Brand the Book Man. Inspired by Gogol, modeled after Stendhal's "The Red and the Black," and informed by Jacob Burckhardt's "History of Greek Civilization," Canetti's surviving portrait is an allegorical odyssey of a recluse who lives only for his books.

Yet those already familiar with "Auto da Fe" know that there is no character named Brand in the book. During the year (1930-31) that Canetti finished his novel, he changed the main character's name from Brand [German for conflagration] to Kant and the novel's title to "Kant Catches Fire." Canetti explains in the second volume of his memoirs that the lingering emotions he felt from his presence when a mob burned down Vienna's Palace of Justice in 1927 made this new title "hard to endure." And so "Kant became Kien [German for resinous pinewood]; the ignitability of the world, a threat that I felt, was maintained in the name of the chief character." Likewise, he changed the title to Die Blendung [The Blinding], a reference to the biblical legend of Samson. It was under this title that the book was published in 1935, but it was soon banned by the Nazis.

The main character is a leading Sinologist whose meticulous scholarship and linguistic expertise make him famous among an elite group, but Kien's lack of social skills ultimately defines him: he refuses to be part of the crowd (the dynamics of which is one of Canetti's real-life intellectual preoccupations). Kien's 25,000-volume library overtakes his entire apartment, the 40,000 characters of the Chinese alphabet challenge his intellect, and his only human relationships are daily contacts with a housekeeper of eight years and morning ventures to the bookshops that dot the city of Vienna. His cloistered life is shattered, however, when he decides to marry the housekeeper; her conniving greed is eventually wedded to the brute force of the building's superintendent, a retired police officer whose nascent fascism finds full expression in his treatment of Kien. Eventually, Kien conflates his fear and hatred of his wife with the misogyny he has learned from his vast readings.

Simultaneously bizarre and uncomplicated, the story reads like a 450-page Homeric epic filtered through the psychoses of the Brothers Grimm. Expelled from his book-dominated oasis, Kien descends into the underworld of Vienna, a journey that results in the destruction of the world as he knows it. Dwarfs, prostitutes, blind men--each of the major and minor characters develops his or her own perspective of the events through which they live; when their internally consistent yet outwardly incongruent worlds clash, the results alternate between absurdity and madness. What it is all supposed to mean will engage the patient reader's imagination for weeks. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XJWFL6DRC98H/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374518793&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[D.

[[RUR]]
*Rossum's Universal Robots (RUR)* (1920)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/R-U-R-Rossums-Universal-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141182083/[Amazon]

*****
The ultimate problem in Karel Capek's extraordinary play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) is that the robots created by humanity's journeymen imitated humanity so abominably well.

Written in 1920 and first produced in 1921 RUR opened to critical worldwide acclaim. Although RUR is best remembered for introducing the word robot into the lexicon (the word was coined by Karel's brother and some time collaborator Josef Capek) it is more a somber reflection on humanity than on the emergence of robots.

The play opens on an unnamed island at some point in time after 1920 where lifelike robots are being produced by Rossum's Universal Robots. The officers of the corporation meet a young lady, Helena, who has come to the island on behalf of the League of Humanity, determined to help liberate these robots from the inhumane working conditions that confront them. The executives fill Helena in on the history of the company, particularly the father-son team of Rossums that developed the first robots. Capek makes it a point to describe the difference between the father and the son. The father was a "scientific materialist" whose desire to create an imitation of man grew out of his wish to prove that God was unnecessary. The son thought this was both silly and inefficient and sought nothing more than to produce robots capable of working non-stop.

Each of the following scenes takes place at some unspecified point in the future. The millions of robots produced take on all the industrial and agricultural work performed formerly by men and women. This leads to unintended consequences. First, the lack of necessity (the need to work) in everyday life leads to a few worker revolts. This causes various governments to arm the robots to quell the resulting riots. Further, these governments decide that all future wars will be fought by robots. As one might imagine, a well-trained robot-militia is not conducive to the future health and welfare of the human race. Second, the lack of work and the general lack of purposefulness of life render humans incapable of reproducing.

As the play nears its end, the robots have united and have set out to destroy the human race. Clearly, the robots have learned to think for themselves and as such they have taken on (or evolved into) something that more closely resembles the human race. The fact that the robots behave so abominably does not belie this similarity to their human creators. The problem the robots face is that they do not have the inherent capacity to reproduce (they have a shelf-life a bit shorter than is average for humans) and they have inadvertently destroyed those humans that know how to create more robots. They are faced with extinction just as surely as the humans they have destroyed.

As the play concludes the sole remaining human, Alquist, spots two robots whose clear affection for each other indicates that the robots are about find a means to reproduce without the assistance of the humans who gave them life. This pleases Alquist no end and as the play ends, he `anoints' the robots with his blessing. It is a poignant, jumbled mixture of the creation story (and on the sixth day) and the Song of Simeon (Let us now thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.) The rich irony in this biblical blessing of the new, robotic Adam and Eve brings us to a place dramatically different from the elder Rossum's stated desire to create robots to disprove the existence of God. Alquist's benediction shows man at the height of his humanity and speaks directly to Alduous Huxley's dictum that "the humanity of men and women is inversely proportional to their numbers."

R.U.R. was written at a time when the world was still reeling from the horrors of the First World War, which horrors were magnified by technological advancements that made the killing industry far more efficient than it ever had been in the past. Capek's pessimism must be viewed through that prism. However, it must be noted that Èapek's pessimism was not directed at technology itself. I think his concern was with the unchanging human nature of those who think they control the technology and who direct, for good or ill, its use. In some respects this harkens to the political slogan that "guns don't kill people, people kills people". In this instance and in view of the horrors Capek witnessed first hand, it does not seem inappropriate.

It should be noted that R.U.R. was written 85 years ago and the words Capek wrote were meant to be heard by an audience and not read.. As such, some of the dialogue will sound a bit stilted or dated to the reader. However this bit of apparent aging should not diminish the enjoyment to be derived from reading R.U.R. R.U.R. and Capek' other great dystopian work, War With the Newts are a must read for those interested in some of the early 20th century's most compelling fictional looks into the heart of darkness that is mankind. The introduction by Ivan Klima, a biographer of Capek is noteworthy and adds a great deal of illumination for the reader. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39H8VAHHNACPW/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141182083[Lonya]

*****
"This is one hell of a fantasy adventure tale with plenty of beautifully crude humor, sex,
and mind-altering substances. On the flip side, it is also intelligent. There are strong
philosophical elements, soul searching and the quest for answers to life's big questions. The
combination of all of these elements worked very well together. I was grabbed immediately by
the humor and weirdness, but happy to stay for the richness and originality of what followed.
John dreams of a voice commanding him to walk 500 miles and to now refer to himself as John
the Revelator. He awakes in a cave with no idea where he is or who he used to be. He is instructed
to "polish the rod with aromatic balms and oils," the first of many scenes involving the unique use
of bodily fluids. His journey then begins. Leaving the cave, he hears an out of tune guitar being
played by a man named Santiago. Santiago speaks in riddles, odd sayings and song lyrics. This
is very irritating to John, who very quickly tires of the man, but needs him as a guide. They are off
to a rough start from the beginning. Santiago is one my my all time favorite characters and the
narrator in the audiobook does a great job portraying him.

John and Santiago must follow El Camino de la Muerte or the "Red Brick Road" until reaching
the villain Android Lovethorn. John must then force Lovethorn to send him back to his previous
life, which will not be an easy task. The voice of the burning bush feeds 'John bits and pieces of
information about the person he used to be and why he must redeem himself in this other world
along the way.

In all, this book was very easy to love. The characters and the surroundings they encounter are
oddly unique. Their often vulgar names and characteristics are sure to stick with me for a long
time. One last thought, If there really are beings called blumpkins I think I would go for a one night
stand or two if anyone knows where to get one." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14V3OKLZG9AIG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982280041[Rodney Gardner]

*The Lost Steps* (1953)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
Probably the most remarkable literary event of the 20th century was the explosion--no other word will suffice--of Latin American literary creativity, fully comparable to a similar explosion in the US in the 19th century. And one of the most remarkable creators of this explosion is Alejo Carpentier. Reasonable people may differ regarding who is the greatest Latin American novelist, but surely Carpentier must be ranked among them, and "The Lost Steps" is his most widely read work.

The plot of "The Lost Steps" can be summarized very simply. The narrator, a naturalized American citizen living in New York City, once had youthful ambitions to become a composer. However, he now finds himself earning a living doing musical hack work, e.g., jingles for TV commercials. He is married and also has a mistress. When the novel opens, he has not had any work commissioned in a while and is starting to feel desperate. A friend who is a museum curator offers him the opportunity to go to an unnamed South American country to find a rare musical instrument. The narrator cynically sees this as an opportunity to have an expenses-paid trip with his mistress, but as the trip progresses he feels his dormant musical creativity being revived. He eventually finds the instrument he is looking for. He also meets a primitive, illiterate, mixed-race young woman by whom he is initially repulsed but with whom he eventually falls in love and cohabits with. His mistress leaves him and goes back home. He ends up living with his mistress in a small, inaccessible village deep in the jungle; the only other inhabitants are a native tribe and a few merchants of European descent. He believes that he has now found true happiness, away from the corruption and decadence of modern civilization. He forgets all about his obligations to the museum that sponsored his trip and vows never to go back.

One day his idyllic bliss is shattered when a helicopter lands and he learns that his "disappearance" has become front page news in the US. His wife and his museum sponsors have sent a search party to look for him. He realizes that he has no choice but to go back, although he desperately wants to stay. He promises his native lover that he will be back as soon as he can. When he gets back home, he discovers that he has become a celebrity, at least for a while, but he is miserably unhappy. His pregnant wife files for divorce, and the newspaper that sponsored his rescue now regards him as a traitor and deceiver and portrays him in the most negative light possible. His sources of income dwindle. He is reunited with his mistress but is repulsed by her and wants desperately to return to the village.Nearly a year passes before he is able to attempt to get back to the remote village. Getting there involves a water passage, and he finds to his horror that the rains that have fallen in recent months have caused the water level to rise to the point that the river covers the steps that were his marker for the jungle path to the village. He has no way to return to the village! Shortly thereafter he learns from someone who occasionally visits the village that his primitive lover has married someone else in the village. He is devastated. He suddenly realizes that he was never accepted by the people of the village or by his lover, that he was always regarded as an outsider who was only there temporarily and would never stay. Reluctantly, he decides to return to New York, realizing that he has no other choice.

This simple synopsis does not to justice to the richness of this novel. Even in translation, the richness of Carpentier's prose comes through: his fluency with words, his mastery of sentence structure, his mastery of metaphor and allegory. This is a novel of immense erudition, replete with literary and musical references. One of the novels messages, I think, is to enjoy and savor the peak experiences of life when you can, because they won't last and they won't come back again. Another message is that perfect happiness is unattainable and that most humans need to be content with what they are able to attain. In short, this is a work of incomparable richness that I can recommend unreservedly. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20DD2OSYLCGVG/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816638071[William J.

I've read a lot of really good books recently, but even then this one stands out. Like Corman McCarthy with a few more hints of humanity; earthy surrealism; and lots of sword fights. (For real.) I saw Carr read part of this book live and it just blew me away. Despite the violence, it's also a profound meditation on the relationship between ideas and reality--between the way things are and the way it seems they ought to be, and what life is like when it approaches what Hobbes called the "state of nature". This book takes place in a sort of desert wasteland like something from an absurdist play, outside all society, without past or future (like the old West except plus stoplights)... except instead of contemplating the futility of existence the characters are all fighting each other to death. In the end it left me feeling sort of hollow but considering all the violence I suppose that's the point. There are a few things that could have been improved but in all the ways that count this book is basically top notch. (Also, this won't make sense to anyone who hasn't read the book, but it has the best passage about mothers, bad breath, and long arms ever written.) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CYO1JBDLVJQX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl[Kyle Muntz]

The Hearing Trumpet is deliciously funny and irreverent; Surrealist painter/author Leonora Carrington's apocalyptic tale is filled with gems such as "Darling, don't be philosophical, it doesn't suit you, it makes your nose red." Filtered through the eyes and ears of Marian Leatherby, a 92 year-old inmate of a Spanish old folk's home (run by the cultlike Well of Light Brotherhood), the tongue-in-cheek tone and hilarious chracters make this book a refreshing surprise. Every copy I've ever owned has been stolen! From the first paragraph, the reader will see that Marian Leatherby and her friends are NOT LOL's (Little Old Ladies), and Leonora Carrington is not your average author. (She's truly hilarious, for one!)

ON CHRISTMAS Eve, eight-year-old Davy drowses by the fireplace reading Lewis Carroll's classic novel. He is suddenly accosted by a kaleidoscopic Goblin who transforms the family's Dutch clock into a boat, transporting Davy to a weird land inhabited by storybook figures including Robinson Crusoe, Robin Hood (and his daughter Little Red Riding), Sindbad and his Roc, and Sham-Sham: the last of the Forty Thieves, who stirs a simmering cauldron filled with pocket-watches (although a watched pot never boils). Davy also encounters the Hole-Keeper (a two-dimensional sentinel who ties knots in holes) plus a whale in a waistcoat, the grotesque Cockalorum, and the notorious Butterscotchmen. After bizarre adventures, Davy is gently awakened by his grandmother and the friendly aromas of dinner.

Davy and the Goblin frankly imitates the Alice books, yet Carryl is nearly the equal of Carroll in his use of wordplay and corkscrewed logic. Davy includes several long poems of nonsense verse that are impressively Carrollian, including one nautical poem that has been widely anthologized, which begins "A capital ship for an ocean trip was the Walloping Window-Blind."

Charles Edward Carryl (1841–1920) was a millionaire who held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for thirty-four years, but found time for occasional contributions to the children's magazine St. Nicholas, in which Davy was serialized. He dedicated this fantasy novel to his son Guy Wetmore Carryl (1873 – 1904), who went on to write some superb nonsense verse of his own. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2006/cur0607.htm[F.

*Nights at the Circus* (1986)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140077030/[Amazon]

*****
The beginning of Nights at the Circus is filled with descriptions that question the identities of the characters rather than offer clear descriptions of them. The characters transform themselves, but not in the typical way that fiction creates characters through an explained process of development; but rather, it is one of mutation. The character's presentation of themselves is an act of subterfuge. All the narrative voices that are encountered assert their position as authoritative and dominant in a way that seeks to undermine all the rest, but remains questionable. As Lorna Sage writes in her examination of narrative voices in Nights at the Circus, All of these voices are generously endowed with the kind of dubious plausibility that comes from the suspicion that they are making it up as they go along, just like the author, so that the reader is often treated to the uncanny feeling that he or she is being addressed from behind masks by characters who know they are on stage. It is in the hands of the questionable narrators that the author has placed us as an act of subversion to point out that, while the characters are fictional constructs, they are also entitled to a kind of creative freedom in the identity they choose to present to the reader. This is a technique that blurs the character's identities to create a space of historical disharmony. If the reader is to believe that the characters have an actual past, it is one that we will never feel entirely secure about. It is implied in this that the past is created out of a single personal perspective, one that is largely based on imagination, rather than a line of uncontestable facts. This narrative technique pushes the reader into the chair of an audience member. The spectacle that ensues frames a number of questions about the construction of identity. Is identity solid or fluid? Are the assumptions made about the character's identities formed from a personal perspective or that of an observer? Rather than offer answers to these questions, the narrative of the characters offer a sense of being that is constantly maintained within the present and not subject to a sense of inevitability based on history.

Biographical facts are distorted through a voyeuristic presence upon a character's identity. When Walser comes to interview Fevvers he is more ambitious about dismantling and destroying the identity that is presented to him than trying to understand it. This is a condition of his journalistic ambition, but it is also an act of misogyny to align Fevvers to his own image of what a woman (or a proper bird) should be. Considering her actions in the rest of the narrative, it appears that her ability to transform what people believe to be her identity is what saves her from the many attempts to destroy her sense of being (both physically and mentally). Her vibrant character and profession as a performer enables her to dodge any idea that she is only what the external perspective perceives her as. Through her ability to constantly maintain a performance, the reader and other characters that view her are forced to question their sense of her identity. Through this she is able to maintain an unstifled sense of identity because it is one based upon transformation and elusiveness. Walser deliberates on her motives of presenting herself in the way she does: he (Walser) was astonished to discover that it was the limitations of her act in themselves that made him briefly contemplate the unimaginable - that is, the absolute suspension of disbelief. For, in order to earn a living, might not a genuine bird-woman - in the implausible event that such a thing existed - have to pretend she was an artificial one? He smiled to himself at the paradox: in a secular age, an authentic miracle must purport to be a hoax, in order to gain credit in the world. The distinction between what is genuine and what is false is invalid if a perception of another is made with total acceptance. The reason why Fevvers encounters so many hardships is that people cannot suspend their disbelief. However, the question of whether she really is a bird-woman is suspended in favor of the idea that an unconditional perception of another is what should be made rather than asking a plethora of unanswerable questions about another's identity. If this is the standpoint the reader maintains while reading Fevvers' account of her life, then emotional involvement will take precedence over any logical objections. Any secure sense of being can only be made if there is a certain amount of faith. Fevvers' sense of her own identity is large enough to undo any grounding perception others may have of her and this is why she is able to fly.

The communities in Nights at the Circus are counterpoints to the closed, highly formed communities found in novels like To the Lighthouse and the stories of Katherine Mansfield. They allow identity to be individually created rather than socially arranged. The identities always remain in control and under the ownership of the characters themselves. This technique of writing resists any attempt to marginalise the character's position in their social environments because they create identities outside of a hierarchy scheme. Rather, the characters inhabit a fantasy zone composed of mobile symbols intended to poke fun at and undermine the ideas they represent. Nights at the Circus is never allowed to submit to any particular ideological scheme, but point to dreams which are the hinder side of thought's boundaries. It is a novel not intended to platform any particular ideology like feminism (a common belief of this novel), but champion a general philosophical outlook that can undermine conventional moralistic and limited systems of belief. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14E4C74KY31HE/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140077030[Eric Anderson]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Infernal-Desire-Machines-Doctor-Hoffman/dp/0140235191/[Amazon]

*****
This is one of Angela Carter's wildest and best novels, a verbal feast served up by the late writer's seemingly inexhaustible imagination. Erotic, picaresque, complex, surreal, and humorous only begin to describe the pleasures contained herein. The story revolves around Desiderio, who as a young man sets out to assassinate Dr. Hoffman, a genius waging war against an unnamed city by means of hallucinations or dreams produced with the "eroto-energy" of 50 copulating couples in his Wagnerian mountain castle. In his very Swiftian travels, Desiderio encounters a deserted seaside town, is arrested for a murder he didn't commit, and escapes with a bullet wound; is taken in by the river people with their strange, seductive ways who eventually try to sacrifice him; escapes again to sojourn with a traveling circus where he is raped by nine Moroccan acrobats who later fall off a cliff with the rest of the circus and a town of puritans (imagine that conflict); meets a megalomaniacal Count whose travels take him and Desiderio to Africa where the Count is boiled in a pot by a cannibal chieftain; spends time in a curious, religiously rigid culture of centaurs (Carter's most obvious homage to Swift). The novel is a satire of sexual mores, restrictions, fetishes, and hang-ups that only a writer as gutsy and opulently talented as Angela Carter could have attempted. As a work of art, it's all over the place, and you might not enjoy it unless you let it take you along for the ride. It makes a very suitable companion to her later, more disciplined novel, The Passion of New Eve. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25ET8WP2ZK4B0/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140235191[Andrew Rasanen]

*****
Adolfo Bioy Casares recipe for magical realism could apply to the works of Kafka and Borges (Casares' friend and sometime collaborator ) as well as to his own: "For fantastic stories to be persuasive and convince the reader, they must be very realistic in the narration." In his introduction, James Sallis suggests that as people go about their lives, "fantastic events occur above their heads, in the next room, in the corners of bureau drawers." The intersection of the fantastic and the quotidian is not so much a shock as a leakage. "Always there is in Bioy's work," observes Sallis, "this sense of other worlds all about us, worlds that, to plunge into our own, require only a small opening, a sliphole."

In Asleep in the Sun, Lucio Bordenave experiences that leakage. His chronically unhappy wife, Diana, is further distressed when Lucio loses his job at the bank. Her mental health slips until she is anxious to enter a sanitarium which seems to combine elements of mental institution and pet hospital. Lucio desperately misses his choleric mate although his misery is challenged by the attentions first of his wife's lookalike sister and later by his neighbor's wife. When Diana finally returns, she is far more agreeable than previously. Lucio likes her better this way but is unsure if he loves her. As the sliphole into the fantastic leads in ever stranger directions, Lucio must decide if his dog, also named Diana, has become the true host of his wife's spirit. In trying to solve this problem, Lucio bravely enters the sanitarium and asks indelicate questions. It is at this point, the novel becomes ever more harrowing and the path back to "reality" more difficult to discern.

As with Kafka, Borges and Marquez, Bioy utilizes the fantastic to delineate the real. A Day in the Sun is a love story that explores the nature of connection and of identity. It also functions as political parable and cerebral adventure story.

Lucio's stolid nature, as well as his love for his wife, is his greatest asset as he enters this strange world lying so close to our own. Critic Thomas Beltzer says of Bioy's narrators: "The strangeness is not just in the observed but in the observer." Part of Bioy's art is to encourage the reader/observer to test the line between real and fantastic while experiencing the book. If the observer can accept and move through the small opening with the author, he will find Asleep in the Sun a rewarding fable. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RBTR4W3EZ6SY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590170954&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[The Ginger Man]

*****
In order to fully understand and appreciate Dolly City, it is helpful to first read Castel-Bloom's more traditionally structured and written Human Parts. With Human Parts as a reading guide, Dolly City becomes a bit more intelligible for the reader unready for Castel-Bloom's flights of surreal fancy. Castel-Bloom is fixated with the sense of insecurity in the lives of individual people in the State of Israel, and Dolly City is the extreme, deranged expression of this. Nothing is taken for granted in Dolly City, both the novel and the fictitious city of the same name. Anything can happen at any time, and the characters are both unprepared for a response, have the wrong response, no response at all, or overreact to life's demands. So this work can be a jarring novel to read: there is an inescapable sense of dread on each page, of infinite possibility, and as if live itself is not a given anymore, but derangement heading straight to death. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R32KSG2B9Z9W9X/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564786102&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Eric Maroney]

[[London_Bridge]]
*London Bridge* (1965, 1995)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/London-Bridge-French-Literature-Louis-Ferdinand/dp/1564780716/[Amazon]

*****
'London Bridge' continues the misadventures of Ferdinard, anti-hero of 'Guignol's Band' and altar-ego of Celine. Exiled in the London underworld during the Great War, having served at the front and been decorated for bravery, a shellshocked Ferdinand, shrapnel in his brain, prone to fits and blackouts and a gammy left arm, on the run after the violent death of an associate, has hooked up with Sosthene de Rodiencourt, an aging Orientalist mystic. To finance a trip to Tibet, both have offered their services to a wealthy baronet, Colonel O'Collogham, who is testing military gas-masks in the hope of landing a lucrative contract. While Sosthene and O'Collogham test the masks, rattling the large house with bombs and chemicals, Ferdinand attempts to resist the lure of his host's angelic, underage, skimpily-dressed ward, Virginia, whom the Colonel humiliates by whipping in front of the servants. Terrorised by paranoia (that both the police and his old cronies are after him), a trip into the city for supplies sees Ferdinand confronted with unwelcome shades from the past.

The exhausting, febrile, exclamatory style of 'Bridge' takes its cue from its two protagonists, the mentally disoriented Ferdinand and the rythmically possessed Sostehme, with his epileptic Eastern dances. Comprising a handful of extended set-pieces, Celine doesn't so much describe the action so much as circle around it like a deranged vulture, skirting it with an excess of repetition, obscenity and slang. Ferdinand's 'reportage', coloured by paranoia, hallucination, spasms, fantasy, desire, dream, rage, confession, frustration, guilt, fear and shellshock is further disoriented by the skittish rhythms of his partner, whose possessed, frenzied dances imitate cod-Oriental texts. Many of the teeming set-pieces reveolve around literal dances - the acrobatic choreography of a ghost in a pulsing nightclub; the attempts by Sosthene to stop traffic in Picadilly with a ritualistic dance - and the style mimics their wild, jerking, swaying movements. The novel's coup-de-grace is an astonishing 100 page parody of Proust's 'Time Regained', using the same subject matter - Zeppelin air-raids, a phantasmagoric social occasion in which the hero meets figures from his past; the disorienting mix of aristocracy and criminality - but grinding it through a snarling demotic, brutal lowlife energy and slapstick violence, culminating in the arrival of a four months-long decomposing corpse.

This misanthropic catalogue of degraded and violent, if vibrant, human interaction finds room for some of the most vivid, hyperbolic and poetic descriptions of (a re-imagined) London in literature, with its labyrinthine back-streets, infernal hideouts and hangouts, and the teeming, larger-than-life activity of its ports, just as England's imperial glory is coming to an end.

The compulsive present-tense immediacy of the narrative is occasionally broken off by reminders of the narrator's vantage-point in the hell of World War 2, with the full knowledge of civilisation's embrace of the abyss. This twisted nostalgia, complete with incredulous winkings with the reader, mixed with Shakespeare, fairy tale and the Arabian Nights, illuminates the violence and grime with a genuine enchantment.

The full flavour of Celine's complex, neologistic verbal onslaught can never be caught in English, but translator Dominic di Bernardi comes closest yet, capturing rhythm, pace and the sheer overabundance or words, and is a vast improvement on the existing version of 'Guignol's Band' (any chance of having a go at that now, Mr. di Bernardi?) - http://www.amazon.com/review/R37N9WN81LCMHL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564780716&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[darragh o'odonoghue]

[[Moravagine]]
*Moravagine* (1983)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0785930442/[Amazon]

*****
As one commentator has said, this disturbing book, with its two anarchist lead characters, is Cendrars' view of the artistic process, viewed from the destructive perspective; to recall Michael Bakunin (1814-76), "The passion for destruction is also a constructive passion," a famous utterance which is like a watermark behind everything which occurs in _Moravagine_.

There is no fun or point in giving away the picaresque plot of this extraordinary work. I have no idea how this reads in the original french, but the english translation by Alan Brown (Penguin) is clear and compelling. Apart from the disease imagery, present from the first to the last, there are many luxuriant images and, on the whole, an intensity which retains power even when people today have read or seen so much about terrorists and murderers. As the narrator and Moravagine make their way across continents, the pace flags, notably in the Blue Indians section, but Cendrars' vision, and the slow, inexorable unwinding of the narrator's previous self-confidence and enormous conceits become more interesting than Moravagine's own nature. Anticipating postmodernist writers, Cendrars includes a snapshot (a fake one, to be sure) of himself as a minor character whose path crosses the two killers.

A convert to Cendrars, having just finished _Moravagine_, would best follow it with the Dan Yack books (_Dan Yack_; _Confessions of Dan Yack_), and then the uneven but exhilirating tetralogy comprising _The Astonished Man_, _Planus_, _Lice_ and _Sky_. If one can forget Nina Rootes' interference with Cendrars' own presentation of his material, then these hard to obtain books (most out of print) are well worth reading. An excellent critic on Cendrars (and more respectful translator) is Monique Chefdor.

Blaise Cendrars is a neglected Modernist who does not make a big enough blip on english radar, partly because he was not affiliated with any political group or -isms. He rarely receives extensive mention in anthologies or reviews of french letters written in english. His daughter, Miriam, has published a biography which is at present only in french. University libraries are the most reliable places to find a good selection of his works. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GABJS7V3B2OO/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785930442[Jeff Bursey]

*The King in Yellow* (1895)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/King-Yellow-Robert-W-Chambers/dp/1623750792/">Amazon</A>

*****
Robert W. Chambers' "The King in Yellow" is a book within a book. Or, more properly, it's a collection of macabre short stories with a common theme; a fictional two-act play that brings decadence, hallucinations, and madness to any reader.

The stories within this collection, published in 1895, are set in a fictional militaristic 1920s in both the USA and Europe. The tales stand free of each other, and are told from a number of different perspectives, by socialites, soldiers, and artists. Each tells how the lives of the narrator and colleagues have been affected by reading "The King in Yellow", a controversial play that has been denounced by the church and suppressed by governments. After coming into contact with it, their lives are tragically affected. Some find themselves hounded by shadowy agents, while others become confused and delusional. Others are driven to act out the play's sad and decadent events, while some simply go insane.

The substance of the play itself is only alluded to, or hinted at in brief extracts. It is clearly a tragedy, but the motivations and actions of its central characters, including the mysterious King in Yellow himself, are not clear. Like many authors of macabre tales, Chambers was content for our imaginations to do the work, and this book is more powerful for it.

(And by the way, if the central theme of a forbidden book that induces insanity is familiar to you, you've probably read some of the Mythos tales of H.P.Lovecraft. In fact, I doubt that too many people come to read "The King in Yellow" by any other route; Chambers' book is clearly stated as a strong influence on Lovecraft's work.)

To be honest, I was shocked to find myself reading a book that was over a HUNDRED years old, an activity I had assumed was reserved for crusty academics and lovers of classical literature. But, more pointedly, I was surprised to find that "The King in Yellow" is a highly readable volume, full of entertaining, colourful and disturbing tales with a very modern feel to them.

The only downside I found was that the final few stories lose the central theme. I found myself wondering if these thinner, romantic tales, were more representative of Chambers' other work, and were, in effect, "fillers". But perhaps I missed the point? It is only this that stops me from awarding five stars to this impressive book.

Overall, if you've had a bellyful of today's crop of relentless gore and explicit sexuality, take a literary Alka Seltzer by checking out the "King in Yellow".

It's a classic, and I'm not talking Jane Austen. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AT37RDXXU4I4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623750792&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[john.kilby@cableol.co.uk]

We find ourselves in a Russia that is more a state of mind than a place. A composite, the area of our psyche that we have assembled to signify "Russia" based on what facts, images or tidbits we may have been able to gather concerning this nation through it's literature, culture, history, people, songs, paintings, photographs. Yes, ...vodka, cold, waiting, a broken violin. It's what exists within us of a place we've never been to, all preconceptions still intact, all inhabitants actions assuringly predictable. But Chapman plays with our Russia, tweaking it only slightly at times but at other times absurdly distorting it. How little we really understand, how great is the distance, how laughable our expectations, in ways reminiscent of Kafka's Amerika.

In this collaged world we're introduced to a man who is equally a collage. Stet the filmmaker is an amalgamation of the noblest attributes of every artist we've ever admired. Those who exist beyond the realm of our own inadequacies, those never held back by silly things like uncertainty or fear, those who obstinately proceed without considering the damaging effects to their own stability or comfort, those with ideals, those beyond temptation, those whose life and art seem beautifully intertwined. Innocent, adaptive, inwardly driven. What will happen to this man here? How will he survive?

But we can't admire him from afar as we have our other artistic lodestars. We are with him as he loses everything, his work, his girl, his space (in intervals), his freedom, his health, his sleep, his sustenance, his life. Would he really never flinch? Could he really still amuse himself? "Stet, back in his cell, finds there is nothing here to interfere with his work, he begins directing a film only he can see. In the dark he turns barbed wire into rivers." Could such an imperturbable man really exist?

Or can it be that Chapman means to show us a parallel? That this man exists as much or as little as this place exists, and that though both exist to some degree, neither are as steadfast as we've made them in our minds.

I love James Chapman's Stet. It is complex and beautiful. The painting on the cover depicts a man appearing to reach out his hand to hold the hand of an unreceptive executioner. I wonder if the man isn't Stet and the executioner not Stet's idealism which will consume his soul, lead to his ruin and give him nothing in return. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11PA1KF3UX8IX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl[David F.

*****
Let me start with a warning: this is a difficult book to read. You can't skim it or read without your full attention like you can with -- well, with almost everything. The characters switch bodies (or think they do), they're unreliable narrators whose perceptions may not match reality, they contradict themselves, there are flashbacks and dream sequences galore. Only well into the book is it possible to even get any idea of what's going on. As confusing as The Troika can be, it is very much worth the effort. Trust is required here. You're on a drive, but someone else is at the wheel. Slide into the moment, enjoy the view and stop worrying so much about where you're going. You *are* going somewhere, but the trip itself is the best part of the experience. There are stories and images in The Troika that will stay with me for a long, long time. There are passages in the book that are as beautiful and carefully sculpted as anything I've ever read: the line of girls with their tongues frozen to the parking meters; skating upside down along the bottom of the ice; the fish-headed sacrifice who escapes moments before her heart is cut out. I was reminded of Dick, Kafka and others, but Chapman's voice is unique and original, and he clearly has a love of language and words. The Troika was one of the strangest books I've ever read, and among the best I've come across in several years. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JV9245368UQT/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EW468I[Andrew S.]

*****
Gary Trudeau conducting a tour of Ronald Reagan's brain. J. G. Ballard flensing a drowned giant. Isaac Asimov orchestrating a fantastic bloodstream voyage. James Morrow towing the corpse of Jehovah.

What do all these expeditions--through cellular landscapes entered via shrinking or across enlarged physiognamies encountered as geography--have in common? Surely Jonathan Swift's accounts of Gulliver's Lilliputian and Brobdingnangian exploits figure somewhere in the literary morphic fields of these works. But a closer ancestor, one more likely to have been encountered by authors of a certain age, is George Chappell's Through the Alimentary Canal with Gun and Camera, a profanely comic and bodily disrespectful tour through the helpless interior of an anonymous citizen.

Presented as the first-person scientific account of an unnamed explorer and his three companions, Through the Alimentary Canal is a continuously hilarious, linguistically inventive parody of two genres: the safari memoir and the layperson's medical compendium. After circumnavigating the exterior of their victim (not omitting the naughty bits), the explorers, without any technological fuss, simply slip through the "Oral Cavern" and before you can say "down the gullet" are riding their portable boat toward their ultimate destination of "Colon-sur-mer," through a surreal jungle environment populated by various tribes such as the savage Haemoglobins, and rich with such wildlife as heeby-geebies and gastroids. The visitors fish for phagocytes, carve their initials on the spine, and are entertained in the Peritoneum by the Great Omentum, a local rajah. Along the way, Chappell satirizes academia, Prohibition, religion, national pride, and our quirky mortal machinery.

Chappell (1877-1946) belonged to that great generation of humorists that included Benchley, Thurber, Perelman and Leacock, and wrote a number of lesser books under the persona of Dr. Traprock. But this slim imaginative masterpiece surely deserves resuscitation. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cur0009.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*****
The non-fact article used to be something of a mainstay in science fiction magazines, though it is seen less frequently today. It is basically a scientific tall tale, told with a poker face and laced with sly humor. The tale may be outrageously fictitious, but it is told as though it is a piece of nonfiction-- a scientific paper, a future history, a newspaper story, a review, a travelogue, or the like. The problem with non-fact articles is that most of them are very minor pieces-- mildly entertaining on a first reading, but quickly forgettable. The specific reasons may vary. Sometimes the writing is poor. Sometimes they are "one trick ponies" that use only a single idea. Sometimes the humor is flat or heavy-handed. Sometimes they lack imagination.

There are a few honorable exceptions to this rule: Isaac Asimov's "The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline" (_Astounding_, 1948), Frederik Pohl's "The Martian Star Gazers" (_Galaxy_, 1962), Alan Danzig's "The Great Nebraska Sea" (_Galaxy_, 1963), and Larry Niven's "Man of Steel-- Woman of Kleenex" (_Knight_, 1967). But the number of well-written non-fact articles remains small.

George S. Chappell's _Through the Alimentary Canal With Gun and Camera_ (1930) is a forerunner of the more recent non-fact articles and is in many ways a model of how to do it well. It was published at the height of the Great Depression and contains an occasional topical reference to this time. For example, after solemnly explaining that the Otis elevator company has postponed plans to install a lift in the spinal column, the narrator complains about conditions in the Interior:

The luxuries have been most hard hit. For instance a number of owners who had thought of putting in new pipe organs have delayed action pending an improvement in general conditions. New construction and bridge work in the Molars is practically at a standstill. Few operators feel that they can do more than make necessary repairs. In general, however, business in the Interior is healthy, goods are moving along nicely and I personally look for distinctly bullish developments before the end of the year. (76)

There are also several references to Prohibition. Here are the travelers in Kidney Country along the Canal:

Bolus-loads of fresh vegetables, meats, fruits, and breadstuffs are frequently mere camouflage for pseudo Scotch, synthetic gin, and bogus Baccardi. A large part of these shipments invariably finds its way into the Kidneys. Here the absorbtion is frankly in defiance of the Constitution. Their attitude, like the state of Connecticut, is "What is the Constitution between Kidneys?" They are a law unto themselves and neither Bishop Cannon nor Mr. Volstead can tell them what to do. (83)

As the title indicates, _Alimentary_ is a travel account of four explorers who journey through the the body of a flat-headed German. Chappell does not try to explain how they do it; they just do. The chapter titles will give you a taste of what is in the book: "We Go To the Head," "Through the Oesophagus," "I Tackle the Aorta," and "The Sources of the Bile". So will some of the captions of Otto Soglow's charming illustrations: "Gold Digging in the Molar Mountains," "I Land My First Phagocyte," "Stalking the Heeby-Geeby in the Forests of the Lumbar Region," and "The Dance of the Haemoglobins".

But this is only a taste. Chappell loved words, and virtually every page of this little book is loaded with puns, word play, poetic parodies, and jokes-- sometimes of a rather elaborate nature. I first read this book in high school, and I found it to be mildly amusing. But I missed most of the jokes that Chappell had imbedded in the text. It was only on later rereadings of the book, after I had learned a little bit more about the world, that I was able to fully appreciate the humor of the book.

George S. Chappell was a friend of the humorist Robert Benchley. Benchley wrote a brief introduction to the book, and is cited several times in the work as "Dr. Benchley"-- not always in a reverent manner. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NMVCJAV0ZHW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VI11HM&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Paul Camp]

Cast in the form of a hilariously ribald parody of a literary quarterly, "The Tar Baby" is a brilliant, audacious, story-filled novel populated by an array of brawling academics and earthy townies. A commemorative issue honoring the late Anatole Waxman-Weissman, the book/journal parodies a number of academic fads and concerns as the various contributors expose their and their subject's many idiosyncrasies while pursuing their own private agendas. - http://www.amazon.com/Tar-Baby-Jerome-Charyn/dp/B0006C6F0G/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
Were I confident that this review would only be read by those already familiar with Michael Cisco’s work, then I would simply say that it’s a Michael Cisco book. No further information would be needed. Michael Cisco is unique and comparisons with any other author seem somehow trite.

This, of course would be of no help whatsoever to those who aren’t familiar with the author’s work. Comparisons will have to be made, to at least give some idea of the book. So, here goes…

I was reminded at various stages of several works, which border on the surreal: Alice in Wonderland, The Yellow Submarine, the works of Franz Kafka.

Like Celebrant, which I previously reviewed, Member involves a quest of sorts. The narrator, who is named Thanks, is an outsider. He doesn’t fit in with modern society and doesn’t want to. He’d rather be left alone. On one of his night time walks (carefully timed with the purpose of minimising any human interaction) he accidentally finds himself in possession of a bag, which contains a dimensional portal. He finds himself in the position of a courier in a cosmic game he doesn’t understand. He’s not alone there. The reader is definitely going to be confused, but they will also be fascinated. I’ve never come across another author who can tell such a complex, weird, confusing story, and yet still make it a page-turner. Somehow, Michael Cisco’s prose is so easy to read that you find yourself simply pulled along in this peculiar dream-like world, where no one will actually tell Thanks what, why, where, or to whom the contents of his bag should be delivered.

There’s a useful glossary at the back, which as often seems to be the case, would have proved more useful had I realised it was there while I was actually reading the book. I’ll quote one entry from that glossary here…

Chorncendantra—the current phase of the cosmic game originating on the artificial planetary system; the game is played by two arbitrarily determined teams across many planets. Chorncendantra is the universal systemmechanism. It is the human game.

Weird, thought-provoking, fascinating, but delicious. If Michael Cisco was a restaurant, he’d be The Fat Duck. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HATKTZMKHJDK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=190768123X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[David L. Brzeski]

*Animal Money* (2015)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
VOICE: “What can you tell us about Animal Money?”

Assiyeh awoke after the conference and began to wonder if all of her revolutionary technologies had made a difference, but it is not the difference that she wondered about, but rather, the idea of the technologies being revolutionary and what it meant for those technologies to be revolutionary. There is a sort of awareness that occurs for Assiyeh while reflecting upon the definition of a revolution and whether or not something can be revolutionary, and her mind began to consider the idea that a revolution is a movement that can only exist in opposition to stagnation and that same movement might better be understood during her attempt to create a state of absolute rest. Assiyeh began to experiment, and her conclusion that we are always moving to search for something that is better than ourselves by constantly creating materials that will enhance our state of existence—whether it is a brand new television set or a new way to have sex by using only your fingertips—each new idea both a quantitative and qualitative doubling from nonexistence to existence. Through discussing the idea or the awareness of the idea there is a doubling that occurs between all individuals who partake in the exchange, for if they did not have the idea before they now have the idea. When you consider what you know about Animal Money and then begin to learn about it, your experience with the very literature that discusses Animal Money doubles your knowledge from zero to something more than zero, which is a sort of doubling. There is always a sort of self-awareness that the exchange is taking place; that an author of a book, for example, knows they are composing a piece that becomes a medium of exchange with the reader, because the reader starts with zero experience with that book and upon completing it becomes the beneficiary or inheritor of a type of currency that is qualitative relative to the reader and the author; the book need not be about Animal Money, but it could be a science fiction novel in which the idea of Animal Money becomes a sort of metaphor for those people or characters who first talked about the idea of Animal Money but could not exactly determine where the idea came from, because their own knowledge of Animal Money became itself an exchange of experiences and ideas…. and the only way to review such a book is to ask what Animal Money is and to wonder whether or not we should expect a certain kind of answer or whether or not there is an answer, or maybe whether or not we are capable of understanding that the question itself exists and we are aware of the question…

(Note: I don't think you can actually review the book, on a philosophical level, but it is very good, interesting, a challenge to read, with aliens or maybe not aliens, with ideas, some action or maybe not action depending on whether or not everything is a dream, and if it is a dream or not a dream then what is fiction if not Animal Money...?) - https://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZV2N2BLM1XXU/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621052125&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Vincenzo Bilof]

[[The_Narrator]]
*The Narrator* (2015)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Narrator-Michael-Cisco/dp/1621051854/[Amazon]

*****
A man named Low is the narrator, and also The Narrator, of The Narrator. But it isn't quite that kind of twisty turny ho-ho I've got you now dumb reader! sort of book. Just as The Traitor was about the rise of the state, The Narrator is about how the state exists via ideo-linguistic concent. Narrators in Cisco's imaginary Europe--there's a da Vinci in this setting at least, along with magic and spirits--tell the stories the wealthy and powerful need everyone else to hear. Competition is pretty fierce actually, and our man Low is a polyglot of significant ability. He'd need to be as the world he navigates and narrates is awash in languages both written and spoken. Indeed, the wealthy often commission the creation of their own alphabets (not fonts, alphabets) from Narrators like Low.

And poor Low has been drafted, and his conscription has been cemented by the supernatural gaze of an Edek, a blind remnant of once-great imperial power. Low is not happy. "An army is a horror," is how he decides to start his story, "It's a horrible thing. They say you might change your mind about that when the country is invaded and your people are suffering wrong, but for me this is all just more horror, more army-horror." Not a sentiment one often hears today, but then again today the narrators of contemporary wars don't really concentrate on conflicts between the armed forces of countries that have a rough military parity, do they?

Low quickly falls in with a bunch of other people about as well-suited to engage in war as he is. There's Jil Punkinflake, a sort of priest of death and dying, who is actually jovial and fun, as his fantasy name suggests. In any other fantasy novel about war, he'd be the guy singing songs and falling headfirst into buckets for comic relief. There's also Makemin, the brave and resolute commander who definitely deserves a fragging. There's even a kick-butt fantasy heroine with a strong arm and a stronger will. Of course, she also spent a fair amount of time in the lunatic asylum, as one would.

Low's forces are hoping that the spirits in a far-flung corner of the land will support their operational goals over those of their enemies. The Narrator and the narrator and Our Narrator run up against the central question of history--what the hell is actually going on, and why are people even bothering to risk their lives doing things like securing a harbor? One is reminded of the only funny thing ever to come out of the mouth of a Maoist: when Zhou Enlai was asked about the historical impact of the French Revolution of 1789, he responded, "It's too early to tell." Well poor Low is right up against it, and as the guy in charge of telling the story of the war he's in for his side without the benefit of hindsight, or any stake in the outcome of the war, or even safety, he's come up a bit short.

There are many exciting battles and action scenes in The Narrator--the enemies are called blackbirds because they use lighter-than-air metal wristlets and anklets to fly for short distances. Low's squad is augmented by loonies from the mental hospital, and they're always fun, if unpredictable, in battle. Low is a medic and a translator, so spends a lot of his time observing the fight and then watching his friends die. Then he is given a magic charm that will allow him to lead his team more or less safely past the Lake of Broken Glass--a neverending windstorm of glass shards that swoops around every so often--and ruins proximity to which causes people to sicken and die (radiation?), to finally petition the gods for success. Too bad the whole point of having a narrator around is to have a story for posterity, so nobody really cares what Low thinks or says in the moment. There is even a traditional "meet the enemy and he is us" moment, when Low encounters the narrators from the other side of the war. They don't really know what the hell is going on either.

The Narrator is about the dual frustrations of the intellectual in an era of endless conflict--they're smart enough to know what's not going on ("They hate our freedoms!"), but can't get anybody to believe it. There's also no lone intellectual smart enough to know what actually is going on, despite the tendency to speak definitively on historical subjects. Quick, why did the Soviet Union fall? Really? Is that all? Is that the only reason? The only five, the only ten? And anyway, Low isn't half as smart as he'd like to be, or as his troops hoped he would be.

One might get the sense that Cisco is "subverting" fantasy tropes here, but of course these days apparently every fantasist in the world gets to make that claim if they do anything other than photocopy The Lord of the Rings and hand it in as their manuscript. But one might say that Cisco is a subverter along the lines of China Mieville rather than the my-elves-are-different crowd. So why is Cisco so obscure while Mieville is popular? Editorial pique, I suppose is most of it. The rest is probably a mix of personal charisma, Fortuna, and Cisco not whipping up enough monsters for the fanboys. Sad, that. If only Bruno Schulz had survived his war experience and launched a great fantasy trilogy, then Cisco would be richer than ten Bolivian Nazis! In another world, perhaps the world of The Narrator, this may have already happened. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XQ0MFE13H1TH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621051854&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

*****
In 2009, the writer-narrator finds a Box. Within it lie the pages of her very first manuscript, pages she thought she had long since thrown away. Le Prénom de Dieu was the text that marked the start of her prodigious career, and yet for the narrator it is also the Nameless Book, the-Book-that-could-never-be-read, the book written by someone other than her. Now, once again, it heralds a beginning, as its discovery is the start of a journey into the past.

The title, with its reference to the murderous Ourang-Outang of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Murders in the Rue Morgue, sets the scene: this is a detective story haunted by literary ghosts. At the very heart of literature lies the fascination with the enigma, the search for something that has been lost. Cixous illustrates this as she leads her reader on a hunt for the ultimate hidden treasure, in the company of an array of venerable predecessors from Saint-Simon, Proust and Stendhal to Shackleton, Poe and Jacques Derrida.

Double Oblivion of the Ourang-Outang is a text about literature. It speaks of the books you read and the books you write, those you remember and those you forget, those you fear and those you revere. It is also a powerful, evocative tale of beginnings and endings, of remembering and forgetting, of things and their doubles.

In a densely woven narrative, Cixous’s latest text focuses on the extraordinary voyage that is literary creation, and in doing so also explores the themes of memory, loss and subjectivity. -  https://www.amazon.com/Double-Oblivion-Ourang-Outang-H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne-Cixous/dp/074565391X/[Amazon]

*****
As another reader has rated this item (as a one-star), this novel is NOT for "whodunnit", mystery lovers. If you are looking for a twisted 'plot' to entertain, this will not satisfy your desires.

A brilliantly written existential portrait of the despair spawned by modernity's ills (the setting is an isolated beach cottage amongst the dunes, a mythical place only a train away from the hub of NYC, the obsession that drives the poet-protagonist is one of modernity's sins (i.e., the obscenity of flesh, the empowerment of women, the plight of social 'classes', and so on)--Wisteria Cottage gripped me in its intensity. Dark, melodious (the flow of the words is poignantly poetic), and compelling, Robert Coates' depth of access to a fascinating (killer) consciousness is frightening in its realistic detachment and unnerving sensical-ness.

The protagonist poet-killer is a man of unstable moods and erratic constitution (he talks to himself, rapes, kills, is in psychiatry's terms a 'sociopath'), and most of the novel is written in his voice--in the third-person. Although we are brought into his world of sympathies, we are kept at a distance (by the simple fact that the third person does not allow as much intimacy as first person narratives). And, at times the flow is interrupted by excerpts from 'Psychiatrist's reports' of future studies into this criminal mind. These and other bits, written from the perspective of other characters, serve to make salient the protagonists' dark moods and their unexplainable nature (i.e., the 'organic' nature of the moods, influenced in content by themes inspired by modernity).

I could not put Wisteria Cottage, finished it very quickly--brilliant (and dark, creepy, moody, existentially scary). - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGI50U34TOKY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=087795710X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ioana Stoica]

[[Witz]]
*Witz* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Witz-American-Literature-Dalkey-Archive/dp/1564785882/[Amazon]

*****
This reminded me of a post-Holocaust Kafka, combined with Joycean wordplay, Pynchonesque ideas, and Beckettian melancholy. The words derived from "Jew" never appear except in the subtitle. Their absence haunts this ambitious novel.

For Joshua Cohen's own version of a "lipogram," a work with a missing symbol, Benjamin Israelien's void after another, now total, global decimation of the Chosen People erodes him from the inside out. His inauthenticity as a Jewish survivor provokes the animosity of the rest of the world. Ben alone remains to become what turns out more the scapegoat than the Messianic harbinger with tidings of comfort and joy. Cohen stretches his somber saga over eight hundred pages.

The novel's span challenges neat summation. Briefly, his family and his birth-- full grown, bearded, hirsute--takes up the first couple of hundred pages with fine print and extended riffs. Cohen relishes food, babble, trivia. The demise of the Jews quickly gives way to their kitsch revival, "in a language nobody speaks but everybody's studying."

Cohen hurries over whatever sense would be in this catastrophe, oddly. He grants us a few powerful scenes of media coverage of this sudden death. Logic diminishes; a reader must put up with whatever Cohen dishes out to a put-upon Ben and the sketchily drawn cabal that unsuccessfully manages his marketing.

He makes us pay attention to the page. It takes patience to stay afloat amid so many verbal depth charges. Submerged into this book, you gasp for air. The force of Cohen's atmosphere presses down on you.

Ben stops at where he would have gone to school, "yet another inheritance deferred." There, "chalk remains from the happy clap of appreciative erasers smeared into the spirals of shoes out on permanent recess." Cohen can write, certainly. But does he write.

It's no wonder Kafka and his Castle edge into the setting at his re-created Whateverwitz, in an inverted "Messianic victory of the bornagain." Why the rest of humanity would wish to convert never gets answered. (Who supervised their conversions after the demise of the firstborn, with all those but Ben born-Jewish dead, I wondered?) People simply change, in a dream logic that pulls along enigmatic, infantile, behemoth Ben against this current of subversion.

I felt that Cohen insisted on a chiasmus -- an inversion of Jew and non-Jew, persecution and acceptance -- that left him no other choice than this for his story. This pace barely bothers with plot. Cohen's concern's not with character. Instead, Cohen determines to force us to accept his world based on ideas, language, and monologues more than dialogues. Perhaps as with Torah or Talmud, this text documents an anthology of human foibles and restrictions and pleas rather than a seamless literary narrative, despite (or in spite of) its very craft.

The firstborn before they will succumb to another plague wonder: "what is a question? How to answer. Will you be at all. Or will you opt out. Don't you want to be. When you're all grown up to dead. Their seder to be interrupted -- libelous, the matzah weeps blood. The seat at the head of the table is empty and will be forever. You'll get used to it." Passages like this may elicit emotion, but they nestle within adamantine blocks of prose. Chunked chapters may crush the patience of all but the few readers nimble enough to catch the Yiddish, the Hebrew, the Judaica tossed here into a tall, deep scrap pile.

In its messianic themes, breadth of Jewish references, and dense erudition, Witz recalls Arthur A. Cohen's In the Days of Simon Stern (1972). In its headlong final rush into the evocation of the Holocaust by its last survivor, Joseph Cohen, it echoes passages from George Steiner's The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.(1980). This stand-alone coda of thirty pages as one death sentence after a life lived in pain and struggle is titled "Punchlines." Breathed into one long recital -- after eight hundred pages of Ben's tale, which lurched about as its protagonist did in an unstable, wobbly gait -- the novel's last gasp finds its stand-up routine that knocks them dead, a negative correlation, its center of gravity.

In its demands, Witz nears Tolstoy's epics in length and Kafka's fables in tone. Combine these with Ben's character of gargantuan appetites, albeit one who eludes the sympathy of the patient, if baffled, reader. The result may be less successful than some of Cohen's storied predecessors, yet it may surprise you. A few readers may undertake Cohen's rigorous wake. It resurrects linguistic excavations and intellectual fixations as a narrative "Exodust" that burrows into a tome nine years in the making. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB7SQBHHD82V/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564785882&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[John L Murphy]

*****
It's good to see this offbeat little classic back in print. John Collier is perhaps better known for his short stories, but this first novel was an exquisitely funny satire. It tells the story of Emily, a chimpanzee who pines for a certain Englishman, Mr. Fatigay, while he teaches school in Africa. When Fatigay returns to England, he takes the friendly chimp with him as a companion, for he realizes that she is clever... though he has no idea that the silent chimp is able to read and to recite literature in her head, nor that she loves him. Emily is handed over to Mr. Fatigay's human girlfriend in England, who will tolerate no rival of any sort and treats her new servant shabbily. Still, Emily finds time to dress up and sneak out to London and the British Museum Reading room (where she is taken for a fascinating woman of mystery!) among other absurd adventures. Though the book is lighthearted, we do feel for its protagonist and her hidden love. Collier has a keen eye for the petty foibles of humankind, and of course the big joke is that the chimp is more intelligent and sensitive than any human here. The premise is somewhat outrageous, but the good writing allows us to suspend disbelief and go along for a ride filled with subtle giggles and wicked belly laughs. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M0VGP1PXBJS2/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0966491335[kennedy19]

*Worm Forgives the Plough* (1946)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Forgives-Plough-Penguin-Country-Library/dp/0140590129/[Amazon]

*****
This book consists of two sections narrating John Stewart Collis' Second World War-time experience working on farms in the English counties of Sussex and Dorset (published together in 1946 as While Following the Plough), a further section of rather more philosophical reflection on that experience, and a final section - both narrative and philosophical - on working for a year as a forester, also during WW2 and in Dorset. The latter two sections were first published in 1947 as Down to Earth.

When Collis opted for a wartime posting in the Land Army, he was 40 years old, had a wife and children (evacuated to the United States) and was already established as an author. He had no previous experience of farm work. Remarkable as it may seem, he appears to have settled-in tolerably well with the work of an agricultural laborer, with the horses, farm machinery, fellow workers and employing farmers, and most definitely to have enjoyed his exposure to nature, the seasons and the weather. When, later in the war, he turned to forestry, that for him was even better. There were of course moments of crisis when his lack of skill with horses and equipment had unhappy consequences, plus occasional tension with fellow workers, but for one determinedly jumping into the deep end he seems to have enjoyed a relatively pain-free experience, helped no doubt by being reasonably adept, a fast learner, and of equable character.

As readers, we discover much about farming at that time; a time made particularly interesting not only by the war-time aspect but by it being in any case the cusp of change from the old horse-powered, labor intensive ways to tractors, combine harvesters and unprecedented advance in agricultural productivity. We join in the adventure of the townsman going to live and work in the countryside, and learn with him of a huge range of natural phenomena, from the carbon cycle to the importance to the landscape of earthworms, to the cropping sequences of fruit crops and cereals; and the finer points of building and unbuilding hay and corn ricks, setting up a field for plowing and the various cash products of an ash forest. And much more besides.

Introducing The Worm Forgives the Plough as a combined volume in 1973, Collis noted the disappearance of corn and hay ricks and suggested that his book was about the last of its kind that could be written in England. Not defining 'its kind' as strictly as Collis, we may hope that the venerable line of writing about farming and the countryside to which he contributed may yet be continued. But nothing could detract from this account of agricultural life and work at a momentous time. Without question, it is a unique treasure. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9E3TJVKVZNW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140590129&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lost John]

"MERVYN Wall's The Unfortunate Fursey (1946) is a classic fantasy novel about an inept monk thrust out of his monastery to wander in the world of temptation. It has a far lesser-known precursor in Monk's Magic, with a similar set-up, and an equally devilish humor.

Here Brother Dismas works on behalf of his Abbot, stealthily studying the black arts (he has been absolved in advance for his sins), trying to discover the elixir of life. After many failures, Dismas ventures out into the world to find those previous and successful fellow-seekers who must surely still live. Dismas gathers a band of characters including the boy Gabriel and the barrel-like man Thomas Brackenridge. The three set off to Germany in search of one particular philosopher, Lucius Germanicus, whose cryptic formula Dismas had tried unsuccessfully. Dismas grows up during his failed quest, deals with a robber baron, and comes to love the girl Radegond (who had pretended to be the boy Gabriel). When he returns to the Abbot, Dismas summons the Prince of Darkness (whom he now suspects may also be God), and receives some excellent secular advice about life. The tale is Rabelaisian in the best sense, witty and well-written.

Alexander de Comeau (1894-1930) worked in the British Consular Service in the Canal Zone in the 1920s. His one other novel, Fires of Isis (1926), is not fantasy. Monk's Magic appeared posthumously, following the author's suicide after the death of his wife." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2016/cur1603.htm[Douglas A. Anderson]

Rosanne and Edward step through a magic door in Edinburgh and arrive in the city of Adambara, in the land of Los. (Cue the Blake exegesis.) Rosanne becomes a slave girl (shades of Gor!) and Edward a soldier, both enlisted against the technocratic fascism of neighboring Verula. Toss in some quantum physics and self-actualization, recounted Edwardian-style ("As you can see, strange visitor—"), and you begin to wonder if Comfort ever climaxed without dissecting his experience." - Paul Di Filippo

*****
Brendan Connell, courtesy of the creative editorial department of Chômu Press, dishes up another delectable entrée with his wildly imaginative LIVES OF NOTORIOUS COOKS, a collection of 51 short stories or bits of reportage of chefs throughout history (or best we qualify that as legend) `from Agis to Xavier, from a cannibalistic ancient Greek and his consensual victims/victuals, to a Bourbon King of France who cooked ortolons within the bellies of partridges.'

Each very brief (at times only a page or two) bit of farce and whimsy offers an insider's (pardon the expression) slightly off kilter view of not only chefs but also the grisly and morbid and hilarious concoctions they seem to be preparing for us, the readers. Blogger Gordon Hauptfleisch sums the book up beautifully: ' Indeed, the inventive Connell's dry and sly and matter-of-macabre-fact intonation throughout Lives of Notorious Cooks aptly complements the sparse pointedness and incisiveness of the tales. And while some of the more bare-bones and too-brief tales of misery and imagination are a little too undernourished and enigmatic for their own good and for our edification, for the most part the author's minutely-honed craftsmanship allows us to the read between the lines and connect a few more dots than we are used to doing, making what Connell's cooked up here more challenging but ultimately more rewarding. And perhaps preparing us for whatever Denny's is serving up should they start to take too many liberties with our beloved Grand Slams. Side order of boiled cow udders with that?'

A bit out of Connell's kettle serves as an appetizer: `When he reached the age of 767, Peng Zu was sought after by the benevolent Emperor Yao, who wished to receive advice on ruling the nation. Peng Zu made a thick soup for the emperor out of pheasant, Job's tear seeds and plums, well salted. Eating the dish, the emperor felt as if he were sitting on air. He was filled with a deep cosmic joy in which he saw everything clearly. "You see," Peng Zu said, "the gravest problems of state can be resolved over a bowl of soup. The people, seeing you live frugally will not resent you. When the ruler is calm, the nation is calm."

For those familiar with Connell's other successes, such as `The Life of Polycrates and Other Stories for Antiquated Children', the at time irascible humor of this book will not surprise. Brendan Connell is a master of the macabre. Tighten up the napkin and feast on these morsels! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3327YQO5LR118/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907681205&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Grady Harp]

...

Serena Plievir is a flutist. She has an expensive taste in art and she needs to pay the bills somehow, so she assassinates people and gets paid for executing the murders. Her first victim is Leslie who tries to sell a stolen painting. She executes the murder perfectly. Then she gets a contract to kill Pier, who's a 20-year-old cross-dresser. That's when things become weirder and more complex, because Serena finds herself in a complicated situation and doesn't know how to exterminate Pier. She becomes involved with Pier's family and soon Pier's mother, Gemma, becomes fascinated and attracted by her...

Brendan Connell creates an excellent and memorable vision of European culture and society and urban decay in this novel. Writing wittily about European culture and society is often difficult for several readers, but in my opinion Brendan Connell is one of the few authors who succeed in it. He also manages the difficult feat of writing fluently and fascinatingly about customs strange and peculiar without appearing to be condescending. I also have to mention that he writes boldly and unflinchingly about all things connected to sexuality. (It's truly refreshing to read a story in which all of these things are in balance.)

This novel has a wonderfully inventive structure, because there are sections (and footnotes) that describe the names of famous flute players and the types of prostitutes that were found in ancient Greece etc, and then the story continues in a normal way. These sections are truly interesting, because the author has added several details to them. The author has also written one paragraph backwards so that it needs to be viewed in the mirror - this is rare in literary novels.

The unusual structure isn't the only thing that separates this novel from other novels. This novel requires quite a lot of concentration from the readers, because it's much more complex than several other novels out there on the market. In my opinion this is great, because I love reading novels that make you think about what you're reading.

In several places the prose is charmingly poetic and lyrical, but also deliciously sharp. Brendan Connell's descriptions of the events are beautiful and they transport the reader into a true literary bliss (it isn't often that readers have a chance to read something like this, because finding this kind of descriptive prose is extremely difficult nowadays). His descriptions of the characters and their traits are wonderfully vivid, and his observations on society are as sharp as they are accurate. He easily creates a perfect atmosphere for the pleasant and unpleasant happenings.

I have to mention that I love Brendan Connell's twisted sense of humour very much, because his humour is often pitch black and he manages to surprise the reader with his nuanced humour. His humour is also fresh and playful.

Serena Plievir is an intriguing character, because she's a flutist who murders people for money. One of the things that makes her interesting is that she prefers not to kill young people (in her opinion killing young people is "miserable work"). The author wrote well about Serena's work and what she did to get close to her targets. It was interesting to read how Serena got to know Pier, Glauco and Gemma and got involved with them (I also enjoyed reading about how Serena felt about the family). The author also wrote fascinatingly about Serena's exquisite taste in fine arts and music.

I think it's possible that Nikita (played by Anne Parillaud in the film Nikita [aka La Femme Nikita]) and other famous female assassins from different movies and TV series may have been sources of inspiration for the author when he has created the character of Serena Plievir. I'm not sure if the character of Alice Morgan (played by Ruth Wilson in the British crime series Luther) has been a source of inspiration to the author, but it's possible, because the characters of Alice and Serena have a few similarities. There are of course plenty of differences, because Serena murders people in order to get money and has an expensive taste in art, but I can almost see Ruth Wilson as Serena.

*****
THIS collection of essays and squibs by the high priest of literary Modernism includes some cruelly funny satires—like "Ninety Years of Novel-Reviewing," designed to crush the hopes of any budding fiction critic—and mordant parodies.

"Told in Gath" elegantly sends up Aldous Huxley's early novels, with a country house called Groyne hosting a high-society party that glitters with rhinestones of too-clever dialogue. At the weekend's climactic séance, someone accidentally breaks a tube of anthrax bacilli and apocalypse looms. "Death! the distinguished visitor!" is awaited with appropriate sang-froid: "After all, what is anthrax?"

"Year Nine" spoofs every sf nightmare of totalitarian dystopia, especially 1984 by Connolly's Eton school-chum George Orwell. England's past heritage is being offically erased by dull civil servants like the doomed protagonist, who's led astray by banned Degenerate Art: "Jewlysses. Winagains Fake." Farcically betrayed, tortured and condemned, he still loves Big Brother. "Yes, I have been treated with great kindness."

Surprisingly, "Year Nine" first appeared in 1938—eleven years before 1984, two years before Koestler's Darkness at Noon. Connolly must have been reading Zamyatin's We (trans 1920).

The later Previous Convictions (1963) includes his most infamous parody, "Bond Strikes Camp." Here Agent 007 faces his toughest ever challenge when, to entice an arch-villain with specialized tastes, he must climb into drag as "Gerda Blond." Will Q Division's advanced equipment ("The very latest in falsies—foam rubber, with electronic self-erecting nipples") be enough to carry Bond through this tightest of tight spots? You must read the story. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2014/cur1411.htm[David Langford]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Baseball-Association-Henry-Waugh/dp/0452260302/[Amazon]

*****
I don't recommend this book for the faint of heart. While you can summarize the basic story of "The Universal Baseball Association" in a few words, the actual reading experience is far more intense than a summary would suggest. This book celebrates the myth of baseball as American creation in just about the darkest way imaginable.

The novel's set-up is an appealing one. J. Henry Waugh (whose initials read YAHWEH) took eight of the original post-Civil War major league franchises, populated them entirely with players of his own invention, and evolved his league through dozens of seasons via a tabletop, dice-activated baseball game of his own design. The league begins to consume his life in its 56th season -- and his 56th year. It sounds fun to take on a project like this. Indeed, on the Internet you can even find recreations of the UBA charts as J. Henry Waugh may have designed them.

As the book goes on, however, progressively fewer paragraphs are devoted to the point of view of our protagonist. Rather, Henry's players -- unaware of his very existence -- begin to do all the talking for him. The slide begins innocently enough: Henry leaves work a few minutes early one Wednesday afternoon so he can reread the boxscore of a perfect game one of "his" rookies pitched the night before. While reading, he imagines the past greats of his league telling stories about the early years. In one of the book's funnier moments, one of those old-time players is suddenly cut off in mid-quote when Henry realizes that the man in question is, in fact, dead.

Thus we learn more about Henry's league: His players live full lives after retirement from the playing field, and can even marry, have children, and die. The league structure involves politics, intrigue, romance, music -- sometimes all at once. One of the book's more gruesome in-jokes is retold in a ballad that Henry wrote to celebrate the exploits of one "Long Lew Lydell".

As the book progresses, Coover writes verbose yet carefully structured passages in which Henry vanishes entirely, replaced by the players taking increasing free reign over his subconscious. What the players say in Henry's head is a subtle distortion of what Henry's just been through. Henry's take on women is colored, for example, by the fact that his girlfriend charges by the hour; his players have dreams which mirror his own anxieties. It gets so that Henry can't even complete a conversation with the few acquaintainces in his life, without the players' voices intruding. This becomes progressively more disturbing, especially if you note what happens during Henry's final appearance in the book.

You can't blame Henry for leaving behind such a dreary accounting job; he is escaping into a richer world than did Bartleby, for example. In fact, you could put the book down after Chapter 7 and read it as a happy ending. In 2005, I'd almost venture to say that "Office Space"-type fantasies retroactively make Henry one of the first heroes of the so-called information age. One of the key questions at the end: are we meant to feel sympathy for Henry at the end? Empathy? Pity? Disgust?

What gives "Universal Baseball Association" its life is not the baseball scenes or the office scenes, but rather the depth and texture of Henry's increasingly complicated fantasy sequences. You can see the entropy in Henry's universe by comparing the player names in the final chapter to those in the first two chapters, before things started to go wrong. While difficult to get through -- this is certainly not a beach book, although that's where I read most of it -- "Universal Baseball Association" rewards repeated readings once you overcome the queasy feelings caused by entering Henry's subconscious.

You will also vow never to play Strat-O-Matic Baseball again. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RFWZSZIVS0IN/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452260302[Jason A. Miller]

*****
"Decades ago, every used-book sale featured a copy of The Collected Tales of A. E. Coppard, token of the author's quondam popularity. But Coppard (1878-1957) is mostly forgotten today except for "Adam and Eve and Pinch Me," oft-anthologized. A shame, given his large talents as evidenced in Pink Furniture. It's a charming, touching romp of sadly out-of-fashion Learesque nonsense ("We had a crooked bishop once,/With geometric views,/His texts were perpendicular,/His sermons quite obtuse.") conjoined with Moers-style daft adventures.

Young Toby lives with Aunt and Uncle Notright somewhat contentedly, but ultimately plans on bravely running away. When pal Bridget mentions the legendary and highly desirable Pink Furniture, "He resolved never to return to school, but to go forth into the world and think about Pink Furniture for hours at a stretch, and seek for nothing but Pink Furniture until he found some."

Toby meets a Tom Bombadil-type, "the Forester," then makes a trip to the Hedgehog Market ("Fine quilly hogs, with snouts like apples and mad with fury!"), the prelude to many miraculous and alarming escapades, including an intermediate quest for the book known as Open and Ask Me. A long stay in Purganda, home to obsessive readers, segues into a pirate attack and abandonment on the island of Patcat, where the Open and Ask Me is found, and the enigma of Pink Furniture partially dissipated. Back home, as with Dorothy in Kansas, Toby and Bridget discover Pink Furniture right on their hearth.

Of the many lessons learned, I choose to remember this one: "Love is a panther's foot/And none may see its claws."" - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2019/cur1901.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*Sam Dunn Is Dead: Futurist Novel* (1917, 2015)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
Sam Dunn is Dead was described by its author Bruno Corra (1892-1976) as a "Futurist Novel" and was first published in book form by Filippo Marinetti's Edizioni Futuriste in 1917. Yet one will search in vain for any mention of this work in anthologies of Futurism. The novel's erasure is doubtless because it is so unlike anything else produced by Futurism (an ardent, masculine, positive and absurdly serious movement). Sam Dunn is Dead, a small masterpiece of black humor, is none of these things.
Not only is Sam Dunn at once funny, despairing, cerebral and ludicrous, it also traces a history in miniature of the modern spirit. It commences with a description of its eponymous hero, a languid 1890s poet who is about to unleash a thoroughly contemporary apocalypse upon the world. Subsequent chapters could be mistaken for Dadaist or Surrealist texts (but written a decade before their time), and then the whole edifice is fatally undermined by forces that are both banal and unusual (to avoid revealing too much). Corra subsequently considered his novel a failure, but today his sensitivity to the great undertows of history seems alarmingly prescient, and neither opinion should interfere with the reader's simple enjoyment of this novel's deliriously ebullient nihilism. - https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Dunn-Dead-Futurist-Novel/dp/0993148700/[Amazon blurb]

*****
Back in the 1970s, the US edition of "Hopscotch" -- part of Avon's series of several dozen mass market paperback translations of major Latin American authors, a literary project unimaginable today -- featured on its cover a melancholy caricature of the author, Julio Cortázar. Maybe I wasn't alone in getting the impression that he was a depressing read. Decades later, when I finally sat down to read him, though, I discovered my big mistake: although his writing isn't typically optimistic, it's often incredibly funny.

This book from 1975 is a great example: farcical even for Cortázar, but with a serious edge as well. The story, narrated in the first person, includes panels from an actual issue of a Mexican comic book featuring the anti-hero Fantomas. The comic's story line drew on Fantomas's friendship with "Julio, Octavio, Alberto and Susan" -- as in Cortázar, Paz, Moravia and Sontag, major late 20th Century authors much better known by the general public back then than they or writers of comparable quality are today. There's also a wonderful sequence of panels where Fantomas's "civilian" alter ego explains Bertolt Brecht to his socialite girlfriend, Ira von Fürstenberg (also a real-life person). The comic's plot revolves around a fanatic's scheme to destroy the world's literature, both by making books disappear and by physically threatening authors. (The full comic, issue 201 of "Fantomas, La amenaza elegante" [Fantomas, the elegant menace], is available online in Spanish from a blog called "mundofantomas;" it includes some additional enjoyable panels about Brecht, especially.)

Somehow Cortázar transitions from his finding the comic book at the Brussels train station to his actually being friends with Fantomas. Eventually the comic's panels fall away and Cortázar the character is pulling Fantomas into the work real-life Cortázar was doing as part of the Second Russell Tribunal, which was investigating the brutality of several Latin American military regimes. The task is shown to be beyond even Fantomas's capabilities. The real Tribunal's findings are included as an appendix to the book.

One can criticise some aspects of Cortázar's political engagement as naïve: e.g., his admiration for the Cuban Revolution, without acknowledging its harsh treatment of dissidents. But the military brutality in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and elsewhere that he decried was real. In any case, he's never so shrill about politics as to lose his self-deprecating sense of humor, such as in relating his unsuccessful attempts to attract a blonde sitting across from him in his train compartment, or how he paced around in his apartment "smoking in the manner one learns from suspense films."

Given the book's genre-bending storytelling, it's no wonder this translation has been published through Semiotext(e), a literary theory journal. It's too bad the price is relatively steep for such a slim book. My copy of "Hopscotch," printed in 1975 when an oil crisis was inflating the cost of ink, had a cover price of just $2.95; that comes out to under $12 in today's dollars, for which you got 570 pages, not 87. But considering how much I enjoyed the book compared to, say, some movies I've paid to see in theaters, I didn't regret the bargain. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AC2G1OG3ZL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1584351349&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

*****
It has taken me years to sit down and finally make a serious commitment to read Julio Cortazar's "Hopscotch/La Rayuela." I cannot think of a better companion to devote a few weeks to, maybe even a bit longer - hey, whatever it takes! It depends on your reading speed and the time you take to savor the poetry of the author's language. So, be willing to make a small personal investment in this very special novel, and the reward you reap will be a worthy one. Julio Cortazar will take you to places you have never been before in literature, and may never experience again. I read "Hopscotch" over this past summer, after a thirty year delay. I can be real stubborn about putting off what is good for me!! Cortazar's imagination is boundless, his prose rich and luminous, his wit and sophistication rare, the dialogue brilliant, the plot...I won't attempt to describe that with a few adjectives. Wander through the extraordinary labyrinthine plot on you own - the way is yours to discover. I promise, you won't get lost!

My introduction to "La Rayuela", (which means hopscotch, like the children's game), is a personal story. I will make it quick. About 30 years ago, while living in Latin America, a friend told me that I reminded him of a character in a novel. The character, La Maga - the book "La Rayuela/Hopscotch." With personal interests at stake and much curiosity, I bought a copy in Spanish, which I read with some fluency at the time. After experimenting with which way to approach the novel, and trying both ways, I gave up...and just read the parts about La Maga. I was too impatient at that point in my life, and needed to become a mellower person, to read slower, with more of a sense of play and participation. And Cortazar wants his readers to participate - to make reading his book an interactive experience, not a passive one. I was and still feel touched when I remember my friend's comments regarding La Maga. She is a magnificent character and Cortazer's prose, his language, (Spanish), is exquisite. So, I thought I'd give it another try, in English, perhaps with better results. None! I just wasn't ready, I guess. That happens to me with fiction sometimes. I have to be open to the experience. However, after all these years, I still thought of Horacio Oliveira and La Maga from time to time. And why not? They are truly unforgettable. As I wrote above, I did make time, at last. For an adventure of a lifetime, I recommend you do the same.

When Julio Cortazar published "La Rayuela" in 1966, he turned the conventional novel upside-down and the literary world on its ear with this experiment in writing fiction. He soon became an important influence on writers everywhere. "Hopscotch" is considered to be one of the best novels written in Spanish. This is an interactive novel where readers are invited to rearrange its sections and read them in different sequences. Read in a linear fashion, "Hopscotch" contains 700 pages, 155 chapters in three sections: "From the Other Side," and "From This Side" - the first two sections are sustained by relatively chronological narratives and so contrast greatly with the third section, "From Diverse Sides," (subtitled "Expendable Chapters"), which includes philosophical extrapolation, character study, allusions and quotations, and an entirely different version of the "ending."

The book has no table of contents, but rather a "Table of Instructions." There, we learn that two approved readings are possible: from Chapter 1 through 56 "in a normal fashion", or from Chapter 73 to Chapter 1 to... well, wherever the chapters lead you. The instructions are all in your book and are extremely clear. At the end of each chapter there is a numeric indicator to lead the reader to the next chapter. One never knows where one will be lead. Due to its meandering nature, "Hopscotch" has been called a "Proto-hypertext" novel. Cortázar probably had this work in mind when he stated, "If I had the technical means to print my own books, I think I would keep on producing collage-books."

What is most important, as a reviewer, is to give you, the prospective reader, an idea of the narrative and the characters...and to tell you why reading this novel was such an extraordinary experience for me. Horacio Oliveira, our protagonist and sometimes narrator, is an Argentinean expatriate, an intellectual and professed writer in 1950's bohemian Paris. He and his close friends, members of "the Club," do lots of partying, drinking, and intellectualizing, discussing art, literature, music and solving the world's problems. Oliveira lives with and loves La Maga, an exotic young woman, somewhat whimsical, at times almost ephemeral who leaves behind her, like the scent of a light perfume, a feeling of poignancy and inevitable loss. La Maga refuses to plan her encounters with Oliveira in advance, preferring instead to run into each other by chance. Then she and Oliveira celebrate the series of circumstances that reunite them - although he knows well the places she frequents and is capable of causing at least a few planned surprises. Eventually, he loses La Maga, who loses her child. With her absence, Oliveira realizes how empty and meaningless his life is and he returns to his native Buenos Aires. There he finds work first as a salesman, then a keeper of a circus cat, and an attendant in an insane asylum.

As Oliveira wends his way through France, Uruguay and Argentina looking for his lost love, "Hopscotch's" narrative takes on an emotionally intense stream of consciousness style, rich in metaphor. Back In Argentina, Oliveira shares his life with his bizarre double, Traveler, and Traveler's wife, Talita, whom Oliveira attempts to remake into a facsimile of La Maga. The game of hopscotch is only developed as a conceit late in the narrative. It is first used to describe Oliveira's confused love for La Maga as "that crazy hopscotch." The theme develops as a metaphor for reaching Heaven from Earth. "When practically no one has learned how to make the pebble climb into Heaven, childhood is over all of a sudden and you're into novels, into the anguish of the senseless divine trajectory, into the speculation about another Heaven that you have to learn to reach too." The variations on the children's game are described as "spiral hopscotch, rectangular hopscotch, fantasy hopscotch, not played very often." The allusions continue and include some beautiful passages.

"Hopscotch" is much more than a novel. Ultimately, it is best left for each reader to define what it is for himself/herself. Pablo Neruda in a famous quote said, "People who do not read Cortazar are doomed. Not to read him is a serious invisible disease." I don't know whether I would go so far. Remember, I put off the experience for many years. But this is one novel that should be read during one's lifetime. It is brilliant and it is fun! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N16NNBX6AEOB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394752848&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jana L. Perskie]

*****
This book was first published in 1964 in Paris. Its author, Albert Cossery, was born in Cairo in 1913 of well-off Greek Orthodox parents and was educated in French schools. He befriended Henry Miller while he served as a ship steward and was in the US. His first book, "Men God Forgot," published in Cairo in 1941 in French, came to the attention of Albert Camus. Cossery's writing in this book is unique, takes a dark view and turns it into sarcastic hilarity, and reminds me very much of Russian literature, specifically Dostoevsky. Yet, in spite of this novel's cynical view of politicians, authority figures, materialism, and the pathetic strivings of the working classes to rise up the economic ladder, there is a spiritual side to it and a genuine feeling of empathy for the sadly disenfranchised. One of the main characters, Heykal, is an impoverished "revolutionary" who is presented as being above the fray, an aristocrat, an unemotional anarchist who uses irony and hyperbolic exaggeration to unseat the oppressive "governor" and his corrupt cronies. He is above the run of the mill revolutionaries, doesn't throw bombs, but rather throws jokes and pranks at power to unseat it. He's an interesting character, one of many that populate this work. If you're looking for a unique read and a new author to explore, stop here. Recommended. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQCFV870G7SU/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590173252&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[John Sollami]

http://www.amazon.com/Death-sty-pigs-tale-novel/dp/039450867X/[Amazon]

*****
Death Sty: A Pig's Tale is an amazing, original, thought-provoking piece of fiction. I feel compelled to first say what this book is not: it is not an expose of the shocking cruelty taking place in slaughterhouses, nor is it a vehicle in which the author tries to convince you to become a vegetarian. This is basically a pig's story of his life and its grand purpose. This is no ordinary pig, however; he is a philosopher, political theorist, and sociologist blessed with amazing insight. Our unnamed narrator describes his current life inside a small enclosure at a slaughterhouse, referring back to his days of youth and continually looking forward to the day when his ultimate goal will be achieved. That ultimate goal is nothing less than his slaughter; he glories in the thought of his posthumous legacy as food for humankind. He devotes himself to forming the best hocks, ham, blood sausage, etc. He explains the course of his life, even providing a statistical chart showing his estimates of how much he weighed at each step of weaning, fasting, braking, etc. He knows full well what will happen to him when he reaches the butcher's domain, almost delighting in the communication of each step of the final process. Although he is alone throughout the course of his tale, he describes pig society, quotes famed pig thinkers, and laments those pigs who foolishly wish to make a mockery of their lives by resisting their glorious destinies. While he views the butcher as a god of sorts, he does have much to say about swineherds. He can barely tolerate these base men who see fit to come tramping nastily into his home any time they want and insist on putting his water bucket in the middle of his enclosure, where it naturally restricts his predilection for diagonal movement, rather than beside his trough. It is these same swineherds who have perpetuated so many lies about pigkind, he declares, while they are really the nasty beings who themselves, rather than hogs, live in sty-like squalor.

He expresses thoughts of rebelling against the swineherd, often in subtle ways, but he has no use for mass porcine action against man. This pig is basically a political thinker whose complex views often ring with religious overtones--after all, paradise for the pig is found at the hands of the butcher. He disdains those pigs too shallow to understand their true purpose. Most interestingly, he decries the thought of being taken out of his enclosure and being allowed outside--he would resist this by all means at his disposal, even though he has fond memories of a short time in the meadows as a young piglet. The thought of his brethren escaping the slaughterhouse is an affront to his sensibilities. Such an act betrays the very heritage of pigkind.

Clearly, this is political and social satire at a high level. One reading is not sufficient to truly understand everything the author is trying to communicate. The religious connotations immersed in the story are quite subtle and in no way offensive, but it is the pig's thoughts on politics and pig society that make this book so thought-provoking. I would say this is essentially a work of natural philosophy clothed in the guise of brilliant satire. Its originality, subtlety, and universality afford this short novel an honored position in my library of literary treasures. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7PX9M8O9LEN/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039450867X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Daniel Jolley]

*****
It's very, very odd; very, very imaginative and until this edition returned it to print, it was very, very hard-to-find.

Arthur Byron Cover's AUTUMN ANGELS is set in an Earth of the far, far future where, in the wake of some crisis that nearly wiped out humankind, the survivors were granted godlike powers by an alien race called the "bems." Through a lack of imagination (or possibly through the Machiavellian machinations of the Other Fat Man; see below), most of the residents have taken on archetypal identities culled from popular fiction. You might recognize some of them... for example, the fat man in his white suit seems reminiscent of a certain character played by Sydney Greenstreet in THE MALTESE FALCON; the lawyer has a loathing of pigs and a sword cane, just like Theodore Marley Brooks, better known as "Ham" from the Doc Savage novels; and the other fat man and his witty leg man could have stepped out of one of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories.

There are some wonderful literary games and joyful riffs on these pop archetypes... and there are wonderfully bizarre and imaginative journeys. You'll meet the Crawling Bird, the Cigar-Smoking Frogs, the green-furry ball creatures of the dullest planet in the universe, and the fish-with-legs who merely long to dance the night away.

It's all nailed together -- just barely -- by the story of the unlikely alliance of the lawyer, the fat man and the demon as they desperately attempt to rediscover Depression -- a state of mind long banished from the minds of godlike men, and one which the triumvirate believes is vital if the race is to ever rediscover a sense of purpose.

The book is filled with whimsical inventiveness and it frequently smash-cuts between phantastical fancies and more deeply thought, deeply felt moments. It's a wild trip, if one that has its flaws. (An artifact of the early '70s, it's filled with very peculiar little jokes and moments that must have seemed much more logical to a deeply stoned reader and/or writer.) But nonetheless, its mix of philosophy, fantasy and just plain fun makes it a natural fit for fans of books like GOOD OMENS (by Gaiman & Pratchett) and devotees of Douglas Adams' HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY books. (Its literary fun-'n'-games should also appeal to Philip Jose Farmer readers and fans of Alan Moore's LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN.)

The book has two "kind of" sequels by Arthur Byron Cover -- THE PLATYPUS OF DOOM & OTHER NIHILISTS (a collection of 4 novellas set in the same far future of AUTUMN ANGELS); and a more directly connected sequel, the truly excellent and deeply haunting AN EAST WIND COMING, which presents a darker vision of the world of godlike men: a reincarnation of Jack the Ripper stalks the Golden City, adding to a growing sense of malaise and despair, while the consulting detective slowly stirs from his torpor... - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEACXQUAII6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515037877&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Zothique]

*****
A dark, rich and unusual fantasy / science-fiction novel, this is Arthur Byron Cover's follow-up to Autumn Angels(recently reprinted) and the outrageously hard-to-find Platypus of Doom and Other Nihilists.

However, don't worry about reading them in order. AN EAST WIND COMING stands by itself and ably lays out the basic premise of the world. (I first read AN EAST WIND COMING years before I realized that it was actually part of a series.)

The story is set on a future Earth that has had its population decimated, but granted remarkable, godlike powers. With the ability to do anything, to become anyone -- they display a remarkable lack of imagination. Most of them have taken on personas drawn from literature and pop fiction and lead aimless lives of role-playing in an endless twilight of eternity.

The previous books in the series had a more playful, jaunty tone. Cover has great fun creating interactions between diverse figures clearly inspired by characters like Nero Wolfe, The Maltese Falcon's "Fat Man," the Wolfman, Lois Lane, lawyer Theodore Marley "Ham" Brooks (from the Doc Savage novels), Dashiell Hammett's Continental Op, Howard the Duck, Hawkman, Captain Marvel and various other creatures, demons and fabulous entities.

But here, things take a darker and more serious turn. The Golden City of the Godlike Men is haunted by a murderer -- possibly a reincarnation of Jack the Ripper. As the utopian streets run with blood, the godlike men face the ultimate crisis of their aimless, drifting existence. The murders seem to expose the underlying corruption and pointlessness of their existence. And the only hope seems to be to rouse the Consulting Detective (Sherlock Holmes) from his torpor, to finally investigate a new case that could change the nature of the godlike men's world.

It's a rich, fascinating book that takes diverse turns down many corridors -- introducing us to many of the godlike men as they wrestle with the problem of what to do in a universe where infinite power and infinite possibilities all too often lead to infinite despair.

The literary fun-'n'-games should appeal to fans of Alan Moore's LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN or anyone who's explored the Wold-Newton playground of Philip Jose Farmer. But there's a wholly unique and utterly fascinating quality to this lonely, haunted, elegiac novel. Again and again, Cover defiantly mines new meaning and hidden power from the detritus of junk, pop, pulp culture. This lost classic of fantasy richly deserves to be rediscovered. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R6JYR3YFISET6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425044394&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Zothique]

*****
William J. Craddock (1946 - 2004) was a gifted writer who only published two novels in his lifetime: 1970's "Be Not Content" and this novel, "Twilight Candelabra," from 1972, only published in a trade paperback edition. He wrote several other novels, including a sequel to "Be Not Content," but none of them were published. I assume this was due to publishing house politics, as Craddock's books, despite not racking up the sales, were at least well-received by critics. "Be Not Content" was given a favorable write-up in Rolling Stone (which was a counterculture bible in 1970, so the message was getting out to the right people), and it was influential to several writers, among them Rudy Rucker and William Gibson.

"Be Not Content" was an autobiography posing as a novel, the ultimate sixties counterculture novel, about a former biker getting involved in the brand-new LSD scene. It was filled with memorable characters and imaginative "tripping" scenes, a sense of reality - you knew Craddock had experienced all of these things first-hand. "Twilight Candelabra" is a different beast. This book is darker, shorter, harder edged, and not nearly as good. It has a lot of problems, but a lot of redeeming qualities as well. In short, it shouldn't have been Craddock's last-published novel. It should've been his "Crying of Lot 49," his second-novel "misfire" (as Pynchon considers "Lot 49"), a stopgap between "Be Not Content" and its sequel "Backtrack" (still unpublished, but according to Craddock twice the length of "Content").

"Twilight Candelabra" is like a counterculture "Exorcist." It rides on the occult vibe that swept over the US in the early seventies, namedropping everything from the Goetia to Crowley's rumored last words ("I am perplexed." Though, according to the Crowley bio "Perdurabo," this rumor is hogwash). Spliced in with the occult "readings" and demon talk is a lot of stoner wisdom, drug usage, psychedelic trips featuring Burroughsian stream-of-conscious writing, cops getting killed, kinky sex, and a bunch of characters ending all of their sentences with "man."

The book opens with a rambling, stream-of-conscious "Preface" in which Craddock mentions how everyone thinks he should get a "real job" and not try to write for a living. He then claims the novel is overly offensive and warns away sensitive women. As if to prove this, the novel itself begins with twenty-four year old hero Damon Dusk sodomozing a young boy, then pulling a .45 on the kid and telling him he's "morally obligated" to kill him.

The core problem with the novel is Dusk himself. A bad-attitude guy with shoulder-length black hair and a full beard (suspiciously much like the photo of William Craddock on the back cover), Dusk has gotten over his head in some serious occult business. The novel covers only a few weeks of action; Dusk - a new name, as the character re-invents himself periodically with a new name and background - suspects two demons are on his tail, and tries all manner of actions to get rid of them. But the thing is, Dusk is too inhuman a character to like. He's like those superhuman characters Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in the eighties - always two steps ahead of everyone, perfect in all ways, unstymied by such simple human troubles as worry and fear and compassion. We watch dumbstruck as Dusk exploits any and all characters he comes across, abusing them physically and verbally, engendering the deaths of innocents, ruining the lives of many, yet never once feeling any remorse. This would work if Dusk was an anti-hero, a villain in the starring role, but he's not; Craddock presents Dusk to us as the hero of the tale.

Instead of a cohesive plot, the book follows Dusk as he tries to figure out what's pursuing him, going from person to person. In this way the novel is much like early Don DeLillo. As stated, Dusk is always at least a step ahead, and unfortunately this includes the reader. So we have no idea WHY Dusk does the things he does, plans the things he plans, because Craddock won't let us in his head to find out. Instead, we are spectators, and this reduces the novel to the level of a film, where you can only watch the characters but never experience their feelings directly.

The majority of the scenes take place in the dilapidated house of Herwoman, a 400 pound witch who gives Dusk readings, provides him with grimoires, and in turn uses his body to serve her womanly needs. It's at Herwowan's house that the novel's first extended drug trip takes place; Dusk drinks a concoction of Herwoman's which contains a cornucopia of drugs. As in "Be Not Content," Craddock uses the drugs angle as an excuse to go wild with his writing, tossing in non sequitirs and turns-of-phrase that would have William Burroughs red with envy. Despite the drugged voyage into innerspace, Dusk receives no answers, so is still clueless about his shadowy pursuers. So he arranges a drug deal. Why? No idea, he just does. He takes advantage of the hero worship a young guy has for him by commandeering the guy's place, putting his life in jeopardy, and having him arrange this drug deal. Then Dusk takes advantage of the guy's fiancé...right in the guy's bed. After which he tells the girl to get herself together and keep her mouth shut. Yep, that's our hero.

The drug deal turns out to be a scam, as Dusk sells his criminal customers battery acid rather than bona fide drugs. Again, why there's even a drug deal is a question the novel doesn't bother to answer. I can only assume it's because Emma Oyama, a disfigured Japanese businesswoman who's really a demon in disguise, is an associate of the guy Dusk wants to screw over in the deal, and Craddock wanted to introduce her in an action-packed way. Regardless, the deal only serves to set up a few action scenes, none of them resolving much of anything.

After this Dusk suddenly decides he wants revenge upon a former acquaintance, a fellow dabbler in the black arts named Sampah. Why? You've got me. I figure it's because Dusk assumes Sampah has set those elusive demons on Dusk's back. In order to achieve this planned murder, Dusk first meets a group of revolutionaries, buying some bombs from them. Here Dusk tells the revolutionaries their future, informing them in flat tones what exactly will happen to them if they proceed with their plan to blow up a factory. He even reveals that one of their members is an undercover agent; they frisk the guy, and sure enough he's got a "signed photo of J. Edgar Hoover" in his wallet. How Dusk can predict the future and how Dusk knows all is again something Craddock doesn't explain.

After reuniting with a former girlfriend and witnessing the suicide of another former acquaintance, Dusk heads out into the desert where he frolics with a commune of wild women and their Herculean master who torture and then murder a cop. The commune is near Sampah's guarded encampment; after an unsuccessful assassination attempt, in which Sampah escapes with his life, Dusk is a man possessed (so to speak), finally alive, finally with a goal to achieve. This serves to make the character more human, but it's too little, too late.

As the novel races for its conclusion (the only conclusion it CAN have, given its hero's actions throughout), Craddock piles on the dark humor. One chapter features an extended sequence of Dusk about to face death from an armed pursuer, only for the pursuer to be killed by yet another armed pursuer, who in turn is killed by another pursuer right before the coup de grace, and on and on. It's almost Simpsonsesque, but jarring in the context of the book. The final chapter salvages things somewhat, a metaphysical look at life, death, and reincarnation, but I can only wonder how much better it would be if the novel preceding it had packed the same amount of emotion.

Again, it's a shame this is all we ever got from Craddock. Despite my problems with "Twilight Candelabra," it does have some great writing. I'm convinced it influenced Pynchon; parts of the drug trips seem identical to those fractured bits at the end of "Gravity's Rainbow," when Slothrop steps outside of the narrative. Craddock's writing is strong, literary yet accessible. My only complaint is his use of adverbs; the writer in me hates the sight of them. They're strung throughout the book, augmenting verbs that would do just fine on their own. He also has a tendency to break up dialog with unnecessary modifiers; lots of "Dusk said" and "she said" after every line of dialog, even when there are only two characters speaking.

Special mention should be made of the packaging. The book sports a blacklight-poster-in-waiting cover of a Day-Glo demon ripping open its chest to reveal an angel inside (a clue to the novel's moral). Even better is the appendix. Craddock has a series of questions and revelations at the end of the book, my favorite being:

A Suggested Question Concerning "Twilight Candelabra:"

Why?

There's also a list of "Sixteen Sexual Acts Performed Or Mentioned In Twilight Candelabra," as well as "Nine Causes Of Death To Be Found In Twilight Candelabra." It all reminds me of the Appendices in RAW/Shea's "Illuminatus!", only a bit more revelatory in some aspects (perhaps foreseeing that his book would be ignored, Craddock took it upon himself to give "Twilight Candelabra" a critical analysis, pointing out "Some Suggested Considerations"). In other words, the sort of thing which should've guaranteed the novel a cult badge of honor, but it was ignored, as was its author.

Craddock's widow has a website in which she requests publishers to contact her, if interested in reprinting her husband's novels. Here's hoping someone does - he's yet another forgotten sixties author who deserves another chance at the spotlight. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2057K54DNK68E/[Joe Kenney]

Crawford, Stanley
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Gascoyne]]
*Gascoyne* (1966)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Gascoyne-Stanley-Crawford/dp/1585677396/[Amazon]

*****
Stanley Crawford's 1966 novel "Gascoyne" is the sort of book that hooks you on the first page. Not only that, it grabs you and runs away with such momentum that, at least for the first 100 pages of the novel, you almost don't want to blink. The bizarre anti-hero of the book, Gascoyne, at first appears to be a private detective but then, maybe, a fiendish uber-capitalist bent on something like world domination. Not only that, Gascoyne seems to be not entirely human. He passes weeks at a time in his car, contrives to always go double the speed limit in a traffic-choked city, runs a huge company with only a handful of employees knowing him by sight, and manages to thrive on a diet of Ritz crackers, sardines, and chocolate bars.

The book is a dark, modern satire on the order of "Dr. Strangelove" or DeLillo's "White Noise." The doggedly-bleak, burlesque tone sometimes becomes wearying, but usually you'll go ahead and laugh at the jokes (whether you feel good about it or not) because Crawford allows you no choice in the matter. Take the following passage in which Gascoyne spies on a misbehaving wife, just recently widowed. Gascoyne climbs a ladder, looks in a window, and:

"First there's the Widow Roughah stretched out on the bed naked as all hell and second more or less on top of her is the hairy-chested fake giant tree sloth, and I think some people sure like to butter their bread funny. I always thought there was more than meets the eye in that woman and now I know what. But I really feel sorry for the poor b*stard inside the sloth suit which must smell like twenty-nine jockstraps in a pressure cooker. But maybe he likes that, you never know."

As wild a ride as "Gascoyne" is, there is something that brings it down in the end. Crawford's error comes in allowing his deep cynicism to infect his storytelling technique. It really seems that Crawford felt that things weren't worth tying together, even in a marginal way, and that he just stopped writing when he got bored with the character. So, when all is said and done, the book leaves enough loose ends cluttering up the landscape to make you feel not only irritated but a bit ripped off. If a little more care had been taken with the ending, the novel might have ranked with other counter-culture classics of the period, such as the novels of Rudolph Wurlitzer and Richard Brautigan. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R341MYO4E66AT8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585677396&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

I'm sure that there's a world where in 100 years, students writing scholarly dissertations about fantasy novels will come across this book and address it as a fine example of subgenre. At that point, it may gain cult status, who knows?

I had to give this book one extra star for sheer creativity-- whether it was the farm-wife who was (*ahem*) extra-close to her sheep or whether it was the cruddy curse of the human king, Cullen clearly doesn't have a problem with his imagination.

The plot was tedious, nothing more than an excuse to feature the various anatomical ways that elves, dwarves, deer, sheep, humans, and chickens (this is not an exaggeration) can interact. Even the erotica had very little virtue except a clearly vivid imagination behind it.

Champions of the very strange may get something out of this. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RQCE7X9V4IUMK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067182256X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[frumiousb]

*Fantastic Mister Fox* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142410349/[Amazon]

*****
There seems to have been a major shift in children's literature recently, thanks, of course, to the pre-eminence of Harry Potter. The latter is a hero parents can be proud of - bespectacled, middle-class, studious: the subtext is education is fun, enlightening and empowering.

The major children's writer before JK Rowling was Roald Dahl, who boasted few of these virtues, offering children cruel wit, and a morbid, often murderous mistrust of parents, adults, education and authority in general. He also implied that children could be malevolent and destructive. Parents hated him - I had to discover Dahl through friends; my mum bought me Enid Blyton. There was always the thrilling feeling that you were doing something illicit or conspiratorial reading Roald Dahl.

The hero of 'Fantastic Mr Fox' is a thief, a violater of property and business, and a murderer and torturer of animals, traits unlikely to endear him to the English middle classes. On the other hand, he rejoices in family values, still endearingly in love with his wife, and a great father. Under impossible odds, he tries to save his family and a host of other animals from the cruelty of three vile farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean, who are sick of the varmint's nocturnal sorties for their produce.

First they try to shoot him, but only pepper his tail (a deliciously gruesome episode). Next they dig into his tunnel, but he can dig faster. They use huge mechanical diggers, turning a hill into a valley. They try to starve him, surrounding the area with weapon-wielding minions.

The story of 'Fox' is very simple with few twists and turns. The impact, however, can be traumatic, and not just for young children - I read this to my wife (as you do), and we both got very anxious for our heroes, faced with the terrifying industrial might of the farmers. The irony of the story is ecological - while trying to save a few goods for business, the farmers nearly destroy the countryside and an entire animal network; the fox can only do what is natural, which is steal and kill (to which Dahl is faithful with admirable unsentimentality). The image of the three farmers waiting, possibly forever, at the hole for the fox to starve, is chilling and close to Beckett.

Once again, Dahl gets a great deal of pleasure in frightening his young audience, and his way with alliterative insults is as delightful as ever, while Quentin Blake's scribbles, though not part of the original book, are now so synonymous with Dahl's world, it's impossible to imagine it without them. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D08JTOUY4GGG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142410349&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[darragh o'donoghue]

*A Night of Serious Drinking* (?)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/A-Night-Of-Serious-Drinking/dp/1585673994/[Amazon]

*****
A Night of Serious Drinking is among Rene Daumal's most important literary works. Like his more widely read Mount Analogue, it is a work of symbolic fiction that can be enjoyed purely as an entertaining and imaginative story, but also for its much deeper meaning embedded in its deceptively simple plot: an unnamed narrator spends an evening getting drunk with a group of friends. As the party becomes intoxicated and more and more exuberant, the narrator embarks on a journey ranging from seeming paradises to the depths of pure hell.

The fantastic world depicted in A Night of Serious Drinking is actually the ordinary world turned upside down. The characters are called the Anthographers, Fabricators of Useless Objects, Scienters, Nibblists, Clarificators, and other absurd titles. Yet the inhabitants of these strange realms are only too familiar: scientists dissecting an animal in a laboratory, a wise man surrounded by his devotees, politicians and poets expounding their rhetoric. These characters perform hilarious antics and intellectual games, which they see as serious attempts to find freedom and meaning.

Daumal's keen perceptions about the human condition infuse this fable with a critique of culture and consciousness that is both disquieting and enlivening. The author presents a clear, truthful language in which intense human warmth establishes and commingles two elements too often apart - poetic fervor and philsophical insolence.

To note that Daumal was a philosopher, anovelist and a scholar of religion and Sanskrit. He was mostly renowed for his avant-garde poetry which appeared in the widely read Le Grand Jeu, a literary journal he founded as a correlate movement to Surrealism.

The novelist wrote to "lead people out of the black hole of depression which our age gravitates towards, because there is light in the heart of love that steers clear of it."

A line of indelible strength struk me as hilarious and frightening as did the fictive deliberatons in their entirety. The narrator finds himself overstepping the the demarcation of intoxication and announces as he stands at the threshhold: "There are only three exits here: madness and death." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VF848FABYZQF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585673994&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Luca Graziuso and Marina Ross]

*****
The Other Nineteenth Century is the third recent hardcover collection of a selection of Avram Davidson's short fiction, after The Avram Davidson Treasury (1998) and The Investigations of Avram Davidson (1999). Needless to say this is very welcome -- perhaps a reissue of the complete Eszterhazy stories (rumoured to be in the works), and a first collection of the complete Limekiller stories, and maybe one more collection of excellent leftover pieces would be nice. This collection is theoretically of stories set in some version or other of the 19th Century, though a few stories are actually set in the 20th Century, and one or two may be set in the 18th or earlier. But no point quibbling.

The collection is marvelous. It displays Davidson's trademark wonderfully discursive prose, and his autodidact-style erudition, and his deep interest in the nooks and crannies of history. The stories span pretty much Davidson's whole career. Among the best: "What Strange Stars and Skies", about a virtuous do-gooder woman ministering to people in the slums of London who runs afoul of "that unspeakably evil Eurasian, Motilal Smith". "The Lineaments of Gratified Desire" aka "The Price of a Charm", about a man in the early part of this century deciding whether to buy a love charm or a hunting charm -- with significant results. "The Montavarde Camera" is a spooky story about a man with a nagging wife who buys the title camera only to learn its terrible power. The rather late "Twenty-Three", in which we slowly learn the horrible secret of an old family. Another late story, "El Vilvoy de las Islas", about a strange man living on a remote South African island. One of the last (perhaps it was the last) Eszterhazy stories, "The Odd Old Bird", more of a jape than anyhing. "Dragon Skin Drum", a dark story about two American servicemen in China, and Mao's revolution, and the ignorance of Westerners. And so on, and so on ... excellent excellent stuff. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCRA3DADTJXRD/[Richard R. Horton]

I am so thrilled to see some of Avram Davidson's work coming back into print! I sincerely hope that this author finds new readers thanks to the work of publishers like this one keeping his work alive. I first stumbled upon a story of his in an anthology (from the '70's), and his story stood out as the most creative and intriguing piece in the book. Since then, I've sought out and found his stories in many anthologies dating from the 60's to hisdeath in the early 90's, as well as several of his novels, and incredible story collections. Although he has written some masterful novels such as 'Phoenix and the Mirror', I prefer his style in the short form. He has a unique imagination and an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure history, world literature, & mythology, all on full display in this wonderful book.

This is a fascinating collection of essays and quasi-historical entries, assembled in a somewhat encyclopedic format, a reference book for bizarre literature. It chronicles the missing parts of history, the strange bits that should have happened. There are entries and essays about mysterious and fantastic creatures, mythical lands, bizarre psudo-scientific discoveries, and other rather dubious information about a broad variety of obscure subjects. I think this particular book reads a bit like the labyrynthine works of Borges if he had written while on hallucinogens... This book may have inspired the form of the recent 'Thackerey T. Lambshead pocket guide to ... diseases,' or at least I feel that these two books go together well. Davidson is an absolutely unique talent, but I think this book should appeal to fans of Jeff VanderMeer and the Leviathan anthologies, Kelly Link, Neil Gaiman (who has mentioned his admiration for Davidson), Jeffrey Ford, Gene Wolfe, & R. A. Lafferty (another slightly obscure writer whose oddball work I love).

I have been hoping for years for a publisher to re-print this book so I could round out my Davidson collection. 'Adventures in Unhistory' was originally released in 1993, only in a limited collector's edition, which has gone on to become this author's most sought-after work, selling for many hundreds of dollars when it rarely does exchange hands... It has obtained a some-what legendary status, particularly among other authors of speculative fiction who occasionally cite it as a reference or influence, or just let slip in interviews that they own a coveted copy. An essay from this book inspired the idea behind Vonda MacIntyre's novel 'The Sun and the Moon.' Peter Beagle (who introduces this edition) has listed this as a favorite book, and Neil Gaiman has mentioned it on his blog. The original publisher, Owlswick, published a companion volume, 'The Adventures of Dr. Esztehazy,' which also first came out in a limited edition, as well as a cheaper HC edition, also illustrated by George Barr. I highly recommend seeking out this companion book as well, if you like this volume.

If this happens to be your first exposure to Davidson's work, and you want more (you will), or you are looking for a more general introduction to his writing, I highly recommend the 'Avram Davidson Treasury', which is a generous collection of stories from every period and genre which he worked in, including work from this volume, with appreciative essays by the greats of speculative (fantasy) fiction. That collection provides a great overview of his short work. I recommend these great story collections to any reader interested in imaginative fiction. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI8KVV1XOOAQR/[Xtopher Xtopher]

*****
This is my first experience with Leslie Purnell Davies, who, it turns out, was fairly prolific through the sixties and seventies in the mystery and science-fiction field, but was also a bit of a mystery himself. No matter, interested readers can search him out on the web to find out more as I did, or refer to S. T. Joshi's The Evolution of the Weird Tale and read the chapter devoted to Davies, which is where I first heard of him, if they are curious. I was surprised that I *hadn't* heard of him before--I've spent a lot of time browsing through stacks of science-fiction paperbacks, and the name never rang a bell.

TWILIGHT JOURNEY (1967) may not be Davies's best work (Who is Lewis Pinder? seems to get a lot of print: AKA Man out of nowhere) but it was an interesting start. According to Mr. Joshi, the common theme running through all of Davies's work is identity; the main character is usually unsure of who he really is. TWILIGHT JOURNEY follows that general idea, to a point; the inventor of a device that can script your dreams infiltrates the project he left behind years before, posing as a student undergoing a dream tutorial. Initially, in his dream, he is lost and confused, and it is only as the book goes on that both the reader and the dreamer discover his real purpose.

Davies actually writes well--not a given in the science-fiction field--and his idea in TWILIGHT JOURNEY is pretty good, though it's been revisited many times since. In fact, the book reminded me of a mash-up of The Matrix and 1984, and I think many readers will also be tempted to compare Davies with Phillip K. Dick as well, though without as much paranoia and schizophrenia. That's probably a fair comparison (though with only one reading it's hard to be sure), though I don't think Davies spun out his storylines as far as Dick was willing to--sometimes even to the detriment of the point he was trying to make. As far as TWILIGHT JOURNEY, I kept expecting more twists that never came, and I thought Davies could have really wound the reader up with the premise he set up, but failed to maximize the potential.

Still, I give the book reasonably high marks--I really wanted to like it, and I did, so take that into consideration when looking at my rating. I do look forward to reading him again, to see if he is a little more risky in his plot, but TWILIGHT JOURNEY was still an enjoyable read. I'm glad I finally found out about him--better late than never--and already have The Artificial Man in my stack of to-be-read-sooner-rather-than-later books. That's about as good of a recommendation as I can give. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQI9CQ0NPZNU/[Amazon]

*****
The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas is a playful, metafictional novel that immediately brings to mind Laurence Sterne's Tristam Shandy. It is "Posthumous" for the simple reason that to write his whole life's story, a man must wait until he is dead so the story is complete. He begins by telling us of his death in his native Brazil, in 1869, at the age of 64--a childless bachelor, so we know ahead of time the fruitless outcome of the love affairs which will dominate his memoirs.

Going back to his beginnings, Brás Cubas describes his ancestry--how he manages to be rich enough never to have to work in his life--and his spoiled childhood. Brás is barely grown before he is squandering a fortune on trinkets for a favorite prostitute. His indulgent father, finally losing patience with him, sends Brás to Europe to finish his education. Returning after having barely eked out a degree, he refuses a career in politics and the marriage his father has arranged to the beautiful Virgília. But then, as soon as Virgília has been wed to someone else, Brás falls madly in love with her.

Brás Cubas, in short, is a no-account dandy whose life is noteworthy only for the trouble he causes those who persistently care for him. His life history would be a dreary novel, except that the novel isn't so much about Brás as about the story itself. The narrator regularly steps back from the narrative to address the reader as audience, accomplice, or adversary. At one point he laments:

"I'm beginning to regret this book. Not that it bores me, I have nothing to do and, really, putting together a few meager chapters for that other world is always a task that distracts me from eternity a little. But the book is tedious, it has the smell of the grave about it; it has a certain cadaveric contraction about it, a serious fault, insignificant to boot because the main defect of the book is you, reader. You're in a hurry to grow old and the book moves slowly. You love direct and continuous narration, a regular and fluid style, and this book and my style are like drunkards, they stagger left and right, they walk and stop, mumble, yell, cackle, shake their fists at the sky, stumble and fall..."

He describes his book very well. There are chapters with typographical flourishes such as dialogue consisting of nothing but punctuation marks, a chapter with a title and no text, and chapters that are simply brief soliloquies. Sometimes Brás pats himself on the back, saying things like "By God, that's a good way to end a chapter!" At another point he suddenly interrupts himself to go back and clarify something from several chapters earlier, closing with "Good Lord! Do I have to explain everything?"

The result is a delightful little satirical novel with all its moving parts fully exposed and vividly painted so reader and author can have a good laugh at one another. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D3ZB3SI2Z2F4/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195101707[Steven Davis]

[[The_War_of_Don_Emmanuels_Nether_Parts]]
*The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts* (1997)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-War-Emmanuels-Nether-Parts/dp/0375700137/[Amazon]

*****
In this opening salvo of a trilogy on Colombian society and politics, de Bernieres demonstrates his outstanding abilities. His descriptive powers are vivid, often chilling, in conveying what humans are capable of perpetrating on one another. He produces characters that prance over the pages in a tantalising dance, challenging you to predict their next outrage or fallacy. The story is intricately woven through a loom of surprises, tragedies, and disasters. There are light moments, but they leave you wondering what depth of misfortune is likely to follow. Lest this analysis leave you feeling the book is depressing, take heart. The author portrays solemn realism, but swifts and butterflies of hope and satisfaction will reward the reader, even if their passage seems evanescent.

The "war" is more than simply the manifestations of one man's loins. Don Emmanuel is but one soldier in a wider context. De Bernieres is here campaigning for a broader sense of justice than this semi-imaginary society has been experiencing. What is the justice in a village gathering to defend a local, perhaps the last, virgin from salacious soldiers, only to have a grenade slaughtering the inhabitants. The army, supposedly called up to defend the nation, proves its most rapacious element. How to halt their depredations becomes the focus of this intricately woven tale. In one deliciously described sally, the village uses a local, well, "experienced", young women to visit the army's camp with her charms - and infections, such as neisseria [google it!].

This thinly disguised tale of modern Columbia's stresses depicts a society topped by an oligarchy of vested interests. "Right" and "Left" are but easily swopped labels by elements that have no essential differences. The "natural rulers" are buttressed by a compliant church, which is far more concerned with its own interests than that of the resident peasantry. This agrarian foundation of the country, who have little enough for themselves, occupy remote villages while underpinning the urban society. They are ready victims, easily manipulated or simply ignored. Their attackers are many and defenders few - yet it is typical of de Bernieres' sense of irony that among their champions stands an Army General.

That de Bernieres has copped many awards is adequate testimony to his prowess. He entertains and informs with equal verve. A dash of fantasy added to this story brings home the fact that "religion" is a term requiring expanded definition. The new definition would encompass human feelings more intimately than our present models. Death, never welcome, becomes something less than absolute in this author's hands. If the images he depicts are but our memories of lost loved ones, perhaps we should spend more time celebrating them. These and other questions permeate this book while prompting us to confront and judge our own values. If that's de Bernieres' intent, he's succeeded admirably. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QAQERXK1NU6A/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375700137[Stephen A. Haines]

*Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord* (1998)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Senor-Vivo-Coca-Louis-Bernieres/dp/0375700145/[Amazon]

*****
Since first reviewing "Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord" for Amazon my opinion has changed substantially, and it is only fair to pass this on.

I stand by my original thought that this book suffers from the post-modernity malaise: The author has brought together almost too many ideas, styles and techniques in the service of his agenda - at certain points these tend to obscure rather than clarify things. However, the depth of the message and the beauty of its expression have become clearer over time.

The message is simultaneously uplifting and painful: There is a grim symbiosis that unites corrupt and stupid governments with drugs and arms dealers in a feeding frenzy that destroys not just people but civilisation itself. Love and justice can be victorious, but only the kind of love that has more to do with self-sacrifice than romance, and only the kind of justice that is prepared to confront evil regardless of the cost. It's a profound but painful truth that only that strange hybrid of Marxism and Christianity called "Liberation Theology" has succeeded in developing systematically.

The book's principal stylistic flourish is "magical realism", a formula familiar to readers of Garcia Marquez and others. This piece of lit. crit. jargon means simply that magical events are an integral part of the plot, but, this being the world of po-mo, it only happens to make a point. In other words, the author does not require you to suspend disbelief as would be the case in a conventional magic story. This technique provides the opportunity for some of the book's most delicate and beautiful images, but on the downside it imposes a clumsy constraint on the author: He cannot narrate supernatural events directly and objectively - he has to do so in a subjective way from inside the head of one of his characters. This is not a criticism of the author - he executes this perceptual juggling with flawless technique. Rather, it is an indictment of the literary fashion that makes this sort of mannerism necessary. The self-distancing of the author from the world in which his characters live and move is unavoidably communicated to the reader, making it harder to engage with the characters or feel for them the way we would under the spell of a conventional narrative.

In this literary framework, only appalling suffering can draw us into the intensity of feeling for the characters that is necessary for the device to work. The story starts off in a light, satirical vain that will raise genuine rueful smiles and in its erotic moments even perhaps mildly titillate. The only searching question is whether he can reign the po-mo mannerisms in for long enough at a time to keep the story flowing, but Louis writes such beautiful prose that it is a pleasure to read. Nevertheless, the feelgood factor of the earlier chapters cannot last, and quite quickly the book descends into a nightmare of depraved violence. Louis narrates rape, torture, mutilation and so on with exactly the kind of elegant simplicity you would expect, and after the good humour of the early chapters the result is almost unbearably shocking.

I have some reservations as to whether even great literature should incorporate such graphic descriptions of sexual violence. I would certainly not wish to leave this book lying around the house where a young or impressionable person could be exposed to it. And in places Louis' literary technique almost gets the better of his artistic sensibility. Nevertheless, it stands as a remarkable achievement by a novelist of extraordinary gifts. If you are not afraid to laugh, cry and be sickened in one sitting, it is strongly recommended. - http://www.amazon.com/review/ROYVDUJBJ8A6S/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375700145&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[J.

http://www.amazon.com/The-Troublesome-Offspring-Cardinal-Guzman/dp/0375700153/[Amazon]

*****
De Bernieres, who wrote the magnificent "Corelli's Mandolin" (see my review below, 1/99), has hit upon another culture in another fantasy. The Troubling Offspring is a wild convoluted tale involving the bizzare characters of, primarily, Cochadebajo (de los Gatos), an imaginary Andean pueblo. De Bernieres, who spent many years in Columbia, has managed to build a tragicomedy involving all of those very real aspects of the South American existence: screwy and corrupt politics, the screwy and corrupt church, and a certain amount of mysticism. The plot begins when the Cardinal decides that another Inquisition is due for the heathens of the mountain villages. The Cochedebajeros (described as a collection of "macho philosophers, defrocked priests, and slightly reformed prostitutes cohabiting in 'cheerful' anarchy") use some of the strangest ammunition imaginable to fight off the holy crusaders. The humor in this novel strikes at every turn, with chapters entitled, for example, "In which his Excellency, President Veracruz, wins the General Election without rigging it too much," or, "In which Felicidad's Gyrating backside Provokes Hostilities, " or, "An Apocalypse of Embarrassment Strikes the City," Oh, like much of De Bernieres, this book is a silly romp through what might otherwise be a serious subject. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMMNZGNWIHYI9/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375700153[R.

*****
Fans of De Marinis's earlier works will recognize bits and pieces of Guido Tarkenen, the central character of "A Clod of Wayward Marl"--Italian on his mother's side, Finnish on his father's, with a fondness for drink and a tendency toward bad trouble with women, he could be a grow-up cousin to Trygve Napoli, the protagonist of "The Year of the Zinc Penny," or to the adult heroes of any number of his short stories (see his superb collection "Borrowed Hearts"). Guido's a writer of "slasher trash" novels, temporarily teaching writing at La Siberia U., located in a border town bearing a close resemblance to El Paso. There's plenty of plot here, but the real pleasure of the book is De Marinis's gleeful genre-bending in his creation of Guido's demented little world--it's a little bit hardboiled P.I., a little technothriller, some academic comedy, with a little SF thrown in just for fun. (The book contains the best description of a virtual reality trip I've read anywhere, and it's funny to boot.) If there were any justice De Marinis would be one of the best-known writers in America, and if enough people sit up and notice this one, maybe he will be. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3FLU736T8J6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIGQWJC&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text[robert phillips]

*****
The Riancey Amendment passed into law in France on July 16, 1850 and imposed a serial novel tax on newspapers, charging one centime per copy of any newspaper that included an installment of a serial novel. The law was based on the belief that serial novels had been responsible for fomenting subversive ideas. Gérard de Nerval's The Salt Smugglers is, in large part, a response to this law.

Awarded with a commission for a historical serial novel, Nerval's plans were thwarted by the new law. Instead of a novel, he undertakes to write a history of the life of the abbé de Bucquoy, a historical figure of questionable authenticity. This endeavor proves to be difficult, and the work devolves into the story of a quest for information as Nerval visits numerous libraries and historical sites in and around Paris, encountering many adventures and colorful characters along the way (though all the while insisting "Have no fear,--this is not a novel.") Nerval's "history" is mostly composed of diversions, including the story of the failed romance of one of the abbé's relatives. Other diversions have even less connection to the abbé, like Nerval's examination of "the musical possibilities of unrhymed verse" or his quotation of the eviction notice he receives when his apartment is expropriated for public purposes.

Not until three-fourths of the way through the book does Nerval get to the story of the abbé that he initially set out to tell. Although this delay is frustrating at times, the abbé's story is not the real point of The Salt Smugglers. Nerval's true purpose is to reveal the undefined the border between fact and fiction. Throughout his "history," Nerval scrupulously relies on actual sources, but he undermines those sources by exposing their questionable accuracy. Nerval also relates numerous anecdotes that are indistinguishable from fiction, always being careful to follow each one with a tongue-in-cheek avowal of its truth: "I don't know whether this simple story of a young lady and a pork butcher's son will prove to be entertaining for my readers. It at least has one thing going for it: it is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, entirely true." The overall effect is one of humorous, if distracted, subversion. The book's design--double columns of text recalling the newspaper columns in which The Salt Smugglers originally appeared--adds authenticity to the reading experience. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HTTP85CFSVC9/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0980033063&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[G.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140449000/[Amazon]

*****
I picked this book up on a whim, having a certain fondness for literary tales of thieves and con-men, and I was not disappointed. The forward of the book would give you the impression that the Spanish invented the picaresque novel, a point on which I would differ, given that Petronius' The Satyricon, which while not a novel per se, is still the very spirit of the picaresque literary theme and is older by far. Nonetheless, I found these two short novels both entertaining and surprisingly educational, showing us if nothing else that human motivations and susceptibility to temptation and trickery really never change. The cons and tricks employed by the "heroes" of both novels are easy to identify with, being as many are the Renaissance era equivalents of modern day identity theft and business fraud. And as smaller examples of the literary style of the time, they also fit well alongside the much more famous work of the period, Cervantes' Don Quixote, in both the feel of the culture of that time and place and of the universal traits of human nature that transcend time and place. The translation is well done and reads quite smoothly, even though as it notes in the foward that some jokes, puns and other comic references were so tied to the language and the time that only lengthy footnotes could attempt to explain them in context, which would have marred the readability considerably.

My only disappointment, and it is a minor one, is that The Swindler ends referring to a second volume which apparently was never written. This may have been intentional, a literary device of sorts. Or, since DeQuevedo never intended The Swindler to be published in the first place, and when it did appear, never claimed authorship, it may simply be that he never got around to writing the alluded-to second volume. Still, that aside, both short novels are worth reading for anyone who has a fondness for the picaresque or for pieces of that period of Spanish literature. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHOP3A4DWGCE/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140449000&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Whitt Patrick Pond]

http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2012/07/celestina-out-of-sky.html[Seraillon]

*****
"Celestina" is one of those literary peculiarities that you might not have had the pleasure to be introduced to if you had not taken a course in Spanish literature. I first ran across the title in the Dedalus European Classics series, which has a lot of similarly obscure and wonderful things, including Georges Rodenbach and Gustav Meyrink. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that a more mainstream publisher like Penguin had the same translation, by Peter Bush.

Celestina, the local procuress and alchemic mage, makes a living off of restoring the hymens of previously deflowered young girls so that they may be marriageable again. The rich noble Calisto has fallen in love with Melibea, yet it is wholly unrequited. He enlists Celestina to fix this, and through some crafty manipulation she eventually succeeds. Two of Calisto's servants, Parmeno and Sempronio, promise to offer their own services to Celestina if she will split Calisto's payment three ways. Parmeno starts out being honest, telling Calisto that Celestina is nothing but a money-hungry crook, but eventually gives up when he sees how hopelessly in love Calisto really is. Once Celestina refuses to pay them, everything starts to go horribly, horribly downhill. What read for the first two-thirds as a bawdy comedy turns into a bloodbath on par with "Hamlet." The label tragicomedy seems especially appropriate here, having equal measures of both.

The plot is fast-paced and easy to follow. It is divided into twenty-one short, heavily dialogue-driven chapters that read very much like a play (even though it was apparently never mean to be staged). Throughout, the best advice is given through numbing, stultifying bromides, and this is especially true of Celestina. You can almost open the book randomly and find clichés, though the humor of the characters still manages to jump off the page.

Simone de Beauvoir wrote a beautiful description of Celestina in "The Coming of Age." She wrote, "This was the first time that an old woman had appeared as the main heroine; in the traditional way she was of course a bawd, but a bawd of dimensions quite unlike those of any character who had yet been produced. She was a former whore who had stayed in the trade because she liked it, a self-seeking, lewd, and intriguing old woman, and something of a witch as well - the leading, most active character in the play [though play, as I noted above, is not the right word for this piece]. In her are summed up all the vices that had been attributed to the old women since classical times, and in spite of all her shrewdness she ends by being severely punished. The French theatre turned to this source of inspiration, but with less striking results: we find old bawds and prostitutes in Jodelle, Odet de Turnebe, and Larivey."

The reader gets the feeling that, when it was first published at the very end of the fifteenth century, "Celestina" was meant first and foremost to be a savage critique of the reigning morality of the time. While it has lost its critical punch, it is still full of characters, ideas, and bawdy that make it enjoyable, humane, and lovable. Since it was written before most modern-day genres had the chance to fully gel, the style takes getting used to; it cannot be easily pegged down, like we do more easily with Cervantes and Shakespeare, who in theme and style and both heavily foreshadowed here (especially the former).

I can't read Spanish, so I can't comment on the original. However, I can recommend Peter Bush's translation to anyone who is looking for a unique reading experience far off the beaten path. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y289QT8E54I3/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143106090&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Certain Bibliophile]

I've had my copy of this book in my library since the year 2000. It was given to me in India by a good friend, who told me it was amazing. He was right. I finally have gotten around to reading it after being initially put off for 9 years by its strangely eclectic language and thoroughly unconventional format. I have since learned that these are just two of this book's extraordinary strengths, as G.V. Desani demonstrates a fantastically freewheeling imagination and healthy creative disregard for traditional novelistic forms. He proceeds to structure his "chapters" like a scientific treatise. However, first he gives us a "Warning!": Dear reader, this isn't a novel, it's a "gesture," but if you can't relate to that, then call it a "novel." Then we are given a kind of preface, called "All About...", followed by ANOTHER "Warning!" and then a "Mutual Introduction." So now you know you're in for something completely different.

By page 39 of my Penguin Books edition, we get to the "chapters." Each one begins with a "Digest," which is a kind of Abstract summary that gives nothing away to the reader. These Digests need to be reread after "digesting" the actual chapter. Following the Digest is the "Instruction" section, which is what we are supposed to learn. Then comes a "Presumption" as to what is assumed by the writer as he goes about relating to us the actual "Life-Encounter" of H. Hatterr, which is the heart of the chapter.

Hatterr as a main character is a picaresque cultural mashup of western and eastern thought. He's a seeker and a cynic, a believer and an irreverent skeptic who finds more fraud and nonsense in the world than sincerity. The only sincere person is his loyal friend Banerrji, his Sancho Panza, who loves to quote little fragments from "the Bard" and other western literary icons. Adventure after wildly funny adventure only confirms Hatterr's outlook on life. Yet, genuine spiritual feelings also arise, but they usually are self-generated by Hatterr, not by the sages and gurus he encounters.

The language and style of Desani have clearly influenced other writers, such as Amitav Ghosh. I noticed a similarity between this seminal work and Ghosh's wonderfully freewheeling "Sea of Poppies." The language here is rich, funny, and entertaining. I found myself completely lost in its spell.

Without a doubt, I highly recommend this "novel," "gesture," or whatever you want to call it. Don't compare it to anybody or anything else. It stands up all on its own. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RGX1VL9DM49C6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140279172&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[John Sollami]

*****
The Tents Of Wickedness is a brilliantly written, seriously funny, often very touching novel.

Charles ('Chick') Swallow is happily married, and has yielded to his destiny as a writer of a question and answer column for the local newspaper of his hometown, Decency, Connecticut. Yet he has 'sudden, inexplicable forebodings - hunches that Life might not yet have made its peace with him'. On the day we meet him he has (while taking a bath) an 'intimation of unfinished business'.

As well he might. Over the next year he is put through an emotional whirlwind. A childhood playmate of his, Beth ('Sweetie') Appleyard - who has willingly remained, for all intents and purposes, a helpless child - is once again brought into his life. Ever the incorrigible knight-gallant, Charles recognises her poetic talent, assists in her emotional growth and quickly increasing sense of personal freedom.

He succeeds so well she has a book of poems published and soon is living the fast and loose bohemian life in Greenwich Village. When her father and grand-mother die in an aeroplane crash, leaving Beth apparently financially independent, she tires of the party life, decides she wants a child in order to be fulfilled - but without the burden of a husband - and sees Charles as being in the perfect position to give her one.

The resistance he puts up falls apart when he finds out the alternative to himself in Beth's plans is his brother-in-law, Nickie Sherman, whose marriage is very nearly on the rocks. Charles then nobly (in his mind) goes to bed with Beth to save his sister's and Nickie's marriage. The sub-plot, of Nickie Sherman's acquiring an alternative personality as a master-thief (due to more of Charles's 'help') is first-rate, almost surreal comedy.

Everything appears to have settled down somewhat when the crisis comes. Beth finds out she will not get the money she has been expecting, and quickly reverts almost to her original helpless self - clinging to Charles and terrifying him with the possibility of his wife realising what he has done and the loss of his two children and happy home life. Half out of his mind, he entertains the 'literary' idea of murdering her. He fantasizes hilariously a court-scene in which he is literally holding the baby while Beth succeeds in her denials the child is hers. Charles's attempts to have Beth abort the baby fails when she escapes from the clinic and returns to Decency, where Charles's wife, Crystal, finally discovers his unfaithfulness.

Throughout the novel De Vries has kept up an astonishing level of comic inventiveness, much of it playing off modern literature - Charles finds echoes of famous novels in every situation, liberal amounts of Beth's 'original' poetry appear, cleverly parodying famous poets. The novel is loaded with literary allusions, from Dreiser to Caldwell, Joyce and The New Testament. This has led up to the point in which Charles, now totally exposed and insane with guilt and grief, 'awoke from troubled dreams one morning to find that he had been transformed in his sleep into a great pig'. Kafka's Metamorphosis is brilliantly re-imagined as Charles sets about proving to himself - and his family - his new form and identity. It is genuinely masterful comic writing.

In the end all is well. Everyone is wiser and chastened - even Beth, who, in the novel's closing pages, married to a 'sales manager of a retail shoe corporation', is shown to be an accomplished and original writer, celebrating in seven poems convention and tradition.

This is one of the best-written, original and delightful novels I have ever read. Published in 1959, it is as current in its concerns as any modern novel. Everyone who loves literature in general and humorous writing in particular should read this book.

The title comes from the 84th Psalm: 'I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness'. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RDB08ASGN8FKF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5E57HY&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[peter d pipinis]

*The Simulacra* (1964)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Simulacra-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0547572506/[Amazon]

*****
Fueled by prescription amphetamines, and in a burst of creative effort rarely seen before or since in the sci-fi field, cult author Philip K. Dick, in the period 1963-64, wrote no less than six full-length novels. His 13th since 1955, "The Simulacra," was originally released as an Ace paperback in 1964 with a cover price of 40 cents. The book, written in Dick's best middle-period style, gives us a pretty whacky look at life in the mid-21st century. David Pringle, in his "Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction," aptly describes the work as "an overpopulated novel which flies off wildly in too many directions," and indeed, readers may need a flowchart to keep track with this one. According to my careful count, the book features no less than 56 named characters (not to mention several unnamed), and the manner in which Dick interweaves their stories in an ingenious manner is one of the book's main strengths.

In the crazy world that Dick depicts, the U.S. and Germany have merged to become the U.S.E.A.; the country is in awestruck love of First Lady Nicole Thibodeaux, who has somehow remained ageless for her 73 years in office (a character most likely based on then-First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy); giant drug and simulacra (think: robots identical to humans) cartels hold almost limitless power; northern California has turned into a "chupper"- (think: radiation mutant) filled rain forest as a result of atomic war; and the government is able to make use of the von Lessinger principle to travel backward and forward in time. Against this backdrop, Dick introduces us to some of his sympathetic "little people" with big problems. Dr. Egon Superb, the world's last practicing therapist, wonders why he alone has been allowed to continue, when all other practitioners have been outlawed. Brothers Vince and Chic Strikerock, employed at rival simulacrum companies, become caught up in a love triangle and government plots. Richard Kongrosian, a psychokinetic pianist on the verge of psychotic collapse, worries about his turning invisible, as well as his "phobic body odor." Nat Flieger, a record company exec, travels to northern California to record Kongrosian and observes the chupper community there. Bertold Goltz, street agitator and time-traveling radical, attempts to bring the government down. Ian Duncan and Al Miller, with their classical-music jug-band act, finagle a way to perform before the First Lady in the White House. And, in a sadly underdeveloped subplot, Nazi bigwig Hermann Goering is brought forward 100 years in an attempt to alter history. Somehow, Dick manages to keep all these story lines percolating and interweaving, throwing out interesting bits of speculation and background color along the way, such as insectlike advertisements that burrow into cars and homes to spread their annoying messages, and a machine to which penitant folks offers confessions (the "confessionator") that is more like a lie detector than anything else. The author's pet themes of deceitful governments, the real truth behind the apparent truth ("What's unreal and what's real?" Ian asks succinctly at one point, neatly summarizing just about the entire Dick oeuvre!), and the dubious merits of drugs are given major play here, and some of the author's pet passions, such as classical music (Dick, it should be remembered, managed a record store and programmed a classical music program for the radio in the early '50s) and cigars (a good dozen or so cigars are referred to by name throughout the novel), are strongly represented. Good as it is, "The Simulacra" is not a perfect work. Ultimately, the plottings of Goltz and of National Police head Wilder Pembroke are convoluted to the point of being impossible to fathom, several characters just kind of peter out (such as Israeli P.M. Emil Stark and "conapt" resident Edgar Stone), and the novel doesn't so much wrap up neatly as abruptly come to an end. Dick could easily have kept the multiple plot threads weaving for another few hundred pages here, had he so chosen, or written a nice sequel (a common temptation for most sci-fi authors, and one to which Dick never succumbed). Still, the book is compulsively readable, often very funny, endlessly imaginative and, in all, a real hoot. It has also managed to provide me with a line that may become my new catchphrase: "How are you going to work...that into your Weltanschauung?" - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2481W02X2G4EX/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572506[s.ferber]

*****
An explanation is necessary. As far as I can tell, there are no fewer than four versions of this book:

1) The first publication was one half of an Ace Two-in-one paperback (paired with Howard L. Cory's The Mind Monsters). This version is about 40,000 words in length. Originally, it appeared in the December 1964 issue of the magazine Fantastic. Ace Books originally requested additional material to extend the story to standard paperback novel length, but they didn't like what Philip K. Dick sent them.

2) Berkley Books published the entire book, including the additional material (which was written in 1965), in 1983. However, there was a catch: when Dick was reviewing this additional material, he saw that some pages were missing from the manuscript. To be exact, there were three brief gaps near the end of the work; the Berkley Books version (which is the one I read) included all of the additional information, noting where the gaps occur in the text.

3) Philip K. Dick did make an effort to make the two parts fit together a little better. In 1979, he rewrote Chapter 1, and made other minor changes, in an attempt to provide more continuity. However, he did not complete the three "gaps" near the end of the novel before his death in 1982. Dick's UK publisher, Gollancz, published a third version of the novel, hiring s/f writer John Sladek to write material to "bridge the gaps" in the novel's last pages. Gollancz published this book with the title Lies, Inc. in 1984.

4) The American version of Lies, Inc. was published after Dick's literary executor, Paul Williams, found the missing pages of The Unteleported Man / Lies, Inc. in 1985, while perusing some of Dick's other manuscripts. These missing sections are included in the 2003 edition of the book, published by Vintage. As Williams says, this is the book "as the author intended it in 1979, but necessarily without any further revisions he may have thought about making but never got around to."

But are any of these versions of the book any good? Well, as I said, I read the Berkley Books version, and, being a big fan of Philip K. Dick, did enjoy it enough to finish it. However, any reviewer should emphasize that the only version of this book that was ever in any sense "finished" was the first one. All of the longer versions of The Unteleported Man / Lies, Inc. are unfinished works and should be approached as such. Why? Well, the novel proceeds briskly through the first half or so, until the protagonist, Rachmael ben Applebaum, is attacked with a weaponized form of LSD. The prose style changes abruptly, the pacing of the novel changes, and reality itself is in flux for the remainder of the book. While I have no doubt that part of this is intentional on Dick's part (the man could do amazing things blurring the lines between reality, hallucination, and schizophrenia), the unfinished nature of the book makes it very difficult to follow. When Dick decides to add time travel to the plot for good measure, the book almost cries out for additional rewriting.

I give the book 3 stars, but only with the understanding that it is a fragment, with about half of the material published posthumously. A lot of the themes here were dealt with much better in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, which is arguably Philip K. Dick's best book. If you're looking to read everything the man wrote, you might want to start there. While The Unteleported Man / Lies, Inc. has Dick shedding new light on his favorite themes of What is Reality? and What is Human?, it makes a poor first choice by this author. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTGK0IHCRZ43/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042506252X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[B.

*****
I am frankly surprised that this book is so little understood. I will grant at the outset that the writing itself is not very distinguished for sophisticated literary palettes--but its greatness lies in the ideas that it casts into the tireless tropes of speculative fiction.

To begin with, he spins a cognitive framework of a world in perpetual war, waged by robots above the surface of the earth which has become too ravaged by radioactivity to support human life. Humans are reduced to living underground in "tanks", subterranean factories whose economy depends upon the constant repair of damaged robot warriors from the surface. The only source of information about this grim cognitive framework pipes in through the Television tube, where a Dear Great Leader sits behind the imposing desk of authority, surrounded by the symbols of state. He prattles about the sacrificies made by the millions surviving in the tanks, he talks about the struggles to build a free society on the surface, the despicable nature of the enemy, the threat to liberty, and so on and so forth. You get the picture. You have heard it yourself on the nightly news for years and years.

So the crisis comes when the chief mechanic for the tank grows desperately ill. Death is certain unless they can obtain an artificial organ transplant. How can they do that? They have no power, no initiatives available in this regard. If he dies, they will fall behind in their quota, their food rations will be cut, the lives of the entire tank are at stake. So in a desperate state they decide to send one of their own to the surface on a quest for an artificial organ. When he makes his way to the surface, he fears instant incineration from the death dealing warrior robots--instead, imagine his surprise as he discovers that the entire planet is a beautiful sunlit garden, inhabited not by fierce warrior robots and smoking ruins, but instead a privileged leisure class served by the robots in luxury, devoting their time to spinning little fearful fictions for the slaves laboring down below...

Recognise this world? You're living in it. For you are either a Yance man--one who writes speeches for the Dear Great Leader--that is to say a wise guy--an Illuminatus--or you are a subterranean slave--a know nothing. Which one are you?

Actually, Dick shows a third way in the form of a mysterious native American, a member of the new Aristocracy, who plays the role of Scarlet Pimpernel with a time machine, systematically and methodically working against the Status Quo--and working for the liberation of the armies of slaves living and working in the underground. For, after all, none of us are supposed to awake, but then again, sometimes some of us do. And What Then? Do we join these forces of authority, intent on the domination of the great unwashed masses--Or ,do we work for the improvement of their lot, freeing them with useful knowledge and the simple facts of existence? How do you successfully inform someone that they are living in chains if they have never had them off? How do you force someone to actually realize that yes, everything IS connected to everything--and no, there really IS no such thing as a free lunch?

Dick's story takes Plato's parable of the Cave and cloaks it in a futuristic scenario. He brings the mystical ideas of the neo-platonists to life. He creates a metaphor for the secret teachings of the Gnostic Christians. He hints that the great liberating figures of the story, the time traveller, may be the second coming of Christ, and implys that Christ may have been a time traveller himself.

These are the grandest notions of bondage by ignorance vs liberation through knowledge, the salvation and healing available through simple practical truths. The story demonstrates clearly the workings of the "Authoritarian Mind", using fear, mystification, mythification,and reification to control the common man in his inherent ignorance-- and contrasts them with historical figures of liberation, who combated ignorance with knowledge and enlightenment. The title, and the story, begs the question, never answered...since it purports to reveal the Penultimate Truth, what is the revelation of the Ultimate Truth? - http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OO3545GAHJ7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572476&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Dr Tathata]

*****
The novel depicts colonists on the planet Mars (a thinly disguised analogue for life in 1960s suburbia) who are so bored they have to take a hallucinogenic drug called Can-D to stay sane. Can-D causes a group hallucination in which several persons can participate. However, the titular Mr Eldritch, a drug pusher from outer space, comes to Mars and offers a new and more powerful hallucinogen, Chew-Z.

Palmer Eldritch, a character based on an hallucination that Dick himself once experienced, is a wealthy industrialist with metal eyes, a metal hand and a metal jaw. In character and action he seems to this writer to resemble the "crippled man" of German expressionist movies and literature; who is himself physically crippled, but has almost a supernatural control over others. Examples of such characters in movies include the Professor in "Metropolis", the title character in "Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari", and the title character in Fritz Lang's "Dr Mabuse" films. More recent examples may include the title character in Kubrick's "Dr Strangelove", and the stammering, limping Dr Schreber in Alex Proyas' "Dark City".

The character of Eldritch is the unforgettable centre of the novel, and is truly a terrifying presence.

The effect of Eldritch's drug Chew-Z is to cause the user to enter a hallucinatory reality, apparantly of his or her own choice. However, in these realities the user is alone - no one else can enter their hallucinations except, apparantly, Palmer Eldritch. The contrast between the two drugs may be seen as an analogy of the difference between the "soft drug" marijuana and the hard drug heroin. While marijuana may be taken in company, heroin is taken alone, and the user becomes withdrawn. (Incidentally, Life Savers recently put out a type of sweet called "CHEWZ").

The main character, Barney Mayerson, is obsessed with going back to his estranged wife. When he takes Chew-Z, and hallucinates that he goes back to his wife but is rejected, Eldritch reappears and goads him into taking more of the drug to try again, and again, and again. Every time Barney goes back, the universe of the hallucination degrades slightly. Palmer Eldritch begins manifesting himself in the universe. As per the title, the "stigmata" of Palmer Eldritch - his mechanical parts - begin to appear on other people - even when Barney is supposedly in the 'real" world again. This can be seen as an analogy of neurotic or compulsive behaviour, wherein the neurotic, of any kind, is caught in a loop of doing the same unfulfillable action over and over. The neurotic can even be caught in a thought loop, repeating the same fruitless thoughts again and again.

The degrading of Barney's universe is a little like the effects of schizophrenia. At an advanced stage the schizophrenic may be totally locked off from the world. Rather than experience new things in the external world, the schizophrenic may become highly introverted, feeding off his or her own internal "world" forever. Eventually the internal "world" becomes more and more degraded, until nothing is left but "white noise". This conception was explored much more fully in another Dick masterpiece, "Martian Timeslip".

Meanwhile, a second theme involves the religious analogies of Chew-Z. Dick seems obsessed with the theme of the taking of Chew-Z as being analogous to the partaking of Eucharist by the Catholic. Whereas the flesh of Christ causes the devotee to enter the fellowship of the church and other people, Eldritch's evil Eucharist causes the devotee to become more and more withdrawn from the "light" of other people.

Added to this is the theme of stigmata. While th development of stigmata among Christians is supposed to reflect the absolute reality of the Christian God, the taker of chew-Z sees the manifestations of Eldritch all over the place - of one man, clearly not God, whose limited and apparently psychotic world view insidiously engulfs the entire universe of the user.

Finally, "The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch" can be seen as an analogy of modern life. In the novel's future, while infinite technology has given mankind incredible achievements, its chief net effect has been to make life very dull. Most of the touted "high technology" created today is literally created to entertain us. How are we much different from a drug user - languishing in dull lives where we work day after day to make enough money to lounge in front of an expensive television on weekends, surrounded by consumer goods? One is perhaps reminded of Sergio Leone's movie, "Once Upon a Time in America", where the denizens of New York City are depicted spending their hard-earned money in lying about in an opium den watching a shadow play and taking drugs.

Clearly even very rich people are there. Why develop so much technology if it is chiefly used to make us feel pleasure, in a world incresingly sterile and eventless?

"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch" can undoubtedly be seen as one of Philip K Dick's masterpieces. Indeed, this writer believes it to be his greatest achievement of all. Though it could be said to be poorly written from a technical standpoint, the sheer power of his images and themes is almost overwhelming. It also tends to stay in the mind for a long time.

Philip K Dick is best known for the number of recent movies made from his stories. However, no film has ever been made of this book, even though it seems ideally suited to such a medium. An expressionist style retelling of this tale, even on a low budget, could be very effective.

The book itself is currently very widely available, thanks to an apparant boom in interest in the author. The current printings I am aware of are American paperbacks put out by Vintage and Milennium.

Similar books to "Three Stigmata" by the same author include "Martian Timeslip", created the previous year, which explores very similar themes. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDZ92BW9W0XM/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572557&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*The Crack in Space* (1966)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Crack-Space-Philip-Dick/dp/0547572999/[Amazon]

*****
Although he displayed remarkable prescience in many of his books, cult author Philip K. Dick was a good 72 years off the mark in his 18th sci-fi novel, "The Crack in Space." Originally released as a 40-cent Ace paperback in 1966 (F-377, for all you collectors out there), the novel takes place against the backdrop of the 2080 U.S. presidential election, in which a black man, Jim Briskin, of the Republican-Liberal party, is poised to become the country's first black president. (Dick must have liked the name "Jim Briskin"; in his then-unpublished, non-sci-fi, mainstream novel from the mid-'50s, "The Broken Bubble," Jim Briskin is the name of a DJ in San Francisco!) Unlike Barack Obama, whose campaigning centered around the issues of war, economic crisis and health care, Briskin's talking points are a staggering overpopulation problem, the issue of what to do with the "bibs" (100 million frozen citizens awaiting their thaw in a better day), and the shutting down of the Golden Door Moments of Bliss satellite, an orbiting brothel housing no less than 5,000 women. When a door to a parallel Earth is discovered in the wall of a defective Jiffi-scuttler (a tubular device for instantaneous transportation from place to place), Briskin feels confident that he finally has a solution as to where to dump all those bibs. But problems loom, when an exploration team discovers that this parallel Earth is not vacant, but rather peopled by...well, perhaps I'd better not say.

Filled with a typically large Dickian cast of characters (38 named characters are featured...15 of them in just the first 10 pages!), "The Crack in Space" is a very swift-moving vision of the future. With the use of jetcabs, men and women in this book flit from city to city like you might commute to work; indeed, one potential assassin flies from Reno to Chicago while Briskin is delivering a speech! As in many other Dick novels, divorce is featured (Dick himself was married five times) and some truly outre characters are presented. Most memorable here is George Walt, the owner of the Golden Door satellite: a one-headed, two-bodied mutant who constantly bickers with himself. Dick presents a future here in which abortions are legal and paid for by the government (and this was written a good seven years before Roe v. Wade was settled); the only coffee that is consumed (except by the lowest classes) is the "nontoxic," synthetic kind; and political parties, under the ruling of the Tompkins Act, are allowed to jam the transmissions of the opposing party. It is a typically nutty Dick world, for the most part, in which Briskin's campaign manager voices some very PC words on Dick's behalf. Thinking about the people found on the parallel Earth, Sal Heim ponders "the difference between say myself and the average Negro is so damn slight, by every truly meaningful criterion, that for all intents and purposes it doesn't exist." Again, a pretty right-on sentiment for 1966, and one which makes the book praiseworthy in its own right.

"The Crack in Space" is hardly a perfect work. Fast paced and entertaining as it is, and filled with colorful characters, bursts of humor and remarkable situations, there are some problems that crop up. Several main characters (such as Myra Sands, a renowned abortionist) just kinda disappear, and the exploration of the alternate Earth (for this reader, the most fascinating and exciting segment of the book) is a bit too brief. Still, these are mere quibbles. Though this book has been pooh-poohed by some (the British critic David Pringle, in his "Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction," inexplicably calls it "a clotted Dick narrative"), I really did enjoy it very much. Let's just hope that President Obama has an easier time with his wars, economic woes and health care reforms than Jim Briskin will have with his problem of the bibs! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJ9ZZRGIUFFE/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572999&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[s.ferber]

*****
Manfred Steiner can see the future and it horrifies him. Arnie Kott sees the future and knows that nothing but opportunity lies ahead, if you can just grease the right palms and have the right vision. Both of them want to change the future and only one of them can. Manfred is autustic and barely able to communicate, Arnie is perfectly normal, as far as people go, even if he's a bit ambitious. They live on Mars. This is their story. It's not going to end well for one of them.

One thing we've seen with the latter day Mars stories is that they tend to concentrate on the hard science aspects of going to Mars, with the human consequence of it, while important, taking a second place. Kim Stanley Robinson's famed Mars Trilogy managed to work on both aspects fairly well, even if it did veer more into science by the end of it, and there's a whole host of other stories that have tried to slip their way in a maze of technical descriptions about terraforming and actual human emotions. Bradbury's "Martian Chronicles" dispensed with that entirely and sort of just went with the feel of moving to an alien world and slowly replacing the people that used to live there.

Dick's novel sort of takes the middle ground, with the Martian colony already set up and running, giving him room to focus more on the people who live there and what they go through to live there. Most of it is dreary and depressing and grey, but it's life all the same, which seems to be a constant theme for Dick (it crops up again in "Man in the High Castle", which on some level is about Life As We Know It being radically different but focusing on the people who get by from day to day) . . . the novel is essentially an ensemble piece, with Arnie Kott being the focal point that most of the events seem to rotate around. He's the leader of the local union, and a bit of a hustler, making sure that he has the best in black market goods, women, and so on. But he'd like more and when he comes across Manfred, and a doctor's theories that autistic kids are just experiencing time at a different rate than we are, he decides this might come in handy.

We meet a cast of characters, all of which are connected to each other in ways that don't seem obvious, giving the events a sense of inevitability, as one character's suicide makes other events possible, as interrelations between the others send the story along to its conclusion. Dick plays with perception quite a bit, especially toward the middle and end parts, with the book feeling like it's going off the rails (there's at least one of those moments in any Dick novel, where you feel like he's lost you entirely by shifting into a different plane of thought) in one sequence where repair guy Jack Bohlen goes to a party with Arnie and his mistress. Meanwhile we're treated to views of everyone else from Manfred's point of view, which is just as warped as you might imagine.

People expecting action or anything like that are probably in the wrong spot and definitely with the wrong author. Dick's skill was questioning how we interpret reality and perhaps how he interpreted reality, in putting individuals over collective authorities and putting forward a fluid view of Time. The novel is spare, the characters are downtrodden, the view of the future bleak no matter who is looking at it, and Dick seems to be suggesting, like a song from "Avenue Q", that everyone is a little bit schizophrenic.

SF critic John Clute once compared this to the writing of William Faulkner and said it was bleak and depressing but also hideously and hilariously funny . . . I can't say there are many laugh out loud moments but there is a certain black humor in everyone just deciding that giving up seems like too much work so they might as well go on anyway. It doesn't pack the strongest punch of his novels but it excels in making Mars seem like the grimy modernity of our world, just one step removed to another landscape, and that sense of construction in its details that pushes it toward a conclusion that is completely impossible to avoid. You're going to get the future one way or another, it just may not be the one you want or expect. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M7W6MNJQZLDE/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572573[Michael Battaglia]

[[A_Scanner_Darkly]]
*A Scanner Darkly* (1977)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Scanner-Darkly-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0547572174/[Amazon]

*****
There is an old adage about writing: "Write what you know"--as quoted verbatim from Hemmingway, among many others, this proverb is a key to mastering the craft. One's best work originates from principle experience, core emotions; the rest is just window-dressings, technique for transition. Philip K. Dick, one of the most prolific authors of science fiction for the later half of the twentieth century, wrote about what he knew: paranoia, `big brother', psychological disruptions, drug abuse; and the sci-fi `trimmings' of aliens, techno-dystopias, etc. usually served as interesting backdrops. As a mad, bad, meth-snortin' horsemeat lovin' pulp master, the dominant themes Dick experienced during his relatively short(ened) life appear again and again in the bulk of his work, though rarely so coherently expressed as in his tragic masterpiece, _A Scanner Darkly_.

The `basics:' Bob Arctor is a drug dealer who is also Fred, a narc working undercover with the LAPD to bust a big time drug dealer named...Bob Arctor. Bob/Fred's drug of choice, Substance D(eath), gradually splits the user's brain into two separate halves, corroding the interaction between the hemispheres and rendering one a split-personality veering chaotically close to schizophrenia. Bob doesn't realize he's Fred, and vice-versa (except in moments of rare epiphany). As anyone who has read VALIS can attest, the real-life events from which this story is based occurred to Dick in the beginning of the `70's, and most of his fiction afterward were attempts for him to glean and get down the life-shattering experience. _A Scanner Darkly_ was debatably his most successful attempt, and certainly his most lucid.

For all the futuristic flourishes, the bulk of _A Scanner Darkly_ basically describes the everyday existence of Orange County drug users. The dissipation of the body and slow decay of the mind; the rupturing of the moral core for the immediate high; life on the downward spiral--it's all documented here, in harrowing fashion. Among the endless repetitive conversations and breakdown-ruminations, there are a few moments of outstanding imagery-the Connie/Donna face-melt and the flower-field being the most prominent in recollection--the first hideous, the second serene--both chilling to the bone given the circumstances.

Never a literary stylist, Dick's simple prose veered from elegant to downright amateurish, making some of his lesser/cryptic works a bit of a slog, yet in this particular volume, the author's heart can be found in the characters, environments, and overall pathos; the feel of catharsis is prevalent throughout and made abundantly clear in the coda:

"They wanted to have a good time, but they were like children playing in the street; they could see one after another of them being killed--run over, maimed, destroyed--but they continued to play anyhow."

A melancholic, mad masterpiece. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HOC8LOH03JD8/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547572174#R1HOC8LOH03JD8[Ian Vance]

Sir Kenelm was the son of one of the gunpowder plotters who tried and failed to blow up James I. Perhaps surprisingly, his execution proved no hindrance to a friendship between the sons. He was a Groom of the Bedchamber to Charles I and a great collector of recipes, particularly of "Meath". The Closet contains more than 100 recipes for fermented honey-based drinks along with recipes ranging from wild boar to boiled eggs. His recommendation that "collops of bacon with eggs" make a good breakfast is the first reference, I believe, to that staple of English cuisine, the fry-up. - http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/19/lawrence-norfolk-top-10-food-books[Lawrence Norfolk]

*****
Stone Junction reads like a literary Frankenstein construct - equal parts Tom Robbins' whimsy, Umberto Eco's esotericism, and Ken Kesey's individualism/anarchism, yet it is all Jim Dodge's brilliance. If this witches brew makes you blanche in horror then avoid this book. If, however, like me, it whets your imagination and sets your mind to salivating, then by all means crack the covers and come dance at the monster's ball!

Stone Junction will introduce you to the AMO - The Alliance of Magicians and Outlaws, or some say Alchemist Magicians and Outlaws, or perhaps Artists, Mythsingers, and Outriders. Whatever the acronym's meaning, it is made up of the most amazing collection of gentle grafters, charming grifters, clever forgers, high stakes gamblers, Zen safe crackers, mountain men drug dealers, forgers, alchemist, and magicians; anarchists all. Some reviewers have called these characters impossible. Improbable yes, but only impossible for those who lack experience and imagination. It is as fine a collection of heroes as one could wish for in this increasingly authoritarian age.

The tale itself is a quest, coming of age story, and parable. Its comedy will make you cry; its tragedy will crack you up with laughter. It is an excellent mirror of life.

Jim Dodge has reached the pinnacle of his writing powers in this his third novel. Fup, his first effort, is a charming but limited short parable. Not Fade Away, his second effort, presented an amazing journey without much of a destination. In Stone Junction, the journey Dodge imagines is incredible with an ending worthy of the story he creates.

If you find this review excessive, I will wager diamonds to toilet paper that you will not enjoy the novel. If it intrigues you, assume that you are the intended audience, and acquire this book ASAP. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ZYNV7PK4CZG/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802135854[Theo Logos]

"This remarkably influential volume is the second edition, a more filled-out argument about what makes planets livable. No professional astronomers had paid much attention to this, so it fell to Dole, an engineer at Hughes Labs in Santa Monica, to work through the myriad parameters that must be just so to make a world as fine as ours.

The book's climactic chapter is "An Appreciation of the Earth," and indeed, that is the book's effect. The first edition provoked a popularization by Isaac Asimov, but the second made speculative planetology respectable. Soon enough, the battle over whether we and Earth are very special and rare, or so-what common, raged in The Astrophysical Journal but not in the pages of Analog.

Dole had unified many threads that ran through science fiction, dressing them up for polite scientific company. His fate was to be largely forgotten. I had him down to my campus to give a colloquium in 1973 and he was grateful; he had never been asked to speak at a university. He died in 2000 a few miles from U. C. Irvine, proud to have authored a book that sold a few thousand copies in a decade. That same year, the latest entry in the debate, Rare Earth, sold more than 50,000 copies in six months. Dole's slim, lonely volume is still more fun to read, and more precise." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2002/cur0203.htm[Gregory Benford]

Donne wrote The Courtier’s Library when he was a young, bitter man working as a lawyer to make ends meet and support a growing family. He’d recently lost his title as the secretary to Sir Thomas Egerton, England's Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, after he’d secretly marrying Egerton's niece, Anne More. More’s father, a courtier and parliament member, disapproved of the relationship, and when he learned of his daughter's union, Sir George More briefly imprisoned Donne and stripped him of his post.

Donne circulated The Courtier’s Library among his friends and patrons, but didn’t dare to print it during the reign of King James I, when anti-Catholicism was on the rise. (Donne was raised Catholic but eventually converted to Anglicanism.) In addition to poking fun at religion, it made fun of real public officials. One of the scandalous catalog’s imaginary books features "the many confessions of poisoners given to Justice Manwood, and used by him afterwards in wiping his buttocks, and in examining his evacuations.” The manuscript also contains sections called “Ars Spiritualis Inescandi Mulieres" ("The Spiritual Art of Enticing Women"), “On the Nothingness of a Fart,” and “Concerning the method of emptying the dung from Noah’s Ark.” - http://mentalfloss.com/article/514168/found-long-lost-copy-john-donnes-fart-filled-satire[Kirsten Fawcett]

The epic is conceivably the endpoint of the modernist implosion into premodern aesthetics and anti-formal/anti-perspectival tribal art. Whether that makes GUNSLINGER modern, postmodern, or premodern is anyone's guess, 5 of 8 dentists prefer "postmodern." The book smears semantics and Heidegger and cocaine into a psychedelic, post-industrial dreamscape. Ed Dorn studied an americanized version of "psychogeography" at the Black Mountain College with Charles Olson and Robert Creely which contributed to the development of his slow-acid-laced-western-sound poetry aesthetic: "I have no wish to continue my debate with men, my mare lathers with tedium, her hooves are dry. Look, they are covered with the alkali of the enormous space between here and formerly."(Gunglinger, Book 1). This should be read with some cigars and cactus and MM's cover of Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show's "Get My Rocks Off" and Beck's parenthetical "Lazy Flies" ("The skin of a robot vibrates with pleasure, Matrons and gigolos Carouse in the parlor"). - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GBGACR9KGH76/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822309327[Wesley Moore]

*****
Charles Duff wrote a charming book on executions and in particular English hangman. This book is a feigned tribute on executioners and in particular English executioners. Mr. Duff is arguing against capital punishment, but he does so without the cant of political correctness. Anyone who enjoys good humor will appreciate this book.

Mr. Duff presents vivid details of the English hangmen's "art" and uses hunmorous anecdotes of their fine craft in dispatching malafactors. There are humorous examples of how the English hangmen used mathematics and careful study of the intended victims so that executions can be as painless and as quick as possible. Mr. Duff traces the improvements in public executions since Anglo-Saxon England and after the Conquest (1066). He comments on "Merrie Ole England" when the Tudors used hanging along with drawing-and-quartering which some of the English refer to as "The good old days."

Mr. Duff cites examples of State sponsored executions whereby the condemned was actually innocent, but the State or Crown had to have their "pound of flesh" regardless of errors in justice. Mr. Duff cites examples where "court experts" were either wrong or perjured themselves so that an execution could take place, the hangmen could maintain gainful employment.

Readers should note that at the turn of the 19th century (the 1800s), there were 210 offenses for which hanging was the punishment for the crime. These crimes included poaching on royal land, theft of five shillings (less than the value of a dollar), etc. Mr. Duff cites associating with gypsies as a capital offense, but he could not understand why associating with politicians was not included.

For sheer humor, Mr. Duff uses a hypothetical case of the owner of butcher shop who caught his wife having an affair with an employee. Mr. Duff's description of the blow-by-blow brawl is amusing to say the least. This amusing anecdote starts on page 92.

Mr. Duff also feigns and enterprising spirit when he suggested that film directors, television executives, media sponsors use their talents to publicly present executions to the fun and amusement of a population with morbid interests in such events.

Mr. Duff pretends to show the shock of unemployed executioners just because of botched executions which resulted in decapitation, prolonged suffering, etc. However, Mr. Duff uses the judges' instructions that the condemned be hanged until dead regardless of the time or suffering.

The one reviewer who wrote that he or she were appalled by this book either did not read it, or they have no sense of humor whatsoever. The idiotic comment the reviewer made that men like Mr. Cooper are disappearing is in incredible bad taste. The fact that such men have used humor to deal with tragedy is a sign that civilization is not dead.

Again, this book was written as feigned praise for executioners. Mr. Duff was opposed to capitial punishment which is often debated. This reviewer favors capital punishment in extreme cases, but Mr. Duff's book gives readers who can think and apprecaite humor something to ponder. While the book did not change this reviewer's mind, it sure made him think. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8RZFSP2DNKW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322676&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[James E.

[[Vellum]]
*Vellum: The Book of All Hours* (2006)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Vellum-Book-Hours-Hal-Duncan/dp/0345487311/[Amazon]

*****
Vellum is a non-linear re-imagining of the world's myths and religions through an end-of-the-world scenario, intertwining many thematic elements of horror, science fiction and fantasy. I loved reading it, it was challenging, grand, audacious, and engaging. If you enjoy reading challenging fantasy/sci-fi/horror and can tolerate non-linear narrative than you will love reading this novel. Though as a reader that enjoys non-linear narrative it is not without its literary criticisms. Warning there is a lot of homo-erotic imagery (which doesn't quite cross the line of gratuitous).if you have problems with that, best to avoid this work.

Overall Vellum follows the story of six or seven characters through different incarnations and histories which are intertwined through myth and history and legend through to the end of this world and the next. The overriding thread that ties these characters through all of their different incarnations is the Vellum, the Book of Names, the Book of all hours, in which all that exists or will exist in this existence, or the next (or the existence next-door) is written. The characters are members of the Unkin whom have the word of god, or their mystical names placed on their very being. These characters are the incarnations, re-incarnations, and re-iterations of the various gods, spirits, angels and demon archetypes. They play and re-play their parts throughout histories both real and imagined from the beginning of the world to the end, through this world and the next and are inferred in an infinity of other worlds throughout the book. Hal Duncan has drawn parallels of the different spiritual archetypes and strung them together into a narrative that encompasses the genres of classic and contemporary horror, post-modernism, cyber-punk and pulp sci-fi-fantasy. The cast is a who's who of "Finches Mythology" from ancient Sumer to Contemporary Gothic Horror archetypes with a heavy reliance on your catholic Angels, Fallen Angels and Demons. The main theme of the novel is the duality of good and evil, the connectedness of all the world's faiths, and the place of man in the scope of reality between faith and science. The main characters defy fate and religion and pay their prices as they are fated as they experience Armageddon, Ragnarok, or whatever end of the world scenario you subscribe to. Other than that, explanations are either too short to give justice to the depth of the narrative, or so long that the map becomes the territory (pun just realized, but apt). The novel begins, has a middle and a satisfying ending (which is better than many novels) though not necessarily all in that order.

The bad:The DNA of this book is all over it. Styles are largely cribbed from other authors, the influence of William Burroughs, HP Lovecraft, and Kurt Vonnegut are the most obvious (Joyce is also quoted by other reviewers and I will take them at their word, I haven't read Joyce so I wouldn't know), other influences read like the best of SF library of Phillip Dick, Phillip Farmer, William Gibson, Neal Stephanson, Anne Rice to those Myst novels (though Hal Duncan's imagining of the literary mechanism is so far superior to those disappointments it is not hardly worth mentioning). The transitions are often jarring, the parallels are sometimes tortured and not all of the ideas fit together in one neat package. Sometimes the novel seems to wander from the main story to be a love-letter tribute to a favorite author (Lovecraft dominates the whole middle of the story).

The good: The characters are engaging, likable, hatable or inscrutable as necessary through all their incarnations. The story and characters and the interplay between them defy labels without becoming convoluted (possibly confused). What is bad about this novel is also what is good, (there is a hypocritical element here) though the styles and themes have been explored before the author executed them deftly without ringing as just a derivative of other authors work. This is almost something new, the post-modern pure sci-fi/fantasy/horror novel (without all the heroin and navel-gazing) that still holds together as a complete story. The audacity and the scope of the novel is also encouraging. That it is written with great heart makes this a great read. Hal Duncan is a hell of a writer and I hope he is able to visit the same muse for his following works (Ink is out now, and I intend to read it). If you are a fan of Vonnegut, Pynchon, Burroughs, Lovecraft. you will probably really enjoy this novel.

Buy it; if you like being challenged by good literature. If you love scrutinizing Vonnegut and Pynchon, unraveling Burroughs or imagining the unspeakable horrors of Lovecraft, you will probably enjoy this.

Avoid it; if you are not a fan of non-linear narrative, or just want a distracting page-turner. If you have issues with the homo-erotic, you will want to steer clear. If you are intrigued pick up Pynchon's "Crying of Lot 49" or Vonnegut's "Breakfast of Champions" as a trainer. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DH1P0CQJO476/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345487311&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Shlepzig]

*Ink: The Book of All Hours* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
I remember when T.V. Guide used to rate televised movies that it gave a "two-star" rating to Charleton Heston's version of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" and a three-star rating to "Batman Returns." And I remember thinking that surely a second-rate "Caesar" deserved a better rating than a first-rate "Batman." I had similar thoughts about Duncan's "Ink." The book has considerable flaws -- for example, it is an incoherent mess. But its learning is so pervasive, its concept so grand, and its plotting so intricate that I hated to give it less than five stars when I have given five stars to, e.g., a Suzie Grafton mystery novel.

Perhaps the least bad way to read this book is to treat it as a series of loosely connected short stories involving the same (or similar) characters placed in different settings in different worlds. This book and its predecessor, "Vellum," is based upon the idea that the universe is a series of alternative worlds somehow connected to each other by "folds" in an overworld (or something like that -- as is often the case with this book, it is hard to tell whether Duncan's vision is inscrutably subtle or merely incomprehensible). Moreover, each of the different "worldlets" can be altered by the actions of the characters both in that world and in some other word (and apparently in the overworld as well). In turn, the worlds, the worldlets, and the overworld are somehow controlled by a book, called "The Book of All Hours" which exists, in various forms, in the various worldlets, and this book in some manner controls the fate of the world and worldlets themselves. How this plays out is a bit confusing. Finally, it appears that doing something -- it is not clear what -- with the Book of All Hours can cause the worldlets to coalesce (or collapse) into one (or perhaps more) universes.

Anyway, the characters are put through their paces in different stories in different settings in different worldlets. Whether these different stories are supposed to be simultaneous, serial, or whether the notions of time itself are irrelevant or plastic is not always clear. But it is fascinating to observe how what purports to be the same human material acts very differently in very different contexts -- a theme that has not received as much fictional treatment as one would think it deserves.

Duncan attempts to wrap all of this disparate material up in the last fifty-or-so pages. His long (too long?) denoument imagines his surviving characters in one world where they seem to enjoy one unified and rather peaceful existence. In my opinion, Duncan's mountainous plot has given birth to a mouse, but his alternative may have been to leave his magnum opus in shaggy-dog land.

Perhaps the most interest comment on Duncan's efforts was found in Fantasy and Science Fiction's review of "Vellum." The reviewer concluded that he really had to read to book over to be certain he got what it had to offer. I only wish I could be sure that Duncan has enough to offer to make the effort worth its while. Maybe T.V. Guide had it right, after all. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20IGC9595X4QX/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345487338[John E. Mack]

Some of the problems are so difficult, however, that not that much progress has been made in 20 plus years. What would be really nice would be to see this kind of book redone today.

*****
The 18th Lord Dunsany (d 1957) was an incredibly prolific writer who delved into poetry, plays, short stories, novels, essays, whatever. His prose work is characterized by two things: clever ideas and gorgeous English. He would get an idea--perhaps, while shooting snipe or fox-hunting, and then he'd dedicate himself (and the lives of family and servants) to its realization in whatever written medium seemed appropriate. One category of stories is probably best described as "lies." He felt a bit uncomfortable with the distance some of these tales achieved from plausibility, and so he put them into the mouth of a rather disreputable member of his club: Jorkens.

Judging from the collection of stories (the writing of which spanned his entire prose career), Jorkens traveled everywhere in the world and did everything. I especially like story of the man who flew a biplane to Mars (the planets were fortuitously aligned) and what he finds there.

Night Shade is publishing the entire collection of Jorkens stories, a great boon to those of us who either haven't been able to find copies of the originals or couldn't afford these now collector items. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGXVWY1TGL89/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=189238955X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Michael R.

*****
Our hero: a genius inventor living in Athens with a prostitute destined to murder her brother and become an international film star. His nemesis: Julian, suave & shadowy head of a huge multinational firm out for global domination ... and our hero's soul! His lover: Benedicta, Merlin Industries' fabulously wealthy heiress. Raised in a Turkish seraglio, she spends her days falconing in the hills above Istanbul ...

Improbable? You bet! Half the fun of this book is the B-movie TechniColor melodrama that Durrell lays on with trowel in hand and tongue almost certainly in cheek. What saves this from being a Grisham-style potboiler (fun in its own way) is the suspicion that Durrell doesn't believe in the plot any more than you do: the whole show's just a vehicle for his ideas. The shifting combination of doubles that each character pairs with in the story's weird geometry hints at the concept that everyone in the novel might just be an aspect of the same binary consciousness. The narrative style too--which loops and reloops languidly from past to present, then swoops in a flash to a climax, like one of Benedicta's falcons--tips you off that the workings of memory and the subjective sense of time it brings to our fragile notion of reality are as much a concern to Durrell as any of the events that unfold in his exotic & highly artificial world.

By today's standards, Durrell's prose is more than a little purple; that his women are basically walking dummies and his Orient the perverse, decadent hothouse of the British imperialist also marks "Tunc" as the relic of another era. But if you liked the "Alexandria Quartet" and want to recapture some of the magic, this book should fill a few pleasant afternoons.

P.S. "Tunc" forms a pair with "Nunquam"--both part of Durrell's "Revolt of Aphrodite" series--and each makes more sense if you read it in conjunction with the other. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RAG7HB2J9N2VF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085IMWZK&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text[Arch Llewellyn]

Durrell wrote a lot of fiction after The Alexandria Quartet. If you are a fan of Durrell, you should read all of it. The Tunc/Nunquam "double-decker novel" is a profound achievement also, truly prophetic about the effects of technology on the individual and society. His character is an inventor, and the science he is involved with in this novel has either come to pass or is entirely credible in the context of the story. Amazing that Durrell's mind encompassed the scientific realm so successfully. It makes these two books even more relevant today, after we've seen the technological progress in the almost 30 years since they were written. The science adds a new dimension to the creativity of Durrell. All the other elements of his writing that have entranced us through the years are here too. These books should be famous too! And after these he went on to write The Avignon Quintet. For all Durrell fans who stopped after the Quartet, I envy you. All these novels are new Durrell novels for you to discover for the first time!! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G192F1PPS2JW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085IMYNA&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Frederick K Schoff]

[[Lyric_of_the_Circle_Heart]]
*Lyric of the Circle Heart: The Bowman Family Trilogy* (1956-1963, 1995)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Lyric-Circle-Heart-American-Literature/dp/1564781364/[Amazon]

*****
A loose sequel to Go in Beauty, Eastlake's second novel has been the most successful and accessible of the Checkerboard trilogy. Tied to its predecessor only by Big Santi (George) Bowman, My Prayer and occasional character references, it can (and should for those uninterested in the prequel's artistic themes) be read on its own terms as a coming-of-age western epic, mixing the best of Kesey with Cormac McCarthy's rare comedy (i.e., Suttree) amongst a dusty, lonely landscape, seemingly without law or outside influence.

Across the Checkerboard, it always starts with a misunderstanding: The novel opens with a bloody shootout, neither participant, the Gran Negrito ('...an awfully odd color...for a white man') and Big Sant, sure of why they're defending themselves at the Circle Heart. Water? cattle? Idunfrigginkno. Watching from nearby, two curious Navajos curiously watch these two `white' outsiders act out their silly white ways, not really caring one way or the other. The Gran Negrito falls in a confused blaze to protect his son and protect his books. Big Sant rushes in to save the man despite the misunderstanding as a child rushes out the back. This is--right?--how the Circle Heart land comes to the Bowman line, and how Alastair Benjamin, the escaping child, joins the Bowmans.

The story itself is more in-focus this time around, and it follows the maturation of brothers Little Sant and Alastair Benjamin, their growings-up and growings-apart, each seeking to escape the Checkerboard region. Li'l' Sant dreams of nothing but being a bronc man, riding rodeos for the pleasure of anonymous crowds; Alastair nothing but an education, he reads and reads the burned out stories left behind by the Gran Negrito, wanting to get away from the Circle Heart's intellectual decrepitude, always quick to show off his advanced vocabulary (often ~incorrectly~).

Again, the plot serves a series of vignettes set over 8-ish years, the boys exploring the landscape, spending more and more time away from the Circle Heart, getting involved with Navajo tomfoolery or corporate-slash-government misadventures. A favorite moment, Eastlake takes a dip into Aldo Leopold territory, attacking in one instance the government's insistence on carnivore extirpation; their orders: 'Go out and kill all the coyotes because we have already killed almost all the big cats that prey on them and after you have killed all the coyotes then kill all the rabbits because when the coyotes are gone the rabbits will, of course, explode, and after the rabbits are gone whatever they feed on will be all over the place and then you exterminate that and then the next and the next until we are the only animal alive!' Eastlake. 1958. Way ahead of his time.

And again, the insistence of the Christian world to convert the native entire and take nothing in return. A manic-depressive missionary devotes his life to the conversion of the locals, with nothing to show for his lifelong attempt at expounding `progress' except for his garish European home and a single convert--whose death causes much confusion: Christian or Navajo? How the hell is this handled? and what does the missionary do now? kill himself? leave, hands empty? burn? or...('I must get downriver before they convert me.)?

Indian Fighter, Blue-Eyed Billy Peersall, 100-something years old, settled in the region long before, after the wars on the natives were halted, not liking the Indians but neither appreciating the whites' coping, he cares for nothing and tolerates everything, telling amnesiac stories of a fictionalized wild west or hushing for returned loneliness. The elder Navajo My Prayer shares his views during the climactic sweetie sweetie, reflecting in one of the most poignant commentaries on the white-red cultural divide:


"As soon as we spoke, the day we spoke, that was the beginning of the end. That was the day the white man began to love the Indian to death. A white man can never commit a crime and forget it. When we stole this land, when the Navajo stole this land from the Gallina people, the Navajo forgot it. Except for some rather pleasant memories of the war, the Navajo forgot it. When the white man stole this land from the Navajo Nation he has got to compound the crime in order to forget it. He's got to love us to death. Love is their way of not giving back something they have stolen....I wonder if the white man will ever learn that [to be tolerated]...is all any defeated people ever want....To be allowed to be different. Love is their way of intolerance. Love is their gentle way of grabbing you firmly by the ziz and twisting until an Indian hollers Uncle Sam. The whites never did anything wrong that wasn't made up for by this love. Their love is like a gentle ziz-twisting thing. Their love."


Don't let me forget Little Sant and Alastair Benjamin. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8HRA1WEADL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0962738751&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Todd Michael]

The other two reviews on this page are of different books, and the editorial excerpt isn't even in English! To clear things up: The Daedalus Press book is a collection of four stories, put into English by Margaret Jull Costa (not Cozta!), whose translations of Eca de Queiros are the best available. None of the four stories have the breadth or depth of "The Maias" but each of them is exceptional in its own way, and they're amazingly varied. The title story, something indeed of a novella, is a moral fable with satirical overtones that includes some brilliant sketches of the aimless world of late nineteenth-century diplomacy --something Eca knew very well, as he was a diplomat by profession. The other stories are shorter, one of them a sad comedy of manners and self-delusion, another a superb and deeply-felt essay in mediaevalism, as spooky as Hans Christian Andersen's "The Traveling Companion," and the last a study of idealism and romantic devotion narrated by a retired professor of German Idealist philosophy. The range of Eca's work is impressive, and the vividness of his writing and his economy of means are lessons for anyone who loves great writing. We English speakers are greatly in Ms. Costa's debt for making the work of such a great writer available. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5LTDQ51XA1M/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0946626987&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Michael Steinberg]

*****
This very short work give an account of three generations of Anglo-Irish landowners, each more short sighted and self destructive than the one that preceded him. The first two make efforts to preserve and increase the family fortune through such means as constantly dunning tenants for rents and feudal duties (hence the name of the estate, to “rack” or wring out the rent) or by constant litigation or the threat thereof. All this work goes to naught when the third heir, Sir Condy, completely wastes the estate through his own genial incompetence. While the most agreeable and pleasant of the three, Sir Condy is also the weakest and most dissipated. He comes to a horrible, drunken end, fully conscious of his ruin and the fact that he brought it about himself. All of this is narrated by his faithful retainer, Thady Quirk, who tearfully recounts the dismal downfall of his feudal lords in the most pathetic terms while all the while leaving you to wonder if he means devil a word of what he says and is really just about pulling your leg.

The tale seems to be composed of the essence of tragedy, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. This is because it possesses the essential Irish quality, a sprightliness and energy that carries both narratives along at a relentless pace along with a lively eye for the absurd in any situation. Edgeworth had a keen ear for Irish patterns of speech. Although an Englishwoman, Edgeworth was raised in Ireland and had a tremendous feel for the Irish viewpoint of her time. The humor of her tale is especially poignant in light of the fact that it was written soon after the terrible Rebellion of 1798, one of the most internecine of Irish conflicts. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Irish history, the early English novel, and anyone with a good sense of humor. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17BTQ0LS4ZN24/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl[Mark Mellon]

*****
This witty, labyrinthine postmodernist kaleidoscope is, among other things, a complex murder mystery, a feminist discourse and a metafictional riff on the possibilities of language and imagination. Elizabeth Harding, a strong-willed, divorced professor from upstate New York, buys a run-down historic house on Florida's Gulf Coast, planning to renovate it over the summer of 1977. On the day she takes possession, she stumbles on the corpse of the previous tenant. An old Creole woman rumored to practice voodoo is a suspect; her grandmother was the original owner of the house now believed to be haunted. The plot thickens when the body of a private eye dressed in a KKK robe is discovered--impaled on the fence surrounding Harding's property. Retired philosophy professor Elbrecht and Cornell English professor Fakundiny have created a fictive authorial persona, "Jael B. Juba," who interjects comments on the unfolding action. With referents ranging from Freud to Foucault to Greek myth and Hamlet , the text, a dazzling riot of exfoliating prose, deconstructs eros, selves and archetypes as it probes such themes as the trivialization of desire in a consumerist culture and the loss of individuality within a group. - http://www.amazon.com/Restorationist-Text-One-Collaborative-Literature/dp/0791415325/[Amazon boilerplate]

Ah, this book...a cherished one for me, pilfered from a friend who's father studied under Nabokov (but later given back). I read this under the serious spell of Knut Hamsun and this book is similiar to "Hunger" but perhaps more humorous. It's about an unemployed, alcholic cable fitter who is fired for charting diagrams of his comrades "idleness" correalated with the days they get drunk. Thrust into a serious drinking binge he is stuck on a train trying to reach Moscow and in between we have flashbacks of him trying to buy vodka before restaurants and stores have opened, giving us recipes of cocktails made out of aftershave ("Aunt Clara's Kiss) that brings on hallucinations and incredible verbal pyrotechnics full of literary ramblings and political rumblings. The whole time his hallucinations are marked by a pair of overcoated angels egging him on or chastising his behavior as he mixes up his route on the train forgetting to disembark and actually heading away from his destination. He finally does reach Moscow and the novel closes like a hand over a movie lens as abruptly as it started. It is a startling book, not only the best of the samizdat novels (works distributed like fanzines secretly during the communist regime) but by far the most dazzling comic novels ever written about desperation and alcholism. It is an incredible book and after reading it you will never have patience for another Bukowski book again. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWKMUSX6KVAB3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl[Mark R.

Evelyn is better known for his Diary and more respected for his wonderful treatise on trees, Sylva', but his Acetaria (or "Things fit to be spiced with vinegar") is packed with information on "sallets". These were vegetable dishes in general, not just salads. Evelyn lists more than 70 leaves as fit for consumption and one substance – sylphium – that had been extinct for several centuries (but that does not stop him supplying a scholarly history). Sylphium seems to have resembled asafoetida. - http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/19/lawrence-norfolk-top-10-food-books[Lawrence Norfolk]

The Diary of John Evelyn, a gentlemanly Royalist and virtuoso of the seventeenth century, was first published in 1818 under the title Memoirs Illustrative of the Life and Writings of John Evelyn, in an edition by William Bray. Bray was assisted by William Upcott, who had access to the Evelyn family archives. The diary of Evelyn's contemporary Samuel Pepys was first published in 1825, and became more celebrated; but the publication of Evelyn's work in part prompted the attention given to Pepys's.[1]

Evelyn's diary has entries running from 1640, when the author was a student at the Middle Temple, to 1706.[2] Its claim as a memoir to be a diary is not strict; up to around 1683 the entries were not daily additions, but were compiled much later from notes, and show in some cases the benefits of hindsight.[3] When his travels are described, buildings or pictures may be described anachronistically, revealing the later use of other sources. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Evelyn's_Diary[Wikipedia]

http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Country-Percival-Everett/dp/0807083631/[Amazon]

*****
It is this reviewer's opinion that Percival Everett's God's Country is nothing short of a mini-masterpiece. Set in 1871 and narrated by a very unlucky cowpoke, Curt Marder, the book shows the good, bad, and ugly aspects of life in God's Country (the proverbial Wild West).

The story opens with marauders burning Curt's ranch, kidnapping his wife, Sadie, and committing the ultimate indiscretion of shooting his beloved dog. Curt, a spineless coward and ardent racist, does nothing to stop them and watches from a distance as his home is destroyed. He hires Bubba, the best tracker in the area (who happens to be African American), to lead him to the culprits (and subsequently Sadie) in exchange for half the ranch. It is in the journey to save Sadie that Curt constantly witnesses and benefits from Bubba's selfless acts of benevolence and humanity, but is blinded by racism, stupidity, and ignorance to realize the errors of his ways. Instead, he consistently lies, steals, and cheats, largely driven by greed and his own self-interests.

Mr. Everett is an excellent writer having pulled off such a spoofy odyssey. Through his words, the reader experiences the sights, sounds, and smells of hard living in hard times. It is a relatively short novel that is richly saturated with dark humor and unforgettable, wonderfully imagined characters with names like Wide Clyde McBride, Pickle Cheeseboro, and Taharry whose speech impediment causes him to preface every word with "ta," thus earning him his unusual name. The book even includes a "cameo" appearance of "Injun killin'" George Cluster and bank robbers reminiscent of the James/Younger Gang.

This book touched on so many issues (the "isms") on a number of levels. Through the misadventures of Curt and Bubba, the author covers the institutionalized racism and social injustices that Native, Asian, and African Americans endured. There are painful scenes of an Indian tribe massacre and a lynching of an innocent black boy. The sexism exhibited against women in the West was evidenced in the Jake and Loretta storylines, and the emerging socio-economic strata (classism) between western landowners was touched upon as well. However, for me, the most powerful messages were saved in the last few pages of the novel's surprise ending. Without revealing too much, I thought it was clever in the way that the author paralleled Bubba's "dream" to live freely without fear or judgment to MLK's desire to be judged by the content of one's character and not by skin color. Curt comments that Bubba's dream did not sound like much of a dream summed up the underlying arrogance and indifference toward his fellow man that resonated throughout the story. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RBK0ZHLSIZFC7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807083631&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Pretty Brown Girl]

*****
Written primarily as a satire, "Erasure" works on so many levels that to pigeonhole it as a novel about race is inadequate. The book also succeeds as an oddly affecting family drama, as a spoof on the "ghetto novel," as a parody of academic pretension, and as a commentary on the publishing industry's infatuation with fleeting trends.

Nevertheless, "Erasure" has received prominence largely because of its discussion of what it means to be "black." The protagonist, Theolonius "Monk" Ellison, is a professor at a major California university who writes postmodern, academic fiction but finds himself unread and ignored largely because he refuses to publish the type of work "expected" of African Americans. To an obviously significant extent, this portrayal is autobiographical: in an interview published in The Guardian (a British newspaper), Everett commented, "When I see my books in the Black Fiction or Black Studies section, I feel baffled. I really don't know what those terms mean." Similarly, in the novel, Monk has a fit when he finds his own novels shelved in the African American studies section at a major bookstore chain. After reading this book, I went to a local branch of that same chain to look for Everett's other novels and found them all, ironically, in the last place I thought to look: under African American literature.

But back to "Erasure": When another writer, after spending a few days in Harlem, writes a "ghetto novel" that becomes a national best-seller, Monk, in anger, writes a dead-on satire that is published and, to the author's surprise, taken seriously as "the best novel by an African American in years . . . a true, raw, gritty work." The novel-within-the-novel, "My Pafology" (which is "reprinted" here in its entirety) is so over the top that it's impossible to believe that reviewers wouldn't recognize it as a farce. (An example of its humor: the main character, Van Go Jenkins, has fathered, by four different mothers, "fo' babies": Aspireene, Tylenola, Dexatrina, and Rexall.) But realism is not the point: Everett intends to reduce to absurdity the idea of the "ghetto novel" and its widespread acceptance as the embodiment of black experience.

In the previously mentioned interview, Everett carefully qualified this view of literature, saying, "I have nothing against ghetto novels or rural Southern novels, except that they are the only representations out there." This partly explains why, in spite of himself, Everett can't write a truly horrible "bad novel"; "My Pafology" is bracing even when it is ridiculous; it is undeniably authentic in its very inauthenticity. Everett acknowledged, "I can't even bear to read from that section because, despite all my efforts to the contrary, it works in some weird way." It's clear from the many ambiguities throughout "Erasure" that Everett does not mean to denounce such works as much as he means to condemn their pervasiveness. After all, Everett himself makes quite clear his own admiration for Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God"--the archetype of "rural Southern novels."

The aspect of "Erasure" that charmed me the most, however, was the interaction between Monk and members of his family: his aging mother, whose mental acuity is rapidly deteriorating; his sister Lisa, who works in a women's health clinic and is threatened by anti-abortion activists; and his brother Bill, who undergoes a hostile divorce when he reveals to his wife and children that he is gay. After you're done chuckling at Theolonius Ellison's antics as an author, you'll find yourself tearfully reflecting on the heartaches of his experiences as a son and brother. This storyline may seem detached from the major theme of the book--and that is, no doubt, exactly Everett's point: we all have families and experiences and backgrounds that transcend any notion of what it means to be "black"--or a member of any other blurrily defined group. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OG3HLVUFQFX5/[D.

Ted Street's head has been severed from his body in a car accident. The morticians have sewn it roughly back on before the funeral; but in the church he gets up out of his coffin and resumes his existence. He has no heart-beat or pulse, can feel no physical pain or discomfort, though his senses are super-receptive, and he can read past events in other people's lives. Of course he is a sensation. He himself is puzzled and worried, but he is calmer and more laid back than he was in his previous somewhat inadequate self as an academic and a husband.

The media are their usual vile intrusive self, and I whooped with joy when Theodore, on air, reveals the intimate private past of the interviewer (something I wish could be dished out to some media folk in real life!)

But the outside world will not leave him alone. A religious cult, led by a maniac, is sure that he is the Devil and that they have to destroy him. Another, equally crazy, religious group thinks he is the Messiah in his second coming. (A nice touch: the two groups sing the same hymn). The military are interested in him because it would be wonderful if through him they could discover what would make a soldier indestructible.

Ted may have no heart beat, but he has a caring heart, and in the end he does turn out to be a kind of Saviour, recalling Luke 18:16. And the final paragraph is, I suppose, the only possible ending, unexpected as it is.

The novel moves rapidly back and forth from one scene to another, from present to past, from waking to several dreams, from one character to another. There is a kind of subplot about what happens to Ted's wife and two children, which strikes me as a slight padding out. Prose and dialogue are terse, simple, clean and effective. Suspend your disbelief, and you have a fine piece of imaginative story telling, and, in the process, targeting seedy media, crazy religion, no-holds-barred military scientific research. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GRPJ7E4QZ12X/[Ralph Blumenau]

*****
I bought the book because I'd heard it was funny and figured it would be nice for a light read.

The writing team is made up of James Kincaid, who I've never heard of, and Percival Everett, well-known as the guy who refused to speak in the South Carolina State Legislature because of the presence of the Confederate flag. This sparked off a long controversy that eventually ended in its removal.

The book is indeed quite funny. It's also a relatively light read (though not quite as light as I'd intended - the language can be a bit dense, but always amusingly so).

The writing style often bears a striking resemblence to another Southern novel, Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, and the character Barton Wilkes of Toole's Ignatius J. Reilly.

"My dating life is, I am happy to say, creative and unboundeed by rules of public declarations. I am not one to say, "I will only date people who do A, or people who eat B, or people who are proficient at backyard C, or people who---," You see. Your comments on my complexion (poor), slouch, and bad hair are fine jokes. Very manly. That's just one thing I like about you. I think we are the sort who could, if we liked, have some beers, eat peanuts, watch football, insult one another, and pee on the floor. That is if we wanted to, if you wanted to. I mean we could do that, not necessarilly that we would or anything like that. It'd be up to you."

The book, of course, needs to take on the Strom issue, and does so, albeit reluctantly and seldomly. In doing so it makes a cogent (And sincerely held? Hard to tell.) point about the rift between the Southern and Northern states, and the subtle politics of self-righteousness that led the Northerners to condemntation of the South in spite of their own grave defficiencies in regard to civil rights.

As James says in a letter to Percival after their first meeting with Strom:

"I sort of like him, and I don't think that's a racist thing to say. You admitted you sorta liked him too. There was the quasi-headstand [he did], of course, but think of it as pathos. He's just trying to find his way back to the light as all the windows are closing on him. That's a good line we can use in the history." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DQ11YARH3D9Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl[Jeffrey Gordon]

*****
In this dizzy, profound merry-go-round of a read, the author initially seduces readers with outrageous humor. Three Stooges “Who’s on First” variety puns spin off “Not Sidney Poitier.”  Given this odd name by his unusual mother and fated to bear an uncanny resemblance to his “not” namesake, Not Sidney remains straightforward and perplexing:  “Really you’re not Sidney Poitier are you?” “Yes, I am.” 

This wordplay runs throughout as Sidney’s life unfolds, managing to remain an entertaining personal saga as well as a multilevel irreverent exploration of the black experience, the American experience, and the elusiveness of identity in the face of stereotypes and media images. Not Sidney enacts the “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?” scenario with his girlfriend’s color conscious black family who distinguish to a nicety the various shades of skin and their meanings. They expect a darker black man to be poorer and less successful than themselves. Wealthy Not Sidney confounds them and ultimately rejects the movie paradigm of begging for their acceptance. The parallels to Poitier movies continue. Not Sidney is bound “Defiant Ones” style to a redneck as they escape from a prison. Later, he uses a hilarious technique called Fesmerism to compel a bigoted sheriff to become his only trustworthy protector (shades of actor Poitier’s “In the Heat of the Night.”)

In the end “Not Sidney” seems to become his almost namesake for the space of an evening.

I adored this book’s clever, entertaining, existential profundity. The author even “Mary Sues” himself, becoming Not Sidney’s college professor and mentor under his own name and profession. Everyone assumes the professor is being brilliant when they can’t follow his mental leaps—everyone except Not Sidney who calls nonsense, admits he doesn’t understand and shows that the emperor wears no clothes—or does he?

The title suggests this book will repudiate the saintly black characters portrayed by actor Sidney Poitier.  My expectations were met, confounded and exceeded all at the same time, perhaps in the same way that Not Sidney Poitier meets and confounds questions about his name and identity throughout the novel. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VQ7KTQWV2K2P/[Sherry King]

*****
There is nothing better than great satire, especially a great satire of the literary criticism of the 1960s and 1970s - the kind of satire that has you laughing out loud at conversations between Bruneau and Thales (Bruneau: Would you like some water? Thales: Very funny.), God and Barthes, Wittgenstein and Russell, and many others.

Glyph, according to its cover, is a novel, but the book is much more than that. There are tidbits of anatomically themed poetry, literary theory, and seemingly random dialogues wrapped around the central text, which are the memoirs of Ralph, age four, reminiscing about his infancy. Ralph is no ordinary child; he is gifted, although no one realizes it, since he will not talk. Then Ralph one day writes a note to his mother. He has a gift for language, which he displays through reading and writing, not speaking. Incidentally, the first book he read was not written by A. A. Milne - it was by Wittgenstein.

Ralph has an interesting childhood - his father is a "postructuralist pretender" and his mother is an artist. With the best intentions, they take Ralph to see a psychologist, the evil Dr. Steimmel, and there his adventures begin. He is kidnapped, then kidnapped from the kidnappers. Along the way, Ralph tells the reader what he really thinks of "that Derrida guy" and a whole slew of other has-beens in academic circles, always with Barthes appearing in snippets of conversation, to say, among other things, "I am French, you know."

One might assume that the plot plays second fiddle to Ralph's commentaries. On the contrary, the plot is engrossing. I laughed at the satire and cried for Ralph. It was quite an emotional roller coaster, and I reveled in every minute of it. Glyph takes literature to new horizons. I highly recommend it, even if the reader has no experience with literary criticism. Sifting through the jargon for the plot is worth the trouble. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJHDK95OTHNUX/[Reader]

This is a very funny book, in which the more amusing turns of phrase used in F. N. Fanthorpe's science fiction and supernatural novels are collected.

A word of warning, however. It may give a false impression of his works. Fanthorpe was a very clever writer who turned out some quite presentable novels, considering that he had to churn them out at the rate of one every two days, without any chance of proof-reading them before they were published. This book should be read for laughs, but the examples represent more the exception rather than the rule. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGAI0W1BR1IS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GDDKQM&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Malcolm Smith]

*****
Far too long out of print, TARZAN ALIVE: THE DEFINITIVE BIOGRAPHY OF LORD GREYSTOKE is a postmodern classic that will appeal to readers of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Philip José Farmer, as well as those interested in parascholarship, fictional biographies, and literature in general. This is the book that launched the concept of the Wold Newton family, the genetic lineage exposed to a radioactive meteorite in 1795, thus spawning a number of great detectives, scientists, explorers, and adventurers, some of whom border on the superhuman. Farmer's addenda, expanding this concept to include a multitude of literary characters (such as those from Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and Jack London's THE SEA WOLF, to name only a couple), alone make the cost of this book worth it.

This is truly the definitive edition of TARZAN ALIVE, and Bison Books has wisely added a number of extras that will make this edition worth owning even if one already has a Doubleday, Popular Library, or Playboy Paperbacks copy of the book. Collected here, but missing from the older versions of the book, are two gems: 1) "Extracts from the Memoirs of 'Lord Greystoke' (previously only available in the hard-to-find anthology MOTHER WAS A LOVELY BEAST); and 2) "Tarzan Lives: An Exclusive Interview with the Eighth Duke of Greystoke" (in which Farmer himself interviews the Jungle Lord). Further, the Bison Books edition includes an insightful new foreword by Win Scott Eckert (editor of MYTHS FOR THE MODERN AGE: PHILIP JOSÉ FARMER'S WOLD NEWTON UNIVERSE), which places TARZAN ALIVE in the context of "Sherlockian biographical scholarship," showing how Farmer's book is truly exemplary (and also transcendent) in the field of fictional biography. This is followed by a new introduction by science fiction author Mike Resnick discussing Farmer's other Tarzan pastiches.

The book itself is a compelling read. Farmer treats the subject of his "biography" as a living person about whom Edgar Rice Burroughs chronicled in fictionalized form. This livens up what otherwise would be a dry summary of ERB's Tarzan series, as Farmer often interjects with persuasive comments, conjectures, and elaborations in the brilliant style that is unique to him. In TARZAN ALIVE, Farmer breathes new life into the legend of Tarzan, all out of a respectful love for the character which pours from every word on every page of this delightfully wonderful work. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F22UWZRM0TYN/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803269218&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Christopher Paul Carey]

*****
Doc Savage is one of those enduring pulp icons who will always have a cult following no matter how many years pass since his heyday. The creation of writer Lester Dent, Doc Savage was a combination private eye/crusading scientist/super hero who, with the help of his loyal assistant, managed to defeat some of the most evil threats that mankind has ever had to face. Certainly a bit corny but always a great deal of fun, the Doc Savage tales were always amongst the best of their type and, as the world continues to get more and more complicated, there's something wonderfully reassuring about entering into Doc Savage's world and discovering that evil can always be defeated by one bronze skinned genius. For this reason, Doc Savage continues to maintain a loyal fan base into the present day. One of these fans was the late science fiction writer Phillip Jose Farmer (creator of the Riverworld series and several other underground classics). Farmer wrote Doc Savage, His Apocalyptic Life as an obvious labor of love. While he goes out of his way to try to accurately document the mythos of Doc Savage (though some critics are correct when they point out that he sometimes draws conclusions that are far more Farmer than Dent), Farmer does so with a welcomed tone of uptmost (if still bemused) seriousness. Treating this book as not just a long fan letter but instead as an actual biography of an actual man, Farmer affords Doc Savage fans a dignity that others who have attempted to write about classic pulp icons haven't.

The book to a certain extent acts as a sequel to Farmer's better known (but, to me, of lesser quality) Tarzan Alive. As in the Tarzan book, Farmer concludes with lengthy and imaginative geneaology in which he manages (with not too many excessive liberties taken with their established canons) to show that every pulp hero was in some way related. Along with Tarzan, Doc Savage is soon to be related to Bulldog Drummond, James Bond, Nero Wolfe, The Scarlet Pimpernil, Prof. Challenger, the Shadow, and just about anyone else you could think of. No, its not meant to be taken seriously but, like the original Doc Savage stories themselves, its still a lot of fun. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TPIOL29AMYEV/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553088343[Jeffrey Ellis]

*****
The Fangs of Suet Pudding may be the most unusual book you read this year. It was written during WWII by "Adams Farr" who may or may not be the narrator of the tale, a teenage girl. Through her eyes we see what it was like to live in France when the Germans were marching through at the beginning of the war. But Loreley is no ordinary girl and the adventures she encounters when she allows a thief in the night to share her bedroom are not like any other war story you've ever heard. Although she has nothing in common with Lisbeth Salander, the super-girl from Stieg Larsson's popular thrillers of 2011, she has as much gumption and charming wiles as Lisbeth. And she can tell a story better than almost anyone writing today. Your library of oddities will not be complete until you have a brand-new edition of this very obscure and hard-to-find book in it. Chris Mikul introduces it and Gavin L. O'Keefe provides the cover art. It's a book you won't forget for a long time. - http://www.amazon.com/Fangs-Suet-Pudding-Adams-Farr/dp/1605435597/[Amazon]

*****
I do not fully concur with the other reviewer's claim of parallel to Joyce, but the daunting mass and prose of the text is indeed worthy of mention in the age of slim, polite volumes. The prose itself is rough in parts, and does occasionally lend itself to other pedantic or sophomoric assessments of theoretical concerns, but this is adequately contextualized by a rather disturbed main narrator whose grasp of academia and the world around him is tenacious, over-reaching, or obstinately flamboyant. The idea of the split between pop and scholarly culture is a powerful one, although the author seems to approach it slowly and tentatively. The second section dealing with the Voynich manuscript is indeed a signal moment in this book, showing the author in full narrative splendour, as though the author regained control of the text with renewed confidence. The sequences move briskly, alternating with ponderous moments of reflection and resentment. The main character, Jonkil Calembour, is a fascinating type--a composite of various other figures fused into one, a character one wants to despise, but for whom one feels a kindred sympathy. Faucher prepares considerable groundwork for his second text, and it is an intriguing vehicle for ideas and musings. A bit long, but rewarding. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VLKIF3FJIJGM/[Astrid Jaida]

*****
The complicated weave of this author's text bears the stamp of a young French neorealist writer tempered with those episodic "mens momentanea" of stark lucidity. The homage to both Rabelais and Celine is more than obvious, as the author himself acknowledges this through the main narrator, Jonkil Calembour. The portrayal of mental illness is very well done--believable and not too overbearing or impossibly spectacular (especial kudos for the author's representation of aphasia). The prose can become alienating in parts, rippling with a kind of logophiliac robustness that might put off some general readers. The book ends on a bizarre, if not high, note, with the last narrative sequence engaging the impossibility of community as a world very much like our own sinks into dystopic pyjamas at the end of history. Codex Obscura takes some of the better literary machinations from the first book, Urdoxa, and amplifies / expands them in such a way as the reader may come away from this text feeling drained, intoxicated, disoriented, and perhaps even cognitively realigned. The introduction by Federman is also worth the read, and a fine prefatory match for the remainder of the book. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38WHV7E7A6HFU/[Astrid Jaida]

*****
After reading The Vicious Circulation of Dr. Catastrope: A Polemical Ensemble, I felt very much like washing my brain.

Not that my cerebellum was polluted by the book, but more that it was now stuffed with vivid language and portmanteaulogy hitherto unfamiliar to the grey, spongy organ. Also, it was itchy. I think I've caught mental crabs from its infected prose.

I suspect this is Faucher's intention, in writing what is meant to a cathartic, carcinogenic polemic, or perhaps a parody of the polemic, for a polemic is meant to establish the superiority of a point of view. The polemic has a long tradition, dating back to Cicero, and is associated with the writings of Voltaire, Nietzsche, and in the last century with such masters as Henry Miller and Hemingway. Yes, its a vicious satire, but don't make the mistake of thinking this book is a traditional novel. It uses some of the forms of novel - there is a narrator, for example, of whom we shall speak later - but it is not driven by narrative. It is driven by bile; hilarious at times, excruciating at others; Faucher is a master of the comic insult. The demented rant to end all rants.

The book follows the ravings, harangues, bombast, self-pitying bravado -- the polemic -- of four individuals, stitched together by a Rabelaisian narrator - to whit, a bawdy, satirical bastard who is full of it, but funny as heck. The four lunatics telling their various tales of woe are Dr. Catastrope, a medical doctor and author who has been unjustly imprisoned; Francois Coerlourde, a cantankerous old man and vile neighbour, French in upbringing and disposition, but sadly exiled in a part of New Orleans where people care about their lawns; Dr. Jonkil Calembour, the most deranged of the four, who is an academic literally at fisticuffs with his colleagues; and the quartet is rounded out by the somewhat sympathetic yet also paranoia-afflicted once-nearly-famous crooner, Vincent (Don Schixote.) It seems wrong not to include Vincent's dog in this cast of characters, simply because his voice is one of the saddest and most heartbreaking of the book.

Their four stories told, the four and the ham-fisted Narrator are brought together for a little discussion. It does not go well. Incidentally, the Narrator has been called many things including, to quote:

A miser of description

A toilsome narrative voice

An inveterate listmaker

A hackish dwarf

A purveyor of literary emesis...

Such is the virtuosity of Faucher's insult-machine. At the risk of having the some of the same epithets hurled at me, I would like to suggest that in the post-Vicious Circulation world, it only makes sense to institute the Faucher Scale of measuring insults, and of course, these would fall into the categories suggested by this book:

A Narration: a mild insult

A Vincent: somewhat hurtful

A Coerlourde: like having a large-fingered fisherman pull your nosehairs

A Catastrope: an insult so powerful, friends and neighbors stop speaking to you

A Calembour: a howling, bone-splitting ego-bash , or as it may become more popularly known: "I was Jonkilled."

So if you enjoy spicy language, gut-busting turns of phrase, and are not afraid of paranoia, I recommend you take a look. If you need strong narrative, and are perturbed by the exclamation mark, I'd suggest you think twice before cracking its covers, but you'll be missing a bit of virtuoso writing if you do. It is also an excellent way to put one's own paranoia in perspective. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWRGEY70V9C11/[Mark A. Rayner]

*****
The Twofold Vibration is a book that has yet to find an audience. It situates itself somewhere between a few different genres; between fact and fiction, history and futuricity, autobiograpy and science ficiton, pastiche and kitsch. Most importantly, i t situates itself inbetween the Holocaust and a departure from the planet which is a hybrid of science fiction and biblical messianism. The focus of the novel, the "old man" is investigated by two narrators (Namredef and Moinous: translated as Federman spelled backwards and "my mind" respectively) and one writer who makes an assemblage out of their information/ficitonal information (and perhaps misinformation) about the old man. The major task of these three is to find out why the old man is being deported to another planet. But with all the information we get about him we still don't get an answer. What we do get is a rich collage that includes both a missed encounter and a quasi-real encounter with the Nazis, as well as a narrative about how the old man returns to the camps later in his life (albeit accidentally). The accidentlal return to the camps begins when he meets a Jane Fonda type of woman of the 60s, a woman who is a film star slash political activist. The narrative itself is entirely borrowed from film which brings out its kitcshiness and a scence of non-reality. His involvement with this woman leads to taking risk after risk, and eventually gets him onto a plane for Europe where they go to gamble have sex etc. At some point, we are not sure, this "story" ends and another begins, this time with the two narrators. In this new plot line, in which we learn about the friendship and travels of these three, ther is another mad flight from caisno to casino. Eventually this leads them into Germany. One of the highlights of the journey is a Wagner opera out of which the old man attempts to make some obesrvations about the German people and Nazis, this proves futile. At some point, after this opera, he disspaears from his friends for a reason that is seemingly arbitrary: He had to "think" so he left. In the meantime they don't know if he is dead. After he departs from them, he accidentally meets other people whom bring out how, in the aftermath of the holocast (in a an age of media and mass efficiency) fiction and reality overlap. He meets a Jewish film producer from Holloywood who wants to make a film about the Holocast (though he never went through it) and his non-Jewish Grilfriend who is more a reflex than a person. She exerts a mechanical pity and has a likewise mechincal form of sex with the old man. At some point he leaves the couple and this branches off into another story of how he loses all his money and ends up in Paris, where they meet up with him again. At this point, the narrative takes a turn toward sci-fi and the detective novel. The narrators and the writer realize that the old man will depart very soon, therefore they make it their task to find out what he did wrong to get deported, and then perhaps they could make things right and save him. I won't tell what ends up happening in the end of the book, that is left to the reader to discern. But for now, I can say that the end of the book inter-weaves a messianic plot with epistmeological and exigetical questions concerning the meaning of existence and the search for meaning in general (and its diversions). Its a cross between Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49, eastern messianism, a sci-fi nightmare, and a Beckett Play where a plot is interrupted by a form of existential absurdity. The greatness of this ending has less to do with how it brings all of these genres together into a configuration, but in how it invents a discourse after the Holocaust that is concerned not just with the past, but with a future that is not just situated in a realistic manner, but in a fictional manner. It is for this reason that Federman should be reconsidered by Holocast critics like Hartman and Felman whom have taken such an interest in testimony that they have (unfortunatley) discounted work such as Federman's as promoting a form of "amnesia" (Hartman) and diversion that goes nowhere in contrast to Video testimony (at Yale for Hartman, Felman, and Langer) that has something to give to the next generation (what Langer calls "collected memory" a la James Young vs- "collective memory", that is public memory which, for Hartman, vulgarizes the Holocaust.) Hartman argues that Federman's work, like Video Testimony, challenges the notion of "false memory" ("collective memory") but falls short of testimony becase this is all it does. This bias does an injustice to Federman's work. Anyone who takes time to read this book will realize the injustice that has been done. At one point in this book, Federman (the first person narrator) writes that the Holocaust has become a concern for everyone, it is not just an event that Jews and Germans need to work through. This implies that this book should be read as a work of the imagination, the historical imagination. Federman shows us that the historical imagination can and should deal with the Holocast in way that figures out how it will travel into the future by way of a world where fact and fiction overlap, a world where Hollywood producers make films on the Holocast and where the old man is about to be deported for something no one knows about, a deportation that is like the deportation to Aushwitz (and not like it), a deportation that is at the same time thoroughly fictional and at the same time quite real. This book should be read in the sence that it meditates on a departure/deportation that hasn't yet happened, just as another great book of Federman's To Whom it May Concern is about an arrival that hasn't happened but is in the process of happening. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R34LRBCJNX3EYE/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0253189896&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[mechachem feuer]

Whodunnit? Who's Who? And, more importantly, "who the hell am I?" He solved the case of the missing parakeets. Now if he could only figure out who he was... Jules Feiffer works his easy-going wit and biting social satire into his second novel "Ackroyd," which begins as a parody of the Raymond Chandler school of detective fiction, but ultimately asks the age-old question: Is identity merely a metaphysical conceit? A shamus who may or may not be a sham, Roger Ackroyd (named after the victim in Agatha Christie's most shocking novel) is hired to investigate a case of writer's block by sports writer Oscar Plante. Over the course of five years, in between the bonhomie of Elaine's and tangling with unconventional femmes fatales, Ackroyd's personality begins to merge with his client's as he acquires his ex-wife, his mistress and, eventually, his craft. In "Ackroyd," Feiffer uses the detective genre to further his investigations into human neuroses, and to re-imagine the artist as a young sleuth forced to cope with a corrupt world. Originally published in 1977, and out of print for over 30 years, Fantagraphics Books is proud to reissue "Ackroyd" in a completely redesigned edition. - http://www.amazon.com/Ackroyd-Jules-Feiffer/dp/0380393476/[Amazon]

None of today's major papers would print the types of obituaries and other news items Feneon wrote in the early years of the 20th century. They are mordant, cynical, joyful over the most bizarre and violent mishaps, attitudes and deaths, and crafted with the precision of a poet.

This book contains roughly one thousand 'novels' or life stories (or death stories) that summarize in the fewest words possible what a person expired of, what a city council fought over (usually religious matters), how this or that soldier behaved, and details of suicide (disembowelled, drowned, hanged), murder (knifed, shot), accident (slipping into machinery, being run over by cars), and mutilation (a lot of acid gets thrown around). You may think none of this could be funny, but Feneon's compression of events and his tone combine to make this book a rich, if narrow, slice of human behaviour.

Quoting from it would be like eating peanuts - impossible to stop. If you read a handful of entries, then you'll know immediately if it's what you might like. Or, you could give it as a gift to that person who's hard to shop for. Highly recommended. Luc Sante's introduction is very well done, and provides all the context one needs. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KULOC31M0H5R/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590172302[Jeff Bursey]

"Ghosts—in a Martian department store. C. M. Kornbluth had this cute story idea, but he never got around to writing it. He might have taken it (adding the Martians) from The Brontës Went to Woolworths, by Rachel Ferguson (1892-1957).

Ferguson's novel is a send-up of Bloomsbury Group whimsy. "How I loathe that kind of novel which is about a lot of sisters. It is usually called They Were Seven or Three Not Out…" The narrator, Deirdre Carne, with her sisters, Katrine and Sheil, hold a séance in the Brontë village of Haworth. It calls up Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë, who visit their twentieth-century soul-sisters on Halloween. Charlotte and Emily go shopping at the local Woolworths. They don't much care for it, as Deirdre explains:

"Emily had one of her difficult fits right in the middle of the haberdashery… It was a queer shop [Charlotte wrote], much favoured with their custom by a class which I do not think to be our own. The attractions—no, I will not be sentimental—the attractions, then, are lights, variety of articles displayed, music, cleanliness and warmth (from whence obtained I do not know), but proving an evident lure to these families who know no better.…"

It may or may not be that Charlotte, Emily, and Anne were drawn to the happy Carne family because of the happiness they never enjoyed themselves. Of the three Carne sisters, Deirdre is the most affected by the quasi-hauntings. Woolworths is now every bit as ghostly as the whole Brontë family. But The Brontës Went to Walmart doesn't have the same ring to it—despite the alliteration." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2019/cur1903.htm[Graham Andrews]

*****
Argentinian author Macedonio Fernández (1874-1952), though largely unknown in the English-speaking world, has been something of a cult figure to several well-known Latin American authors of the twentieth century, including his protégé, Jorge Luis Borges. "The Museum of Eterna's Novel (The First Good Novel)" was commenced in 1925, went through five drafts, and remained in an unedited, unfinalized state at the time of Fernández's death. Like many other writers of the Modernist era, Fernández sought to reinvent the rules of the novel, starting with a very basic premise: Why risk love when death is inevitable? In tackling a question that has haunted countless thinkers before him, Fernández takes a deeply metaphysical approach that influences the very form of his greatest work. Dedicated to the caprices of the "Skip-Around Reader," whom Fernández claims will unwittingly find themself reading in order, "The Museum of Eterna's Novel" is a work of philosophical metafiction that uses its medium to explore the cosmic complexities of human life and human love.

The bulk of "The Museum of Eterna's Novel" is not a novel at all, but a series of prologues, some fifty in total, with titles such as "Prologue That Thinks it Knows Something, Not About the Novel (It's Not Allowed That), But About the Doctrine of Art," "The Man Who Feigned to Live" (which is one big footnote), and "For Readers Who Will Perish if They Don't Know What the Novel is About." Some meditate on the process of creating "The Museum of Eterna's Novel" from the perspective of both the author and the characters, including the cook who decided to resign and left the remaining characters with nothing to eat. Other prologues, in dense and difficult but ultimately rewarding prose, set up the mystical underpinnings of the main story.

The actual novel takes place on an estancia called "La Novela," owned by the President, who has gathered together his closest friends, including Maybegenius, Sweetheart, The Lover, Simple, the Gentleman Who Does Not Exist, and Eterna, who is both the President's love interest and the personification of idealized beauty and eternal love. There, the characters exist in the moment and only for each other, spending each day in one another's company and speculating on the nature of companionship and eternity. And here we come to the crux of the matter: the definition of "Totalove," the theme connecting all the musings and mind exercises of both prologues and novel. Fernández describes it as "the Highest form of Daydream." It is a rapturous state of passion that prevails only in the present and is the ultimate form of love: for a beloved, for friendship, or for art and beauty. The problem then becomes how to sustain a moment that is only that: a moment. The Action (in this case, the conquest of Buenos Aires by beauty, initiated by the President) is only one aspect of Totalove. There is also the anticipation, like the weeks building up towards Christmas and the sadness one feels after the presents have been opened and the rest of the day still remains. Once the Action has occurred, there is nothing left but loss or even death.

Hence the prologues: "The Museum of Eterna's Novel" is a novel that doesn't want to begin because in our beginning is our end.

Clearly, Macedonio Fernández was a fascinating, complicated man. "The Museum of Eterna's Novel" is a brilliant, thoughtful and frequently hilarious work that brings to mind everything from Mark Twain's irreverent humor to Jorge Luis Borges's mental labyrinths to Edgar Allen Poe's preoccupation with death and idealized beauty. I'll warn you: it's a difficult read, but if you're up to the challenge, this book is truly worth it. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R1KT9MADNF2Z8W/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934824062&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E.

*****
First published in French in 1950 in a limited edition of 100 copies, then republished in 1953 (and enthusiastically praised by André Breton), The Conductor and Other Tales is Jean Ferry's only published book of fiction. It is a collection of short prose narratives that offer a blend of pataphysical humor and surreal nightmare: secret societies so secret that one cannot know if one is a member or not, music-hall acts that walk a tightrope from humor to horror, childhood memories of a man never born, and correspondence from countries that are more states of mind than geographical locales. Lying somewhere between Kafka's parables and the prose poems of Henri Michaux, Ferry's tales read like pages from the journal of a stranger in a familiar land. Though extracts have appeared regularly in Surrealist anthologies over the decades, The Conductor has never been fully translated into English until now. This edition includes four stories not included in the original French edition and is illustrated throughout with collages by Claude Ballaré.

Jean Ferry (1906-1974) made his living as a screenwriter for such filmmakers as Luis Buñuel and Louis Malle, cowriting such classics as Henri-Georges Clouzot's Le Quai des orfèvres and script-doctoring Marcel Carné's Les Enfants du paradis. He was the first serious scholar and exegete of the work of Raymond Roussel (on whom he published three books) and a member of the Collège de 'Pataphysique. - http://www.amazon.com/Conductor-Other-Tales-Jean-Ferry/dp/1939663016/[Amazon]

*****
"I was standing in front of the Herald and somebody fired a shot and I saw a fat man turn slowly on one heel and fall to the sidewalk."

With this economic attention-grabbing opener, Michael Fessier's first novel promises the kind of proto-noir pleasures which, while entertaining, are hardly unique amongst 1930s thrillers. Within a few pages, however, the reader discovers that the book is no conventional murder mystery but in fact a fantasy – albeit one which elegantly hedges its bets before its poignant conclusion acknowledges that at least one of its characters is something other than human.

Fessier (1907-1988), the dedicatee of Horace McCoy's They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, was a screenwriter and the author of Clovis, a 1948 novel about a super-intelligent parrot.

Fully Dressed's 1935 printings are obscure enough that more than one book-dealer advertises the 1954 paperback as a first edition. Let us do them the kindness of assuming they are ill-informed rather than unscrupulous. Whatever edition you obtain, you're in for a treat. In exhilaratingly efficient prose – so lean and speedy that even a slowpoke like me can read the book in two hours – Fessier whips through his bizarre tale of a contemporary San Francisco penetrated by elements (and elementals) of the fantastic. His style is facile and fun but his gaze is unblinking and dyspeptic – there's a particularly disturbing scene involving the death of a child, for example – and this collision of moral stances, as much as the plot's cross-genre delights, makes this seventy year old novel feel considerably more modern and alive than much of the swollen pap that passes for contemporary fantastic literature. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2003/cur0301.htm[Peter Atkins]

Celia Fiennes rode around England in the late 17th century, staying with relatives (she was a grand-daughter of Viscount Saye and Sele) when she could and in verminous inns when she could not. Her journal is not a cook-book but Fiennes' habit of recording the smallest detail, no matter how banal, affords a glimpse into the practicalities of feeding oneself on the road. The lobsters and crabs caught near Poole are very sweet, she tells us, and Somerset cider is plentiful, although she disapproves of the way the orchardmen "press all sorts of apples together". It seems there were "cuvées" of cider in Celia's day. - http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/19/lawrence-norfolk-top-10-food-books[Lawrence Norfolk]

*****
Finney writes as though he had been possessed by the spirit of Ambrose Bierce, and to me, that's a GOOD thing. More of a short story than a novel (I last read it in the space of a single afternoon), "The Circus" shines light in many directions and is best appreciated after more than a single reading. Frankly, I'm astonished that it got published in the first place, and even more surprised that it here receives what amounts to a "Criterion Collection" sort of treatment, including reproductions of the illustrations by Boris Artzybasheff from the first edition.

The citizens of Abalone (plus a few visitors) are scathingly protrayed in amazingly understated passages. Presented with actual unicorns, satyrs, sea serpents, mermaids, and other "fabulous" creatures and miracles, hardly any of the townspeople can muster more than a yawn and a shrug. The ultimate spectacle, the sacrifice of a virgin to the giant bronze god of the rotten-to-the-core city of Woldercan, is absolutely a gem.

The use of several racial epithets does nothing to reflect on Finney - it doesn't take a super-astute reader to understand Finney is reflecting on his *characters*, yes, even in 1935.

As most reviewers have noted - this is NOT a children's book. And while the Tony Randall film of 1960 has some of its own charm (thank you, Barbara Eden!!), it is a kiddy-fied, watered-down version of this story. It was probably Finney's experience as a newspaperman that soured him on human nature - it must be an occpational hazard, since he shares that experience with the afore-mentioned Bierce as well as with another arch-cynic, Cyril Kornbluth of "Marching Morons" fame. The writing style varies (intentionally) from pulp to inspired to crisp and concise, sometimes all on a single page. Obviously not a book for everyone, but I find it refreshing, enlightening, and supremely entertaining. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R5C9ALXB45UG7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4871876640&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Mark Shanks]

"The only horror in this book is the horror I felt as to how drastically I was misled by various descriptions of the book. It is presented as sci-fi/fantasy, in reality is supposed to be a comedy/parody, but the joke is on the reader if you look at things like the cover statements: "A masterpiece of weird adventure" and "A brilliant and original novel of fantastic adventure." What a sick joke and incredibly false bit of marketing. This book has only the most minimal traces of sic-fi or fantasy, instead it's the story of two nitwits who spend the book getting drunk, hanging out with two grotesquely unattractive prostitutes, and in the meantime, poking fun at various social movements, capitalism, politics, etc., etc. If you want a somewhat amusing but mostly lame satire on society of the late 1930s, this might be interesting, but since it is originally a $1 paperback and is being sold for over $10 I advise against it." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MGIMFWR56BDE/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000858ER8[Doug H.]

*****
"The stories (and one novella) are set in and around Finney's invented township of Manacle, Arizona.

Finney covers such topics as a local manifestation of the "Black Dog" motif familiar in England's folklore; the bizarre offspring of a Gila Monster and a shrike; a curse on good-deed-doers; and a quest for buried treasure, wherein just about every character is related, and very few don;t want to kill each other.

Finney's craft is such that the possible preciousness of his style is outweighed by his creativity and good humor. These are fun stories to be read with one eyebrow cocked, for they were doubtless written tongue-in-cheek.

The cover blurb of the 1964 paperback is "The damndest book you ever read." I might not go THAT far, but it's a fun read, and comes from a guy whose creative net stretches across the Arizona horizon." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R399LG2AV4MFK5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1111771707[Mark Alfred]

*****
Ronald Firbank, whose forty-year lifespan (1886-1926) covers a particularly bountiful era of English prose artistry, is so eccentrically individual an author he almost seems to be a creature invented by Lewis Carroll or Edward Lear. His five short novels, collected in this New Directions Paperback edition, are utterly unclassifiable; no genre suggests itself when they are being read. His prose, as fastidiously styled as a coiffured poodle, as twee as an afternoon tea, is bewilderingly florid even beyond the standards of his contemporaries. With the descriptive proclivities of an interior decorator, he paints with all the colors on the palette; an orchid is not just an orchid but a "rose-lipped" orchid with a "lilac beard." England had not seen lyrical flamboyance like this since Oscar Wilde a quarter century before, and would not see it again until the ascendance of Freddie Mercury a half century later.

But Firbank's writing is not just fancy window dressing. His stories may look like fairy tales because of the whimsical characters and settings, but his narrative technique fractures the linearity of the plots by focusing on external details. In "The Flower Beneath the Foot," for example, the subject of the conversation in the first few pages is not immediately apparent, but disclosure gradually occurs over the course of the following chapters: His Weariness the Prince Yousef's mother, the Queen of some mythical Arabesque realm called the Land of Dates, disapproves of her son's desire to marry the humble convent-dwelling Mademoiselle de Nazianzi instead of Princess Elsie of England. Not until the final paragraph does Firbank dispel the story's genteel facade to reveal a passionately beating, and broken, heart.

Firbank's characters are garish works of art, most of them either impossibly frivolous nobles of theatrically exaggerated primness or paupers with pride and dignity. As in "The Flower Beneath the Foot," a common theme is star-crossed love, a romance between two people of different social stations. This love can be interracial, as it is in "Valmouth," a British colony with a climate so salubrious that the inhabitants live well over a hundred years, as well as in another novel with an evidently Caribbean setting and a controversial title which I refrain from typing so as not to have to wrestle with the Amazon censorship filter. Infatuation can also be grotesque, as it is in "The Artificial Princess," whose heroine, reluctantly betrothed to a foreign Crown Prince, unwittingly encounters the Devil on the night of her debut.

Firbank, one of the first of many English Catholic writers to emerge in the twentieth century, is comfortable setting one of his novels in Spain. "Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli" is self-explanatory, as the good cardinal, who allows aristocratic dogs to be baptized as a favor to wealthy patrons and disguises himself in the street as laity of either gender, risks being defrocked by the Roman church for his perceived sacrileges.

This is humor, but of a less obvious sort; unlike P.G. Wodehouse, who made a handsome living with his comical portraits of the upper class, Firbank doesn't target a specific group of people or stratum of society, nor does he seem interested in such petty substantiality. His fiction, insulated in a world unscarred by war and populated by dainty animated dolls, is an idyllic extension of reality, somehow a reminder of the limitless expanse of literature where formulas lose their validity and time stands still. Toss aside all your preconceptions, because these novellas will surprise you. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HUAA8SKVXE8Q/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811207994[A.J.]

"This is one of the great books about the Cold War, but seen from the perspective of Gyuri through his teens and twenties as he survives the grim first decade of Communism in Hungary, primarily by playing on a basketball team that keeps him out of the army.

The book is a series of vignettes, opening in 1955, then going back over the prior 9 years in the next 7 chapters. As the book returns to the mid-50s its first female character of consequence, the enigmatic Jadwiga, reappears. The last three chapters come to a climax in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. It is vividly portrayed, with some of the most poignant passages and insightful observations in this deeply insightful book.

The book is by no means a comedy, but the healthy servings of dark humor are priceless, such as Gyuri's comment about a lack of choice: "It was like Hungary being between Germany and the Soviet Union. What sort of a choice was that? Which language would you like your firing squad to speak?" When Fischer isn't amusing you with his sardonic wit, he delights you with colorful and creative phrases, such as a thrill "xylophoning" up Gyuri's spine.

One suggestion: brush up a little, if only for fifteen minutes with Wikipedia, on Hungarian history from WW II until the 1956 Revolution. Hungary did not just "become" communist, it came to be a communist country because of the actions of a small but wily and ruthless group, some of whose names pop up from time to time in the story, particularly Stalin's puppet, Matyas Rakosi.

As historical accounts will tell you, this was an era many did not survive. Gyuri and his best friend Pataki are survivors, each in very different ways, and this story of just how they attempt to hang on in the face of adversity is what makes the book so priceless." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HDTESDGVT632/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312278713[Tandem]

*****
Ostensibly, this book is about a pair of bank robbers whose robberies are based on various schools of philosophical thought (the positivist view: "I'm positive I want to rob this bank"; also check out the ludicrous Socratic-dialogue scene). That's part of it, yes, but the book is about so much more. It talks about the nature of fate, apocalyptic fears, the downfalls of academia, as well as two or three dozen other things. And it does so in a language that fluctuates between pretentious effusiveness and ironic silliness.

Hubert and Eddie Coffin (the title characters) are a modern day Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (not the Shakespeare but the Stoppard versions). Their brand of illogical logic is the only thing maintaining their existence. They are great characters caught up in a fascinating relationship. Like Ros and Guil, every attempt by one to understand the thoughts of the other comes back empty. That lasts for a while, and then Hube (a man missing more limbs than he's kept) goes and morphs into Tyler Durden. Fischer's style had me perplexed for awhile, but I think I've nailed it down. Think of a movie you know with hip dialogue and at least one torture sequence (my mind skips to 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club'). Now, imagine that story told to you in the first person by a bookish, lazy, witty, fat, balding, Cambridge-educated philosopher, whose inner dialogues are always terribly funny and exceedingly self-deprecating. Oh, and he has attention deficit disorder. I think that describes it pretty accurately.

My thoughts re all those Z's: coupled with much 'fin de millennium' talk, Fischer appears to be leading us towards some kind of apocalyptic end. Not to worry, for we will be reborn on the other side. Listen to his description of the car wreck that thrusts our narrator towards his bank robbing ways: "...I was ejaculated through the windscreen, reborn from the automotive womb." We have our experiences, he appears to be saying, and they change us (for the better?) when we get to the other side.

This is a good, quick read, punctuated with big ideas (or at least they seem like big ideas -- if the narrator doesn't take them seriously, should I?), and great comic set pieces. It somehow manages to build all this up to a very suspenseful ending, which it pulls off with great panache. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6X18OC2SPE4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684830795&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Mike Stone]

*****
THE MURDER LEAGUE (1970) by Robert L. Fish (American, 1912-1981) is a short comic crime novel, centered around the fortunes of three impoverished elderly British mystery novelists named Carruthers, Simpson, and Briggs.

As the rear cover blurb indicates on the copy I own, the trio decide to use their authorial wits to run a little murder-for-hire business, charging £1,000 per victim until they have accumulated £10,000, which they estimate will support them comfortably in their remaining years. They place an advertisement in the London TIMES, receive a good number of responses, successfully bump off nine people who "needed to be gotten rid of," and then run into a major glitch with their final job.

The final two-fifths of this book deal chiefly with the murder trial of one of the elderly writers, especially the brilliant legal defense conducted by Sir Percival Pugh (pronounced "poo" or "pyoo" or "pug"?) ... who demands, in advance, and gets a fee of £10,000 from the other two League members. Readers who attempt to guess how Sir Percival will win the case (a matter that's never in doubt) will almost certainly be greatly surprised--and pleased--with Fish's solution.

In my judgment, many of the early chapters drag a bit and are not among the best examples of Fish's comic writing (see POSTSCRIPT below). Further, Fish's choice of victims is occasionally weak for a book with an essentially comic center: it is not always clear to readers why the victim "deserved" to die. (Fish, however, does do a MUCH better job in his choice of victims than Leo Bruce did in his 1936 comic crime novel CASE FOR THREE DETECTIVES.)

The surprise FINAL-TWIST ending to this novel will probably satisfy most readers, and most will also find Fish's phrasing quite amusing on a number of occasions. (My own favorite line is when Sir Percival Pugh is questioning a witness about "Pinky," who apparently has been stealing bottles of expensive Scotch from his boss: "[Is it possible that] he concluded that the embolism in the arteries of his illegal traffic was you?")

Weighing the strengths and weaknesses of this comic crime novel, I would give it a solid "B" grade, particularly since its weaknesses occur mostly in its first half.

POSTSCRIPT: Robert L. Fish won the Mystery Writers of America's EDGAR Award for his first novel, THE FUGITIVE (1962). His novel MUTE WITNESS (1963) was made into the film BULLITT staring Steve McQueen (1968). My own favorite "Fish stories" are his 32 hilarious parodies of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, originally published in ELLERY QUEEN'S MYSTERY MAGAZINE and finally collected together in SCHLOCK HOMES: THE COMPLETE BAGEL STREET SAGA (1990). - http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4MO4PGEHLXF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J90EUBW&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[David R.

"Who would have thought that the third millennium would blast off with a sci-fi novel written in Scots? Matthew Fitt’s debut leaves granny’s hieland hame behind and claims the Scots language for writing that is out of this world. Fitt is one of the people behind Itchy Coo, which publishes Scots language books for children. With But n Ben A-Go-Go, Fitt takes the playfulness of his work with bairns into darker territory, writing a work of dystopian fiction that is surely the first of its kind.

But n Ben A-Go-Go is set in the year 2090, half a century since the polar ice caps melted leaving most of Scotland under water. What is left of the population live in a group of floating cities, or parishes, known collectively as Port. A deadly virus called Sangue de Verde has made physical love a thing of the past. Cyberjanny Paolo Broon has watched his infected wife deteriorate, one of many hundreds locked in coffin-like life support machines and kept alive so that the virus will be unable to spread further. As Paolo and Nadia had not even kissed outside cyberspace, his pain is made worse by the knowledge that his wife has been unfaithful. Paolo receives a message from his estranged father and sets off believing that he can lead him to Nadia’s cure.

By bringing Scots into contact with this post-apocalyptic future world, Fitt creates a prose that crackles with energy and invention. Like other science fiction writers, he creates a new language to describe this world but his verbal pyrotechnics are even more startling in Scots. But n Ben A-Go-Go shows us that the Scots language can describe worlds as various and exotic as the imaginations of those who use it." - https://www.list.co.uk/article/2741-matthew-fitt-but-n-ben-a-go-go-2000/[Niall O'Gallagher]

*****
"My wonder upon discovering the 'Book of Fish' remains with me yet."

Richard Flanagan's opening line may resonate with readers as they polish off the final sentence of his novel "Gould's Book of Fish."

The "Book of Fish," a book within the book, is discovered in a junk shop by Sid Hammet, an amiable con man in Tasmania, who makes a sort of living ("if it wasn't that good, nor was it all that bad") bilking porky American tourists by selling them old crap marketed as "antiques."

Digging through a pile of ratty-tatty women's magazines, Hammet finds a book that positively glows, I tell ya -- a frenzied narrative interspersed with fabulous watercolors of sea life. Upon opening this dizzying mad rush of a book, Hammet is hooked!

"It was, I must admit, a dreadful hodgepodge, what with some stories in ink layered higgledy-piggledy over others in pencil, and sometimes vice versa. Upon running out of space at the end of the book, the writer seemed to have simply turned it around and, between the existing lines, resumed writing -- in the opposite direction and upside down -- more of his tales. ... The sum of such chaos was that I seemed to be reading a book that never really started and never quite finished."

He takes his find to be appraised by historians and publishers and experts who judge the book a very colorful fraud -- a fish story, as it were -- "the insignificant if somewhat curious product of a particularly deranged mind of long ago."

That mind belongs to William Buelow Gould, a convict sentenced to Van Diemen's Land. Some of you may recognize from imperial history the name of an infamous British prison colony. Some of you may have just heard the U2 song.

Gould's story becomes an obsession for Hammet, who persists in trying to get it recognized in the face of derision, critical abuse and drubbings at the pub. Then, just like the one that got away, the "Book of Fish" is gone, vanished from the bartop where Hammet left it on a trip to the toilet. Meaningful to no one but him, the story bubbles and boils in Hammet's fevered brain until he sets out to re-create the "Book of Fish" from memory. This tale, filtered through the perspective of two madmen (three if you count Flanagan), is slightly divergent from the history of Gould you'd find on the Wikipedia (which never lies).

Gould arrives in Van Diemen's Land in the 1800s, condemned not to a relatively quick death by hanging but to a relentless life in hell. The prison shipyards are ruled by the Commandant, driven mad by a prodigious intake of mercury, laudanum and opium and by an ambition "as enormous as his appetites, both dietary & carnal, & it was no less than the creation of a nation that would have as its heart the city-state he was already building the foundations for, with him for its Father." The Commandant's port settlement is populated by lunatics, grotesques and the scum of England forced into slave labor.

In his leisure time, when he's not being beaten or half-drowned in his seaside cell below the high water mark, Gould writes about his life in bondage. "It had simply become a bad habit, as inescapable & as wretched as scratching my licy balls."

Such accounts by convicts are forbidden by law and risk savage punishment. Using purloined bits of paper and blood picked from his own scabby flesh, Gould creates his defiant art. "If I had a bottle of good Indian ink, I'd be a hell of a lot happier, & in somewhat less pain. On the other hand, mine is far from a black & white story, so perhaps putting it down in a scarlet fashion is not so inappropriate. Please don't be appalled, compared to most of the vile crap that comes out of my body these days ... my blood is really quite pure & beautiful, & it reminds me that something is always pure & beautiful, if you will just look beneath the scabs & sores."

Gould is allowed by his captors to paint. He shows a certain talent for artistic forgeries that can be exported and sold and for still lifes that British officials can present to their mistresses as gifts. And for fish: In his painting, Gould finds subtle, undetectable ways to reflect the horrors of his surroundings. His piscine portraits express "my own fear at this cracked world in which I & they & everything was trapped."

Gould's work catches the eye of Tobias Achilles Lempriere, a corpulent, grub-like surgeon who appreciates the "scientifick" detail. The Surgeon recruits Gould in an effort to catalog Nature, starting with the fish, in preparation for that grand day when science supplants art and assumes its rightful supremacy in the mind of enlightened man.

Gould guzzles the Surgeon's rum and nods a lot.

"It sounded suspiciously like an attempt by the Surgeon ... to recreate the natural world as a penal colony, with me, the gaoled, now to play the part of turnkey. Still, I had had worse offers."

But Gould finds his assignment taking on a personal meaning. It's more than a means to escape arbitrary floggings. He begins to take the job seriously, at least the artistic aspects of it. He's making an honest effort to capture the essence of fish.

As Gould's talents develop, the Commandant's insanity progresses:

"The more he advanced in his belief in his manifest destiny, the more he declined in the practice of sense. His talk became of impossibilities -- of building a temple of odours; of lifting the Penitentiary into the air by the power of levitation, so escape would be impossible except in balloons; of developing mesmerism as an offensive weapon for his army by raising a regiment of spiritualists who would stand in the front row of great battles willing the other side to lose."

The Commandant borrows Gould from the Surgeon to record in a series of elaborate murals the glories of the Commandant's would-be empire. While sidelined from his fish study, the Surgeon loses his spirit for the project (along with some other beloved equipment), turning instead to the harvesting of Aboriginal heads for study.

But Gould can't let the fish go. The painting of sea life is no longer a simple shelter against sadism. Gould's art has become an obsession, an essential -- and endlessly frustrating -- sustenance.

"The more I looked at those sad creatures, still dying, the occasional mortal flap of the tail or desperate heave of the gills signaling their silent horror was not yet ended, the more I looked into the endless recesses of their eyes, the more something of them began to pass into me" while "some small part of me, without me willing it, was beginning a long, fateful journey into them!"

His painting is his life, the only thing he has left, the only thing he cares about. And in this setting of merciless suffering, an awakening of passion through art is dangerous, perhaps even deadly.

"I knew in order to survive & prosper it was important to feel nothing for anyone or anything, & I knew I wanted to survive & prosper. But because of my newfound proximity to what hitherto had been little more than stench wrapped in slime & scale, I began to dream that there was nothing in the extraordinary universe opening up in front of me, not a man or woman, not a plant or tree, not a bird or fish, to which I might be allowed to continue remaining indifferent."

"Gould's" is a good book to experience with a buddy -- providing your buddy is of stern constitution and not easily repulsed. Flanagan is so clever and puckish in his wordplay that there are passages that could be read one way or could be read another and were probably intended to support multiple interpretations.

"As with the skin of a bastard trumpeter caught at night, the book's cover was now a mass of pulsing purple spots."

That sentence may bring to mind a "Jackass"-type prankster/musician thrashed black and blue by a mob of angry, interrupted slumberers. But there is also a trumpeter fish that glows purple in the dark. Shakespeare, an incorrigible punster, might have liked that one.

And even if all of us in the audience are wrong, it's all part of the natural process of writing and reading.

"A book at its beginning may be a new way of understanding life -- an original universe -- but it is soon enough no more than a mere footnote in the history of writing, overpraised by the sycophantic, despised by the contemporary, and read by neither. Their fate is hard, their destiny absurd. If readers ignore them they die, and if granted the thumbs-up of posterity they are destined forever to be misconstrued."

Gould's plight as an artist goes beyond mere miscommunication issues. His account flies in the face of an unassailable official record that praises the European conquerors for their compassion, nobility and the unflagging, saintly patience required by the endeavor to enlighten Australia's savages and England's societal dregs. In the only history that counts, the written word -- a great power for liberation -- is malignantly warped to enslave.

Flanagan philosophizes about the simultaneous futility and absolute necessity of artistic expression. Each of us lives in our own little bubble of perception, and no one, no matter how intimate, sees the outside world exactly the way we do. Or sees us the way we see ourselves. Art -- imperfect, open-to-interpretation-by-idiots art -- is perhaps the best bridge between bubbles that we have. As badly as I believe I've fumbled this review, I kept writing. I've failed to convey how exciting and special (and heinously gruesome) this book is, but I had to take a shot at it in the hopes of luring new readers for Flanagan to shake and shock and amaze and engage. Some of us feel a compulsion to communicate that's unsatisfied by a click of the Like button or an emoticon. Often such communication is a failure.

But we keep casting our lines.

"ARTISTS. All charlatans. Boast of their disinterestedness (old-fashioned). Express astonishment that they dress like everybody else (old-fashioned). They earn insane amounts, but fritter it all away. Often asked to dine out. A woman artist cannot be anything but a whore."

Flaubert's satirical reference work, the Dictionnaire des Idées Reçues, reveals in a marvellously condensed form the writer's attitude toward the French bourgeois society in which he was brought up. It is a sort of guidebook to19th-century crassness, triteness, pomposity, and irrationalism decked out to look like reason. Clearly Flaubert regarded his own social class with a mixture of detestation, boredom, and intense fascination. He found both comic and tragic possibilities in this cultural stratum, which he mined relentlessly for the realistic details of his novels Madame Bovary, L'éducation sentimentale, and Bouvard et Pécuchet.

In the early 1850s (while at work on Madame Bovary) Flaubert referred in several letters to his "sottisier," a compendium of trite opinions, of the ideas that "ferment in the brains of the brainless." Flaubert never published his dictionary, although in a letter to his mistress, Louise Colet, he hinted that he intended to do so eventually. Topical dictionaries and digests of knowledge were popular in France, especially among the upwardly mobile, who may have fancied that posession of snippets of miscellaneous information conferred a patina of erudition, and made one's dinner-party conversation more sparkling. Flaubert must have enjoyed parodying the entire concept of the "authoritative" reference work; his private compendium was arranged in alphabetical order, with ludicrous cross-references, secondary definitions (which generally contradict the first one), and a tone of pompous omniscience.

The Dictionary's stock of platitudes served Flaubert as a sourcebook for the opinions of many characters in the novels Madame Bovary, L'éducation sentimentale, and Bouvard et Pécuchet. This work, as well as being enjoyable and witty reading for its own sake, is an indispensable artist's eye view of mid-nineteenth century bourgeois mores, and also provides some insight into the paradox the author struggled with in his novels: how to create pure art out of pure vulgarity. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7RX5AP0MJCM/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081120054X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[S.

"I was drawn to this book by the truly splendid title, but don't think this is a tale of desperate survivors of an air crash or some such incident; no this is set amid the enchanting spires of Oxford University. We meet the members of the dangerously exclusive, `Shadow Faculty of Gastronomic Science. This is a dining society of Oxford Dons who make it their life's aim to turn gastronomy into the science they believe it truly is and to taste all that the world of culinary delights has to offer - and drink a fair bit too.

Then one of the members - Professor Arthur Plantagenet gets the unwelcome news of his sudden and unexpected demise due to a dicky heart. Undeterred by this quite catastrophic news, he sees it as a way to further push the envelope of culinary frontiers - and comes up with a plan. This he entrusts into a meticulous and detailed will of what is to be done with his `remains' once he has shuffled off his `mortal coil'; oh and he leave a rather generous legacy too.

Soon the doctors are proven right and his plan swings into action, as well as the normal directions one of the more galling parts is that he wants to know what `we' taste like and he is only too ready to donate his body, or at least a bit of it, to the field of gastronomic inquiry. That's right he wants them to eat him - and make some tasting notes too. What follows is a tale of subterfuge, modest rebellion, lots of eating, some marvellous recipes and some rather ungallant behaviour by certain individuals.

I really enjoyed this book, Ian Flitcroft has a way with words that is almost Wodehouse in that the humour is both dry and full of wit and insight. The characters really come alive - except for Professor Plantagenet of course - and the story is totally addictive. An absolute joy of a read from start to finish. You should also read the notes at the back as they add to and explain even more of the motivation for this original and rewarding piece of literature." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHKO6GAP7YH81/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909593591[Tommy Dooley]

"31,450,670. No, that's not a mistranslated title to Alfred Bester's famous story, "5,271,009." It's the actual name of the protagonist of the debut novel by a talented Greek sf author who is, sadly, little-known in Anglophone territories. Diamandis Florakis, still with us today, produced ten novels in his "Decalogy of Eschatological Utopia," or, to employ his other series designation, "Ten Romances of Existential Anarchy." (My thanks to friend and editor Angelos Mastorakis for help with this research.) If subsequent volumes rival the first, it's a monumental accomplishment.

Our numerically named hero (colonized planets, days of the week, and regions of the globe are all designated with equal blandness) lives in "computer generation 2,354," an era thousands of years removed from ours. Thanks to the discovery of the nexus of evil in the human brain in generation 1,355 and the perfection of an operation for its removal, a "utopia of ethical and material paradise" now reigns—at least so believes the High Quotient, the leader of the human race. But if so, why are suicides exponentially increasing, as the populace's "feeling 1" ratings plummet?

When 31,450,670 discovers that his operation was faulty and that he possesses all the old vices—including murderousness—a battle ensues for the soul of humanity.

With a definite Age of Aquarius vibe, the novel still remains timely, pondering such eternal conundrums as this: "Murdering, they spoke of peace; in envisioning peace, they warred." Stylistically reminiscent of Zamiatin, Lem, Bunch, and van Vogt, the book reads like the libretto for the next great rock opera by the Flaming Lips." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2008/cur0806.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*****
The Frenchman Gabriel De Foigny wrote this imaginary voyage novel set in terra incognita (Australia) in the 1670's, fifty years before the appearance of "Gulliver's Travels". This early lost race/science fiction novel has many attractions. First and perhaps foremost, it is a rousing adventure yarn replete with perils among a strange race of semi-human hermaphrodites; daring escapes; fights with monstrous creatures; and well-realized battle scenes. Second, it is a brilliant philosophical and sociological work which envisions a very strange, proto-communistic culture that is brought intensly to life. De Foigny uses this race of hermaphrodites as a foil to examine 17th century Europe's concepts of sexuality and society. It is amazing that in the early days of the novel, with very few prototypes to turn to, De Foigny would attempt a work that succeeds as an adventure story, a delightful fantasy, a dark dystopia, and an examination of the philosophical and mor! al tenets of the era, but De Foigny's remarkable novel works on these levels and more. Briefly, the book's protagonist, Sadeur, is carried to the shores of terra incognita in the clutches of a huge, predatory, Roc-like bird of prey. He is rescued by a civilized race that vaguely resembles humans. The individuals are eight feet tall, of a reddish hue, are hermaphrodites, and many have a second set of arms. Their social framework is equally unfamiliar, being communal and socialistic. All things are owned in common, there are no personal possessions, and human emotions such as covetousness, competetiveness, and even love are held in contempt. These creatures also have a drug culture, and their own strange sciences, and they have acheived the art of creating living creatures, although these creatures have fatal flaws that allow them to live only for several days. From the beginning Sadeur is loathed for his unisexual nature and because he is suspected to be a member of the ! hated human race, and he only manages to survive through th! e patronage of a high minded and powerful sage. After an exposition of the strange society he finds himself among (this is a common feature of lost race novels, and would be a bit tedious if De Foigny's creation were not so fascinating), and a string of adventures including the incursion of "sea monsters" that turn out to be a convoy of European explorers that are massacred after a savage battle, Sadeur's patron dies and things become dicey for him. The hermaphrodites wage war against a tribe of humans on a neighboring island, and Sadeur is forced to fight against his own kind. His heart is not in it, and after rescuing one of the human women and hiding her, he is caught by several of the hermaphrodites engaging in a sexual dalliance with the woman. The level of disgust the hermaphrodites feel over this discovery can barely be expressed. After killing the woman, they imprison Sadeur and condemn him to a ritualistic death. Sadeur escapes from this predicament by! means of secretly taming one of the huge predatory birds, which carries him out of the country in the same manner in which he entered it. It is hoped that this thumbnail sketch successfully conveys some of the interest of this fascinating work. My review will be worthwhile if helps convince a few more readers to find their way to this obscure and unjustly neglected novel. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2VVC7DJMJV1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815625715&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

Folengo, Teofilo

http://www.folengo.com/[Works of Teofilo Folengo]

*****
Teofilo Folengo (1491–1544) was born in Mantua and joined the Benedictine order, but became a runaway monk and a satirist of monasticism. In 1517 he published, under the pseudonym Merlin Cocaio, the first version of his macaronic narrative poem Baldo, later enlarged and elaborated. It blended Latin with various Italian dialects in hexameter verse, inventing a deliberately droll language whose humor depends on the mixture of high and low tonalities. An important example of the mock-heroic epic, the work was a model for Rabelais and was frequently reprinted.

Baldo, the hero of these picaresque adventures, is a descendant of French royalty who starts out as something of a juvenile delinquent. The poem narrates episodes that include imprisonment; battles with local authorities, pirates, shepherds, witches, and demons; and a journey to the underworld. Throughout Baldo is accompanied by various companions, among them a giant, a centaur, a magician, and his best friend Cingar, a wickedly inventive trickster (“practicus ad beffas”).

This edition provides the first English translation of this hilarious send-up of ancient epic and Renaissance chivalric romance. - http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674025219[HUP]

*****
"Baldo possesses an explosive energy and playfulness that rarely lags and often overtakes any effort at philosophy. Asides attacking the clergy, lawyers, and civil authorities see light but never fully develop, as Folengo seems all too eager to turn his poem into the literary equivalent of a comic action flick. Battles are relayed in a crackling prose – one almost expects to see “Blam!” and “Pow!” rendered graphically as in TV’s Batman - and it’s easy to imagine the poem being read aloud to a gape-mouthed audience hanging blow-by-blow on every adventure. The poem’s low humor is often laugh-out-loud funny, its pranks and gags leaving one feeling that in such humor there’s nothing new under the punch-drunk sun. For example early in the second volume, Boccalo, a clowning member of the group, convinces another character to search Baldo’s chest, from which the astonished man, in a terrific Harpo Marx bit,  “extracts all sorts of stuff…a bulb, a mirror, an inkwell, a bell, a shard of a plate, a bridle, part of a truss and the bits of candle which are left for the altar boy to gather after Mass.” Some of the ruses played by Baldo and his merry band of delinquents consist of malicious practical jokes ending in death or injury, but others have an irresistible, ribald humor. In one such scam, Baldo’s closest accomplice Cingar dupes another character into selling vats of human waste disguised during the sales “training” period with a deceptive layer of honey. In a scene later borrowed by Rabelais, Baldo and his companions, fleeing Italy on a ship filled with three thousand sheep and their shepherds, commandeer the vessel when Cingar concludes a deal to purchase one of the sheep then promptly tosses it overboard, causing all the other sheep to leap after it into the sea." - http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2015/04/nothing-can-be-found-more-fun-than-this.html[Seraillon]

*****
"Fantástico! Brazilian author Rubem Fonseca's High Art is among the greatest of Latin American boom novels. I’m not alone in my praise – in his glowing New York Times book review, Mario Vargas Llosa judged the author’s work a stunning accomplishment, a combination of amusing detective novel and an elegant literary experiment of the topmost aesthetic and intellectual order.

A fictional fiesta. Certainly one of the high arts of High Art is the art of breathtaking storytelling. To attempt a synopsis would be ridiculous as there are too many colorful stylistic spirals and as many unexpected curves and curls as there are feathers on a Hyacinth Macaw or Toco Toucan. Rather, I'd like to share my excitement for this book that I've read three times and counting by noting a number of captivating characters and dazzling details:

Mandrake the lawyer: The novel’s first-person narrator goes by the cartoonish name of Mandrake. We can judge such a name as a parody of pulp detective fiction. He’s a criminal lawyer in Rio and is teamed up with a hardworking Jew by the name of Wexler. All the many references to Wexler’s Jewishness can also be seen as a parody, this time of social stereotyping. Mandrake doesn’t work nearly as hard as Wexler when it comes to defending clients because he’s continually sidetracked by investigating the truth behind the crimes he’s drawn into.

Mandrake the irresistible playboy: Actually, Mandrake has to deal with another major distraction: beautiful women. His leading girlfriend at the moment is tall, thin, ravishing Ada with her long legs and neck slightly curved forward. Ada would like nothing more than to wed Mandrake and start a family. Good luck, dear lady! Although you are in the lead, there are at least two or three or four (I lost count!) other attractive, vivacious sexpots who keep knocking on the playboy's door.

Mandrake, the eccentric: How eccentrically oddball? One morning our Sherlock Holmes wannabe accompanies two real detectives at the apartment of a rich socialite. They find the young lady’s bloated corpse on her bed, having been strangled sometime the previous evening. And where is Mandrake’s attention? Why, he’s making remarks about the fashionable décor, all the furniture, paintings, lamps and carpets speaking to an owner bathing in luxury. And while the head detective is busy gathering evidence, Mandrake scrutinizes the magazine covers on the coffee table: Amiga, Status, Donald Duck and then pleads with the other detective to let him feed the exotic tropical fish in the aquarium lest they go belly up.

Camilo Fuentes: An enormous, powerful Bolivian from Indian stock, a man who doesn’t mess around when it comes to conducting his business trafficking drugs for gangsters and seeking out targets to be murdered. Camilo especially hates Brazilians since they have always looked down on him as a Bolivian and as an Indian, as someone who is poor and badly dressed, but most of all, he despises Brazilians because, in his eyes, they are all disgusting dogs.

Hermes: Specialist in Persev, a code word for a set of tactics and skills of knife handling and knife combat. In the aftermath of being stabbed himself, Mandrake seeks out Hermes, a former client who owes him one since the Rio lawyer got the knife expert off a murder charge. Mandrake takes his combat lessons to heart and from this point forward wears a leather shoulder strap for his new Randall. Rubem Fonseca delves into the details on what it means to make a knife an extension of your very arm. "Hermes reached out his hand and picked up the knife. A friend of mine raises birds. I once saw him stick his hand in a cage and grasp a bird to transfer him to another cage. This was the way Hermes held the Randall, as it were alive, capable of escaping from his hand."

Iron Nose: Nickname for the black dwarf José Zakkai, kingpin of a gangster mob, a man keen on accumulating and wielding power. When asked his specialty, Zakki answered: “Survival. When I was born my mother took one look at my hands and fainted. I had webbing between my fingers. . . But here I am, a first-class chatterbox, though I still haven’t grown much.” Even hardened gangsters and murderers realize Iron Nose is not a man to laugh at (although his cover is working as a clown for a circus) – you just might be forced to eat huge hard-shelled cockroaches if you don’t give Nose the information he wants, fast.

Rafael: Knife fighter and professional killer, a students of the Professor (Hermes) whose hobby is the cultivation of roses. “I have more than a hundred and fifty different species. My mother had the prettiest roses I’ve ever seen, to this day. And I think they’re the most sublime flower of all.”

Ricardo Mitry and Lima Predo: both men wealthy, completely self-centered, cruel and vicious – in the grand tradition of Latin American multigenerational tales, we are even treated to the particulars of their family genealogy. During one memorable party at his apartment, Mitry brings out a silver tray containing several small mirrors with fine lines of white powder along with a crystal vial filled with pills of every color. In attendance are two young glamorous prostitutes, Titi and Tata, well dressed, well tanned and absolutely scrumptious. During a dance in the nude, Mitry pinches Tata’s ass and proclaims to all: “The newest dream of the powerful – that flesh should have the durability of synthetic rubber.”

Pop Culture: One hip, shapely Rio goddess wears a shirt that says: COCA-COLA – THE PAUSE THAT REFRESHES, another upper class call girl sports one reading: I (big read heart) NEW YORK. There’s references galore to popular movies, both old time black and white and current ones playing in living color: Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Vincent Price in The House of Usher, the pornographic Orgy of the Perverts. Radio programs, television shows, videocassettes, glossy magazines, sensationalist newspapers - as we turn the pages, no mistaking the fact we are in hopped-up, with-it, trendy Rio.

High Culture: Not only a plethora of general historical and literary allusions but more specifically, Ajax, Zeus, Achilles are among the copious references to all things Greek: Greek mythology, Greek history, even Greek philosophy. As Mario Vargas Llosa acknowledged in his review, such mentions and citations adds a certain dignity and aesthetic dimension to Rubem Fonseca’s novel.

High Art: As in deft, nimble style, as in a story jam-packed with such flamboyant characters and absorbing scenes, the book will almost hop out of your hands to dance the samba. Is there any question about how I can’t recommend High Art highly enough?" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAECAGTUJJ0X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060155728[Glenn Russell]

*****
A crime novel with literary elements, or a literary novel involving crime? That’s the question posed by a reading of “The Lost Manuscript” by Rubem Fonseca. First published in 1988, the novel was a bestseller in Fonseca’s home country of Brazil, as well as in Italy and Mexico. The English edition I read was published in 1997 in Britain, translated by Clifford Sanders.

The hero of the story is unnamed. He is a film producer based in Rio de Janeiro who’s been producing commercials for two years and is suddenly presented with the opportunity to film and direct a documentary in Germany about the early Soviet writer Isaac Babel. He’s becoming obsessed with all things Babel, reading her story, every scrap of information about the writer who served in the Red Cavalry (a Cossack unit. Even though Babel was Jewish), was a celebrated writer in the early Soviet period, and then was arrested in 1939 and executed in 1940, one more victim of Stalin’s purges.

Very early in the novel, the hero is approached by a woman who works in Rio’s carnival. She thrusts a small package into his hands and asks him to keep it safe. He’s never seen her before and isn’t quite sure how she selected him. Inside the package is some 30 stones, which appear to be costume-jewelry quality but turn out to be something far more valuable.

He holds on to the package, and then learns the woman has been murdered. Then the doorman of his apartment building is murdered right in front of the hero’s door and the apartment ransacked. Someone knows or suspects he has the stones. Gradually he discovers that the stones are part of a major smuggling operation.

He flies to West Berlin, as much to flee the smugglers as the meet his producer. But the producer has something else in mind – to send the hero into East Berlin to obtain a lost manuscript of what is said to be the only novel by Babel. Someone has it and wants to sell it for American dollars. The hero makes the transaction, barely escaping the East German secret police. But instead of turning it over to the producer, he flees with it back to Rio.

The story is one of lost and smuggled things, the lengths to which people will go to satisfy their obsessions, and the violence lurking just below the veneer of society and culture. It includes a few graphically sexual scenes, but fewer than what’s contained in Fonseca’s collection of short fiction, “The Taker and Other Stories.”

Fonseca began writing later and he specialized in crime writing. He lived most of life in Rio de Janeiro. He became a police officer in suburban Rio in 1952, writing the crime reports that would later become the basis for his stories. He studied business administration at New York University from 1953 to 1954, returning to the police force in Rio until 1958. He began writing stories in the early 1960s, and published his first collection, “The Prisoners,” in 1963. His works were often censored by the Brazilian military government for their violent and sexually graphic content. Fonsecae received numerous prizes for his writing, including the Luís de Camões Prize for Literature and the Juan Rulfo Literature Prize for Latin American and Caribbean Literature. He died in April of 2020.

“The Lost Manuscript” works as a crime novel, and its works as a literary novel. It bears the influence of the high tide of magic realism in Latin America, as it was published shortly after the tide had crested. But it is still a thrilling story, full of literary discussions, criminal twists and turns, and a narrative that succeeds. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T9AKYFNFEMS4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl[Glenn Young]

"Jeffrey Ford is one of the best writers you've never heard of. His fiction is complex and rich, the antithesis of pulp. His work resonates so strongly for me that I come back to him again and again, something I rarely do for fiction.

Cley is a physiognomist, someone who can judge the personality of a person by examining their cranial features. And boy is he an arrogant prick. And yet, I somehow, bizarrely, rooted for him anyway. He does some absolutely horrible things--one in particular made me actually cringe and shudder while reading.

He does pay for his sins, however, but I can't say that I ever truly like the character all that much. Even after he reforms, he seems to be still mostly a prick. But he is nonetheless a compelling prick.

The strongest part of the novel, I think, is Ford's ability to evoke the colorful and weird imagery of the world. There are so many strange elements--a thinking, plotting monkey, a monstrous mechanical man with a heart of gold, a woman so hideous her face can kill--I kept wondering where the hell he comes up with this stuff. This is not standard fantasy or sci fi fare; it's imaginative and bizarre, and I was not able to predict where the hell the story was going at any time, for the most part. Which is a good thing.

Ford's writing is lyrical and evocative. I first stumbled across his work in a short story collection. His story "The Honeyed Knot" was so amazing that I still read it aloud to my students every year, and it sparks MUCH discussion and passion. What makes it even more powerful is that Ford swears that it's a true story (I don't believe him, but it's still fun to tell students that it's 'true'). 'Physiognomy' is equally good, but different. It has a more poetic quality to it, a quality that coincides well with the content.

As an aside, I met Mr Ford at the 2011 World Fantasy Convention where he was doing a reading. I expected a slight, rumpled, college professor type with tired eyes and a sensitive soul. I don't know about Mr Ford's soul, but my mental image of him wasn't even close. He turned out to be a pretty big guy with a thick Long Island accent, and if I ever met up with him in a bar, I wouldn't want to piss him off. (But we did chat for a minute or two and he seemed immensely likable. He also expressed unbelievable patience with a guy who was having him sign a zillion books, obviously for resale, rather than for fan purposes).

Physiognomy is not light reading, but it's worthwhile for anyone who likes literate speculative fiction." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETYZSVVQEQPWEYCP27PYZZJCOPA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8[Amazon Customer]

"I cited Mr. Ford last week in a debate we were having on the finest examples of contemporary literature in a class over at UCF. His writing is energetic, haunting, exhilirating, lyrical, and damned funny. You'll see what I mean when you encounter this line:

The fire-eater never even turned around but kept working like he was nonunion.

I dare you not to chuckle at that one. It's just one of many great lines that speak to Ford's gifts as a storyteller. His tales have a pretty fierce duality. He packages humor with dark, dark content to great effect. Those who've read his story "The Drowned Life" can expect a lot more of that here.

And Ford's writing is just getting better. While some of the tales in this collection were written many years ago, most of them are of a recent vintage. I've read all of his collections, and this one is the best so far.

Most pitchers lose their fastball over time, and sometimes that analogy has some appropriate overlap with fiction writers. I'm happy to say that, in the case of Jeffrey Ford, his heater is alive and well.

Ford's eye for detail and ability to turn a phrase are on display in his more nostalgic stories. That nostalgia, by the way, isn't of the wondrous, rosy, geez-life-is-great variety. It's the realistic, pragmatic nostalgia that accompanies the memories we've all had of struggling through a period of time, of living in crappy apartments over crowded alleys. "Every Richie There Is" is a great example of this. It's a short examination of those people in our lives that become symbols of a certain time and place. We all know a Richie--he's abrasive and strange and frail and brash; he imposes on others and, though we may not want to talk to him every day, we feel a little weird about the days in which we don't. And then, one day, he's just gone and we're left to ponder our own mortality.

"Down Atsion Road," "The Double of My Double Is Not My Double," and "86 Deathdick Road" explore some of the same human depths. Ford is at his best when he's writing about the interior and exterior conflicts that haunt us: the fear of growing old, of being usurped, of living in isolation, of being ridiculed. The beauty of these tales, though, comes from the surreal undercurrents. There's menace in the most innocent of objects and gestures, and Ford knows just how to push those buttons to ratchet up the tension.

This narrative treasury is filled with stories of all types. "The Coral Heart" is a sorrow-filled fantasy; "The Seventh Expression of the Robot General" a gear-clicking sf story with balls; "Sit the Dead" is an idiosyncratic vampire tale.

If you haven't read Ford's stories, this is a good place to start. Once you get going, you'll find gems in his other collections as well." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K91LUHBKEMGB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062122592[Daniel Powell]

“I have an awful memory for faces, but an excellent one for voices,” muses Joubert Jones, the aspiring playwright at the center of Divine Days. A kaleidoscopic whorl of characters, language, music, and Black experience, this saga follows Jones for one week in 1966 as he pursues the lore and legends of fictional Forest County, a place resembling Chicago’s South Side. Joubert is a veteran, recently returned to the city, who works for his aunt Eloise’s newspaper and pours drinks at her Night Light Lounge. He wants to write a play about Sugar-Groove, a drifter, “eternal wunderkind,” and local folk hero who seems to have passed away. Sugar-Groove’s disappearance recalls the subject of one of Joubert’s earlier writing attempts—W. A. D. Ford, a protean, diabolical preacher who led a religious sect known as “Divine Days.” Joubert takes notes as he learns about both tricksters, trying to understand their significance.

Divine Days introduces readers to a score of indelible characters: Imani, Joubert’s girlfriend, an artist and social worker searching for her lost siblings and struggling to reconcile middle-class life with her values and Black identity; Eloise, who raised Joubert and whose influence is at odds with his writerly ambitions; (Oscar) Williemain, a local barber, storyteller, and founder of the Royal Rites and Righteous Ramblings Club; and the Night Light’s many patrons. With a structure inspired by James Joyce and jazz, Leon Forrest folds references to African American literature and cinema, Shakespeare, the Bible, and classical mythology into a heady quest that embraces life in all its tumult and adventure.

This edition brings Forrest’s masterpiece back into print, incorporating hundreds of editorial changes that the author had requested (but were never made) when the book was picked up by W. W. Norton after a disastrous warehouse fire destroyed most of the inventory from the original printing of the book by Another Chicago Press. - https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Days-Novel-Leon-Forrest/dp/0810145707/[Amazon]

*****
METEOR IN THE MADHOUSE is a good sequel to Leon Forrest's famous novel of Chicago life, DIVINE DAYS. That book is a touchstone for American literature and METEOR, though sadly incomplete, follows up the story of poor Joubert Jones with great conviction and a whole lot of glee.

We are lucky that Forrest, whose work on METEOR was interrupted and finally ended by prostate cancer, kept on working pretty much right up to the grand finale, and that he had some good executors who made sure his final salvo got into print even in a mixed up, muddled up state which they have done their elevl best to untangle.

Briefly, Joubert Jones, whom we loved in the Joycean DIVINE DAYS, is undertaking a voyage of memory twenty years later, and different figures from his past come back to haunt him. Each of them comes equipped with his or her own back story, and these stories form the meat of the book. "Meat" is a good metaphor for Forrest's gritt realism, and you don't want to miss the pun in the title which is so close to "MEATIER IN THE MADHOUSE." "Forest County" became his fictional equivalent of Faulkner's famous "Yoknapatawka County" or however you say it. Some may feel that these five long stories are trivial in comparison to the Musil-sized DIVINE DAYS, but they help us udnerstand what the Master was doing in the earlier book, as well as introduce us to some striking new characters and themes. Rap makes a strong impression here. The man might have had troubles in his prostate, but he didn't let them keep him from the poetry of the living word.

The notes to the five stories have a strange quality as though the editors, John Cawelti and Merle Drown, actually thought that Forrest's characters were real people and the notes indicate the interrelationships of the characters with an eerie precision. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T3E96ZC16O3X/[Kevin Killian]

*****
Even hardcore readers will scratch their heads in wonderment at the sheer audacity of "A Melon for Ecstasy." It is like nothing else floating around out there. Sure, there are plenty of offbeat black comedy books waiting to be found, but this book takes the cake. Written in the 1970's by two Brits, John Fortune and John Wells, "A Melon for Ecstasy" deals with a very special man and his love for the wilderness. While many of us love the countryside and all of its intimate charms, it is a safe bet to say that none of us take our affinity for nature as far as Humphrey Mackevoy, the main character of the book.

You see, dear old Humphrey has a different outlook on nature than most people. Humphrey loves trees, literally. It is the type of love that involves a drill and splinters in a very private area of the human anatomy. Climbing trees is not enough for good old Hump; he lives up to his name by making nightly excursions into the neighborhood or a nearby forest and getting to know oaks, maples, elms, and assorted other classifications of the old wood on a first name basis. Of course, whenever Humphrey rises to the occasion, he must watch carefully for his neighbors. One would not want to be caught with one's pants down when the local constabulary strolls by. Humphrey's biggest problem is not his proclivity for tree lovin'; it is the fact that the people in town are noticing his little hobby because Humphrey leaves evidence of his amorous adventures.

Fortune and Wells tell the story of Humphrey entirely through newspaper clippings, letters, and other sorts of two-way communications. This clinical detachment serves to bring out a lot of the humor in the situation. We not only see Humphrey's thoughts through his diary entries, but also the reaction of neighbors and townspeople to the rapidly increasing number of tree holes. Humphrey's activities sets off a whole chain of events, bringing in the local bird watching society, a conflict between two powerful members of the community, an oversexed teenager, and Humphrey's mother (one of the oddest birds to appear in the literary canon).

Initially, the police are dumbfounded over these seemingly random appearing holes. One inspector posits the theory that it must be an orangutan drilling the holes. The local bird watching society believes a rare woodpecker is responsible (and in a way, it is). When the town clerk begins to spray the local trees to keep the woodpecker away, he touches off a war with the entire town, especially with Alderman Strangeways. In a series of escalating confrontations, Humphrey's main squeeze is chopped down and the local beverage ends up with a rather unwelcome embellishment. Humphrey ends up going on a rampage and is caught in a compromising position. His subsequent arrest, trial, and conviction round out the book. The book does have a happy ending, although it is as strange as the rest of the story.

It is a tad difficult to read any type of deep meaning into "A Melon for Ecstasy." At times, the book is so dark as to defy description. When Humphrey spends pages of his diary discussing every type of tree and his desires for them, J.G. Ballard's "Crash" swiftly comes to mind. If "Crash" attempted to reveal a future psychology, one where men and machine became united, "A Melon for Ecstasy" outlines a primitive psychology, where man and nature seek union. Then again, maybe that is just reading too much into the whole thing. It is classified as humor and there are certainly enough chuckles in the book to merit that moniker.

"A Melon for Ecstasy" is funny, although compared to heavyweight British humorists like Jerome K. Jerome, Fortune and Wells cannot compare. Rose Hopkins, the teenager with nothing but indecent thoughts on her mind, is always worth a chortle, as is the running battle between Smart and Strangeways. Especially noteworthy is the prison chaplain who attempts to reach his less educated flock by reworking the gospel narratives into a western novel (involving Sheriff Jesus and his posse) and a science fiction novel (an even more outlandish tale beginning with "Space Hostess Mary").

You need to be in the right mood for this slim book. Even if you do not pick up much of the humor, the book is still worth reading because it is so darn weird. Be sure and pass it along to friends; not only will they think the book is strange; they will look at you in a different light, and that can only be to the good. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QXCLH0X5TS2/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1853754706&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jeffrey Leach]

*****
A pious monk discovers a previously unknown island. He is half deaf and more than half blind with age. Even so, he can see that the diminutive people here are gentle, serious, and not yet Christian. He performs a mass baptism, not realizing that he has created Christian penguins.

So begins France's straight-faced satire of the church, the state, and anything else he can think of. First, the innocents must clothe their nakedness. This creates modesty for them, but also creates immodesty, lust-inducing arts of skirt and bodice, and avarice for finer clothes and baubles. Next, they develop property law, proven by disputes over farmland. They create a noble class, when one demonstrates his nobility by killing another penguin and taking his land. They create a royalty, by means of fraud and extortion. They even create their first saint, the miraculous virgin Ste. Orberosia. She seemed best known for her miraculous virginity, which she proclaimed until her dying day (and we don't argue with saints). In fact, she was able to proclaim her virginity even after dozens or hundreds of encounters that would have destroyed it in less holy a woman - miraculous indeed. Perhaps the penguins weren't born subject to Original Sin, but they're mighty quick with the imitation.

The History of Penguinia moves forward, through ages of avarice, adultery, elaboarate scams, false accusations, and all the usual goings-on of the political world. The events are painfully funny, right down to the cynical, cyclical view of modern times, locked into an historical rhythm. The views are painful only because they're so very true.

I imagine they would have been even more true for me if I knew more about the political current events of France and Europe circa 1900, when this book was being written. I also suspect some wordplay in characters' names that would have been amusing if I knew French. It is a measure of Anatole France's genuius that now, nearly a hundred years later, it's still true enough for a modern reader, and one unfamiliar with the book's original milieu. I imagine this book will reward the prepared reader even more richly.

This is satire at its finest - funny, but with an edge, and funny because it's so very true. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLNF66K4EWZDU/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0554308665[wiredweird]

*****
""The Complete McAuslan" is an omnibus collection of the short stories originally published in the collections "The General Danced at Dawn", "McAuslan in the Rough" and "The Sheik and the Dustbin". George MacDonald Fraser based these stories on his experience as a young officer in a Highland regiment just after World War II in North Africa and Scotland (he had fought as an enlisted infantryman in Burma during the war, see his memoir "Quartered Safe Out Here"). His stories beautifully blend humor, nostalgia and insight. He describes such military milestones as facing a Selection Board ("But the thing that was universally agreed was that there was no known way of ensuring success before a Selection Board. There were no standard right answers to their questions, because their methods were all supposed to be deeply psychological. The general view throughout the Army was that they weren't fit to select bus conductors, let alone officers, but that is by the way." "Monsoon Selection Board"), facing for the first time the platoon he is to command ("Silence in the Ranks") and being dispatched to hold and defend an independent outpost ("Bo Geesty").

He recounts such varied challenges to the young officer as striving to uphold the regimental honor in an interbattalion quiz competition ("Scotsmen, of course, if they feel that national prestige is in any way at stake, tend to go out of their minds, tell them there was to be a knitting bee against England and they would be on the touch-line shouting 'Purl, Wullie! See's the chain-stich, but!" "General Knowledge, Private Information"), being put in charge of a troop train from Cairo to Jerusalem ("Night Run to Palestine") and finding himself and his platoon set with fixed bayonets and fifty rounds apiece to hold a bridge while a murderous mob advances on them ("Captain Errol").

Interestingly, the title character of this collection, Private McAuslan (AKA "The Dirtest Soldier in the World", "Private Piltdown" or "The Tartan Caliban") only appears in some of the stories. He is a great example of the secondary character who barges into center stage. McAuslan is the central character in about a third of the stories and a major character in another five. In the rest he is a minor character or does not appear at all. To the author's credit, McAuslan is not a mere clown figure. The narrator regards him with a mixture of horrified fascination, exasperated affection and reluctant respect.

In the last piece in this collection ("Extraduction"), George MacDonald Fraser tells us directly why he came to write these
stories: "I had done it out of affection and pride, and to preserve memories that I loved. Not strict fact, of course, but by no means fiction, either-many true incidents and characters, as well as adaptations and shapings and amalgams and inventions and disquises, but always doing my best to keep the background detail as accurate as I could, and to be faithful to the spirit of that time and those people."

In sum, an excellent collection of fine stories told by a master story teller." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LWMPV175M3L0/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602396566[JFM Portland]

*****
"Allan Massie once persuasively argued that the idea of a Scottish Renaissance in the 1990s was myopically unfair to writers such as Spark, Jenkins and Linklater, who had produced bodies of extensive work throughout the post-war period. He might have added George Friel's 1972 novel, the quiet masterpiece Mr Alfred MA. The eponymous character is an idealistic, middle-aged bachelor, schoolteacher and failed poet in an increasingly disaffected Glasgow. He sits 'in a common pub with common customers and a common barmaid' and has 'nothing in common with them'. His chaste, but unwise, infatuation with a female pupil, and the rise of gang culture, have a prescient horror as the plot darkens towards an inevitable catastrophe, and a confrontation with the mysterious, malevolent young Tod.

What impresses most about Mr Alfred MA is the linguistic daring through which Friel dissects the tragedy. Mr Alfred's murmured Miltonic quotations rub against the patois of the streets, the crossword puzzles of his frustrated colleagues and the curiously scientific, clinical tone of the narrator. There is a clear debt to Joyce in Friel's prose; particularly in the final catalogue of mania: 'The man's got pedophobia, homichlophobia, dromophobia, xenophobia, ochlophobia, haphephobia,' and on for another 17 diagnoses: 'He's in a very bad way'.

But it is the spirit of the French naturalist writer Emile Zola that seems to brood over the book, as the values of a previous age are eroded by a malign, and specifically urban, modernity. Thirty years before the word 'ned' entered the vocabulary, Friel was already analysing the despair and seething violence of the inner city which we like to think is contemporary." - https://www.list.co.uk/article/2790-george-friel-mr-alfred-ma-1972/[Stuart Kelly]

*****
...

The pachyderm in question in Ángel Ganivet’s hugely entertaining and disquieting 1897 novel, The Conquest of the Kingdom of Maya (La conquista del reino de Maya, por el último conquistador español, Pío Cid), is a hippopotamus. More precisely, it’s a sacred hippopotamus allegedly capable of flight, and astride it rides the intrepid Spanish entrepreneur Pío Cid into the hidden heart of Africa to be welcomed as a divinity by the tribe named in the title. If the name Maya and the story (minus its pachyderm and African setting) sound familiar, it’s because Ganivet’s picaresque novel is also a lancing, Swiftian satire of Spain’s colonial enterprises, with allusions to the conquest of Mesoamerica (the ghost of Hernán Cortés even makes an appearance) as well as a broader view of colonialist exploits, given that Ganivet began the novel while assigned to the Spanish consulate in Antwerp as Belgium was conducting its genocidal conquest of the Congo. The Sanskrit meaning of “Maya” as “illusion” holds perhaps greater significance (as a student, the polylingual Ganivet wrote a thesis on Sanskrit), since the illusions of Europeans’ aspirations regarding those they colonized form the novel’s center of gravity.

Forget everything you know about dinosaurs. Not only did they not become extinct 65 million years ago, they currently make up about 5% of the "human" population. Rather than stomp all of us humans out of existence eons ago, they decided just to live in our world secretly, donning complex human guises and protecting their continued existence exceedingly carefully. You'd be amazed at just how many celebrities and power brokers are actually dinosaurs in disguise. All they want is to keep their secret, find the time and opportunity to really be themselves every now and again, and maybe get a good buzz on with basil or certain other herbs if and when the urge strikes. They live by two golden rules: never let a human learn their secret (and kill any who do) and never, ever, ever engage in interspecies relations with a human.

With Anonymous Rex, author Eric Garcia first brought this strange new world to life, garnering critical acclaim and a cult following for his efforts. He is a brilliantly wicked author, packing loads of comedy into noir-ish tales of dinosaur private investigator Vincent Rubio. Poor Vince has had a rough nine months. It all started when his partner Ernie was run over by a taxi in New York; Vince went a little nuts after that, broke a lot of rules and at least one nose during his investigation of the accident, and got himself declared dinosaur non grata in both New York and back home in Los Angeles. He is in an emotional and financial tailspin now, nursing a major basil addiction and basically trying to find a reason to keep on keeping on. With little left to his name, he finally gets a case thrown his way, an insurance job investigating a fire at a local dino club. As luck would have it, the club owner had important contacts in New York, and before you can say Velociraptor, Vince is back in the Big Apple conducting interviews for a case that may well have some relation to his old partner's death.

This thing gets pretty involved, as a simple case of possible arson soon leads Vince into a conspiracy of dinosaur-sized proportions involving human-dinosaur genetic experimentation (not to mention human-dinosaur relations of a much more personal nature). That is a serious no-no in the Dinosaur Council's notebooks. Slowly but surely, Vince starts assembling the pieces of the puzzle, but progress doesn't come without setbacks - a couple of attempts on his life, some inconvenient deaths of informants and friends, a serious lack of funds, and even a dangerous relationship with a singularly appealing human female. Danger is Vince's middle name, however, and in time he breaks out of his emotional funk, manages to stay away from basil long enough to clear his head, and relentlessly pursues a solution to a surprisingly complex mystery.

The book is written in first person, in the classic style of ye olde detective mysteries from the golden age of Dashiell Hammett and Sam Spade. And make no mistake - aside from the unique dinosaur angle and the constant showcase of sarcastic wit and genuinely funny writing, Garcia knows how to construct and tell a good mystery. Anonymous Rex is a thoroughly engaging read from start to finish. There's an edge to this story, a fair share of surprises along the way, and all sorts of social commentary you can read into things or simply ignore. If you've been yearning for something different, Vincent Rubio, P.I., is on the case, and the game's afoot. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V5GXHV9J4604/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425188884[Daniel Jolley]

*****
In Yiddish folklore a dybbuk is a malevolent spirit that enters a person who has committed an evil against him. This will serve as a definition for our purposes although it is more complicated.. The dybbuk is the ghost of Genghis Cohn, an unsuccessful comedian in pre-WW2 Warsaw, that has entered the body of Herr Schatz, the German officer who has given the command to execute Cohn and others. At the last moment Cohn, in the attempt to make a sarcastic gesture, turns his bare behind to Schatz and tells him to kiss it. This of course enrages Schatz and at the moment of his death Cohn’s ghost enters Schatz’s body. His life becomes miserable for the next twenty years, despite the fact that he undergoes de-nazification and rises to the level of head of police for his region. Think of all the Borsch Belt humor and comic situations this makes possible. Cohn puts words in Schatz’s mouth, haunts his sleep, creates inappropriate behavior in front of his staff, etc. This section of the book contain the broadest comedy and caused me several belly laughs.

Then the plot thickens. A series of forty murders take place in which the victims have their pants off and an incredible, beatific smile on their face. They are all stabbed in the back. All the characters we have met assemble in a local deep, dark forest (overtones of a traditional murder mystery). It is no longer a mere comedic novel but it becomes an allegory of humanity complete with the devil and his consort, a woman described as incredibly beautiful and cultured but insatiable. I will leave it up to you to sort out the symbolism of what she represents. Comedy flows as the dybbuk and devil exchange repartee and as the victims, also symbolic, keep coming. For some odd reason I had the impression that Romain Gary was just a popular Society novelist. Was I ever wrong! A look at his other novels shows there is plenty of good, varied, imaginative writing to be explored. But “The Dance of Genghis Cohn” is a good place to start." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICVKBGXY2YBD/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006BVZ5C&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Andrew Billek]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0969148739/[+http://www.amazon.com/dp/0969148739/+]

*****
Back in the mid-1990s on a warm July morning Peter Gault set up a bookstand on Sixth Avenue Greenwich Village New York City with a sign reading `Meet the Author' and copies aplenty of Knucklehead, his out-of-the-mind autobiographical journey. With bald head, coral shell earring, blazing blue eyes, bare arms and leather vest, Peter was quite a sight; he reminded me of the harpooner Queequeg from Moby Dick. I introduced myself, purchased Knucklehead, and asked Peter to sign my book. Although I only met Peter that once, I felt I made a connection to a kindred soul.

Knucklehead is the hilarious, hallucinogenic odyssey of a man who makes a radical mid-life switch from being a married, paunchy, boring lawyer to being a single, robust, super-charged adventurer. After leaving his wife, Anna, and after a fierce verbal attack against the counsel of an experienced sailor he calls a rather nasty name, our hero ignores the maritime storm warnings and belligerently takes his boat he names `Knucklehead' (after his own sense of self) out on Lake Ontario. We read: "The VHF radio was persistent in its repetition of the words "a small craft advisory." Eagerly, I awaited the advice that was to be given for small crafts; what ensured was a mindboggling string of seemingly contradictory info that left me thoroughly befuddled. . . . But the announcer didn't know how to issue a clear, unequivocal, impassioned directive. He didn't say, "STAY OFF THE LAKE!" He said, `southeasterly winds 35 knots." I had never quite mastered the metric system, let alone this esoteric "knots" nonsense." What happens next during the raging storm is one of the most intense experiences the former lawyer has in his life -- a section of the novel worth reading again and again.

Our hero docks `Knucklehead' and wanders the streets of New York City in a chapter aptly titled `City of Fire'. The author captures the raw energy popping off in a thousand blasts every minute as his reborn kaleidoscopic eyes take it all in. Walking down the street, he halts and reflects, "Right then a miracle happened, another confounding miracle. My reaction to witnessing the impossible . . . What I saw was a reflection of myself in the mirror of a display window - the first peek since the journey commenced. It was me but it wasn't me. My appearance had undergone a radical transformation. My hair was thicker and blonder and wilder. The laugh lines and chalky complexion were gone, replaced by a youthful ruddiness, even the bone structure of my face had altered. . . . To see that I was capable of physically reconstructing myself, that I had unwittingly reversed the aging process of ten, fifteen years, that by changing my thought patterns I was changing my physiology, was in my mind material prof of a supernatural event."

The thrills and wonders keep coming and coming as the journey continues. With an odyssey this fantastic, is it any wonder the last chapter, `The Realm Of The Unfathomable' explodes in mind-expanding visions? I'm reminded of The Magic Theatre at the end of Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf. A one point there is a snatch of dialogue: ""Language isn't reality. Language is an abstraction, an illusion. Illusion traps us in misery and fear. Words are the jailer. The verbal tape repeating in our minds - naming, labeling, opinionating - completely blinding us to Reality. That's why, as animals, without the barrier of language, we are aware of Truth . . . "" - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCP5BBCEMZWV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0969148739&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

https://www.amazon.com/dp/1775372146/[`https://www.amazon.com/dp/1775372146/`]

*****
We meet a young maiden placed in “The Land of Ick and Eck: Harlot's Encounters” by author Micah Genest. In the outset, Harlot encounters two schoolboys who chide her, then after a chance encounter with a fat friar she crawls into a cavernous hole at the base of a large tree. Her disappointment in being teased and having what appears to be a frugal and lonely life is not what pushes her on but her yearning to see fields filled with flowers of all types in bloom. What little we know of Harlot is that she fancies a blue rose entwined in her hair. Perhaps there are more flowers to be had down the tree-path where she follows the friar to untold adventures.

As the adventures unfold, there is little thread to the narrative and it best to allow the stories to pull Harlot from one scenario to the next. In the tradition of more fantastical bizarro fiction, there is little rhyme nor reason to the many creatures she meets save to delight the reader. More often than not, Harlot is not as delighted but spends much of her time voicing her confusion or displeasure. There are many parallels to Carroll's’ Alice but with a far darker tone. Many fairy tales, literary nonsense, fantasy and bizarre fiction involving young children can be understood as being created for an adult audience and “The Land of Ick and Eck: Harlot's Encounters” is placed a little higher on that bookshelf. Death, deception, disregard and double entendre thicken as the plot does which makes an already dazzling journey even more fascinating for a more sophisticated reader than middle-grade.

Of all characters the Nigwig is most fully-formed as a forest hag and though only on the scene for a short passage and a rhyme, plays well with the large cast as being the most memorable. Perhaps because the creature sits closest to our ideas of traditional European folklore that should have a place in the best fairy tales. The Nigwig rhyme is one of the best out of many poems that scatter the book. Though uneven, they held a peculiar charm in breaking up a narrative that is so kinetic already that these nursery rhymes had their work cut out for them. Some chapters are paired with classic illustrations by Swedish artist John Bauer, which capture the essence of this fairy tale as they did with “Among Gnomes and Trolls” where the illustrations first appeared.

Among books dissecting children's literature, Alice’s adventures, and stories by the Brothers Grimm, “The Land of Ick and Eck: Harlot's Encounters” is a welcome addition. There is much to ponder beyond what exactly a Butter Maiden is, what frivolity is found in this faery-ring under the moonlight, and how this world can make a crown or a delicious dessert of water droplets; and to further ponder how Harlot herself faces the darkest moments among the trolls. Dipping from a story book reading level, to Shakespearean, to an e. e. cummings style is a mental workout which takes the reader out of the story but this is four stars for imagination and adding a fresh flower on the crown of fantastical nonsense literature. - https://www.amazon.com/dp/1775372146/[Lydia Peever]

*****
The nineteenth-century French writer and publisher Léon Genonceaux (1856—?) is as much of an enigma as those two legendary enfants terribles whom he was the first to publish: Arthur Rimbaud and the Comte de Lautréamont. After he had done so, a conviction for publishing indecent literature followed, and Genonceaux fled to London, returning to Paris around 1900 and then disappearing forever around 1905, leaving behind a wild, stupefying masterpiece called The Tutu. The Tutu is one of those mythical beasts—a great lost book; a book that, if it had been published when it was written (in 1891), would have been one of the defining works of late nineteenth-century French literature. In fact it was published, but was never distributed to bookstores, and today only six copies of the original edition survive. Willfully scatological, erotic and gleefully Nietzschean in its dismemberment of fin-de-siecle morality, The Tutu is at once a sort of ultimate Decadent delirium and also a proto-modernist novel in the vein of Ulysses. Its existence was first posited in 1966 by a famous literary hoaxer, and until a handful of copies turned up some years later, in the early 1990s, it was presumed to be a fabrication. This is the first English translation. - http://www.artbook.com/9781900565639.html[artbook]

*****
The Unwelcome Guest is a paranoid narrative, transverse, moving like a wave from left to right and across in a circle as black marks on a page, with ample oscillations in its dynamic telling. What is framed in these short eighty pages is a search for meaning. Lubjec is the narrator's foil. Evil twin. Yin to his Yang. Is it stream of conscious? Yes, and intelligently constructed. It is also discursive, using diagrams, sketches, cartoonish doodles and word play to usurp the narrative and frame it in fresh context. It's no wonder Gerdes chose to include Nin and Nan in this double novella as The Unwelcome Guest lays solid groundwork for their sensational world.

Nin and Nan is a fascinating journey into a bizarro world where Bush Jr. is the supreme leader of a not so unrecognizable United States. The Ralph Bakshi-esque world Nin and Nan inhabit mirrors our own. A carnival of events take Nin and Nan from their unassuming hill where their only wish is to keep billboard advertisements from obscuring their view all the way to a consumer driven government building fashioned after the Pentagon. Gerdes brilliant writing moves the narrative along at a smart clip and the humor is a cogent reminder of post-911 America. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K1AANUDSD415/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1926617134&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Shane J.

Kingdom Swann is a delicious fantasy by one of Britain's most exuberantly imaginative novelists, a comic foray into the sub-world of Victorian and Edwardian pornography and the double standards that marked life and art. Rambunctious and bawdy, it imagines the red-hot reality behind the coy sepia nudes of ninety years ago. Kingdom Swann, Victorian master of the epic nude painting turns to photography and finds himself recording the erotic fantasies of a generation through the eye of the camera. This is a disgraceful tale of murky morals and unbridled matrons in a world of Suffragettes, flying machines, and the shadow of war.

*****
Twelve narratives, twelve narrators, twelve genres and twelve fictional worlds collide to spectacular effect in Paul Glennon's The Dodecahedron, or a Frame for Frames. The second book from the author of How Did You Sleep? takes his adventures in short fiction to strange new regions, where professional polygamists, heretical alcoholics and hallucinating arctic explorers find themselves sharing plot points, character traits and dialogue.

At turns philosophical and farcical, The Dodecahedron makes for intriguing, compelling reading. Each of the book's twelve chapters has its own style and apparent fictional autonomy, but every narrative finds itself corroborated or undermined by the next. Messages found in bottles, computer-generated dialogues and the lamentations of the world's last genie shouldn't have much in common, but their paths constantly intersect in The Dodecahedron, creating networks of allusions and contradictions. The Dodecahedron revels in the art of story making and proves once and for all that the geometry of the dodecahedron is a rich source of comic fiction. - http://www.amazon.com/Dodecahedron-Frame-Frames-Paul-Glennon/dp/0889842752/[Amazon boilerplate]

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0615787991/[Amazon]

*****
Freaksome Tales purports to be a collection of previously unpublished works by V. V. Swigferd Gloume, called in the introduction the most "uneasily regarded author of macabre fiction of the Edwardian era." By the end of the introduction, you've learned about Gloume's overbearing and Amazonian mother, his sickness that kept him often immobilized, his recurring characters, his deep hatred and loathing of every non-British race on the planet (but especially the French) and some of the critical acclaim and analysis of his work. And as you start to read his stories, you're going to start to understand how his background and biases influenced his work and affected the subject matter he wrote about. But here's the thing: Gloume doesn't exist. Everything in the book is false, a mixture of homage and parody of writers like H.P. Lovecraft, all created by author William Rosencrans. But among the many, many brilliant aspects of Freaksome Tales - and let me tell you, this is a thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable, and brilliant book - is the way that Rosencrans never winks or lets on that it's all a joke. From the footnotes to the family history, from the photos to the citations, Rosencrans has created a truly rich and fascinating character, and gone a step further by writing stories in a voice that reads as though it was lifted verbatim from Edwardian times. The resulting stories are often hilarious (particularly if you're a fan of Lovecraft), but also surprisingly effective; look, for instance, as an insane tale of reincarnation gone horribly wrong gradually becomes more and more disturbing as it develops, or how the fear of women that permeates the first tale suddenly becomes horrifyingly literal. It's hard for me to know how to classify Freaksome Tales. It's often hilariously, laugh-out-loud funny - Rosencrans has perfectly mimicked the Lovecraftian world, and in exaggerating everything to extremes, he creates a funny, gleefully odd tribute to the man and his work. But it's to his credit that the stories can often become menacing and unsettling without you expecting it, and without ever losing their comic edge. And if that's not enough, there's the astonishing prose that truly reinforces the illusion that this is a lost author. Freaksome Tales is the kind of book that I love to find - something wholly unique and utterly wonderful, and something that left me entertained, excited, and eager to pass it along to others who can have the joy of discovering so off the wall and wonderful. I can't possibly recommend this strange, weird, and hilarious book enough. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D9NRMPVTHCRW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615787991&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Josh Mauthe]

*****
"Ferdydurke" by Witold Gombrowicz has finally been properly translated into English. Not that this is an event worth mentioning in general, but the point to be made is that the world of translation offers room for all kinds of mischief and sloppiness. Who would have thought that it were perfectly acceptable for publishers to allow translation from a second, and not native tongue? Imagine, for purposes of illustration, that a work of a classic British author translated into German not directly, but from Suahili, for this was the language the book was first translated into. Would you be satisfied with a product of this type? This was the fate of Gombrowicz, his native tongue was done away with, and the Anglo-Saxon world of bibliophiles had had no other choice but to read a lemon. Perhaps this is the revenge of the Heavens on the author himself, for never was there any other Polish author who had his native country in such a low regard as he did. In his "Trans-Atlantyk", Gombrowicz dared to ridicule everything a Pole holds dear, together with the whole idea of a nation as such. Were he to live today, he would embrace the idea of convergence and the global village of consumptionism, as opposed to Europe of Nations. That was one of the main reasons for Gombrowicz's emigration to Argentina, where he spent almost all of his literary career.

"Ferdydurke" is an early novel by this author, and it's never as crass as the aforementioned "Trans-Atlantyk". In fact, it constitutes part of a literary canon in Poland to this very day, and there is no educated Pole who hasn't read or at least heard of "Ferdydurke". Scenes from this book, gestures, and neologisms entered the mass vocabulary, and once you learn some of these expressions, you cannot unlearn them, for then there is no better way to express yourself, but to use the phrases coined by Gombrowicz. Whatever issues Poles have with this author, one thing is certain: we are grateful to him for augmenting our language. Gombrowicz created an archetype of a confused man, whose karma is to move back in time, back to school, with the mentality of an adult. I will even risk a claim that this fact alone lies at the very heart of science fiction - for how might that be possible, and what would happen if such occurence took place? How would that affect the object in queestion? Perhaps my perception of this problem is a bit skewed due to my occupational hazard of a scientist, but for me, "Ferdydurke" is a laboratory novel, where with a literary set of tools we analyze both the situation, and the object, in the vein of the medieval alchemist. This novel, hardly known in the English-speaking world, will be an exhilarating reading experience for you, provided that you will trust me and pick it up. The amusing analysis of the immature world the protagonist found himself in, mixed with elements from all literary forms, from plain mystery, via comedy, to sophisticated analysis of society, makes Ferdydurke an experimental novel of potential interest for all bibliophiles and lovers of the nonstandard. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYPZ8AE3JLJ7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300181671&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*****
Yale University Press did a fine job of promoting Witold Gombrowicz with its anachronistic translation by Carolyn French and Nina Karsov of TRANS-ATLANTYK, published in 1994. The Introduction by Stanislaw Baranczak describes how Witold Gombrowicz arrived in Buenos Aires on August 21, 1939, eleven days before the Nazi invasion of Poland presented Gombrowicz with the fundamental dilemma of human existence in which he refused to take the ocean liner Boleslaw Chobry back to Europe. His new situation obviously called for some literary explanation of how his life had changed since he had been lauded in his homeland as the author of the novel FERDYDURKE. As the Introduction explains, the world had to wait until 1953 for the little book, 122 pages, that captures how events had put Gombrowicz into a situation so intense that TRANS-ATLANTYK was his `Life Line,' to incorporate by reference a great song by Harry Nilsson from a great cartoon story called `The Point.'

"Begun in 1948, it appeared only in 1953, sixteen years after FERDYDURKE. To be sure, Gombrowicz did not spend all of that time chiseling TRANS-ATLANTYK's fine points. During most of the war and postwar years he was reduced to struggling for survival, coping with extreme poverty and wasting his energies on a job as a bank clerk offered to him by a Polish banker in Buenos Aires. According to Gombrowicz, he wrote TRANS-ATLANTYK on his desk at the bank, hiding the manuscript whenever his superior entered the room." (p. xiii).

" . . . this novel, perhaps the most grotesquely fantastic ever written in Polish, is also the most personal and engaging of all Gombrowicz's works of fiction." (p. xiv).

In Poland, "TRANS-ATLANTYK appeared in 1957 and immediately became a modern classic, in spite of the modest printing of ten thousand copies." (p. xx).

On a personal level, Stanislaw Baranczak credits TRANS-ATLANTYK with helping a group of Polish literature majors prepare for their final exam on Marxist political economy in May 1967 by roaring with laughter the night before the exam at lines like, "I'm not so mad as to have any views These Days or not to have them." (p. xxi).

A Note on Pronunciation on page xxviii includes the author's name:

Witold Gombrowicz VEE-told gom-BROH-veetch

Whereupon I commented to my neighbor, and quite loudly so that he there could hear: "I don't like Butter too Buttery, Noodles too Noodly, Millet too Millety and Barley too Barley!" (p. 32).

Cursed that warp of Mankind! Cursed that swine of ours wallowing in mud! Cursed that Slough of ours! Indeed that one who Walked there, with whom I Walked, was no Bull, but a cow! (p. 36).

A Man who, being a Man, fain would not be a Man but after Men chases, and after them Flies, admires, oh, Loves, Heats for them, Lusts for them, Hungers for them, makes up to them, simpers, adulates them, him folks hereabouts give the contemptuous name "puto." Upon seeing those lips, the which although a Man's with woman's rouge bled, I could have no trace of doubt that my lot was to have happen to me a Puto. It was he and I who before all Walked, Walked as in a couple forever coupled!

*****
Let me give some advice:

If you, your spouse, and your teenage farmhand ever find yourself tending a tract of land in the country, beware of old dudes from the city. A brief stay at your farmhouse may be OK, but if those fellows start to linger, expect mischief. Expect creepy machinations. If you find that someone's been leaving strange letters under rocks, suspect the old men! If you see the old timers tiptoeing about the garden with wide eyes, lock them up! At the very least, don't let them near your farmhand or daughter. Old people are wacky and diabolical!

That's what I learned from PORNOGRAFIA, a stylistically unique novel--it jumps and repeats and skitters and pauses and races and questions, all as if we were really hearing the narrator's thoughts--about obsession, about idolizing and scandalizing youth, and about reimagining the role of matchmaker. The main characters of the novel, two older fellows from Warsaw, are entranced by the prospect of secretly setting their host's teenage daughter up with their host's teenage farmhand. The two youngsters show no obvious desire for one another, and the the girl is already engaged, yet the men are persistent. It almost seems like the plot of a Shakespearean play, except these dudes are truly messed up. They aren't acting out of familial angst or greed or even beneficence--they're simply fascinated by the thought of young bodies and minds writhing together, becoming adult. And that's where we get our title--PORNOGRAFIA in some way refers to the merriment and anxiety these two gentlemen get by watching the not-yet-couple and scheming.

Now, I appreciated the explicit psychological and thematic underpinnings to these interactions, and I found the narrator's style awkward yet interesting, but as a plot, it's not much, and it sometimes felt a bit dull. In fact, what kept me intrigued about the book, at least at first, was more a lack than anything specifically alluded to in its pages.

I'm currently reading THE ARTFUL EDIT by Susan Bell, in which she walks her readers through the relationship between F. Scott Fitzgerald and his editor Maxwell Perkins. To anyone with a hankering for learning about author-editor relationships, the Fitzgerald-Perkins connection is one of the more well-known collaborations of all time, partially because we're lucky to have inherited their letters and partially because they happen to be two greats in their fields. In any case, in the chapter I'm currently reading, Bell shows several examples of Fitzgerald omitting character details as a way of making Jay Gatsby shine more mysteriously. Bell argues (in concurrence with Fitzgerald and Perkins, I suppose) that by not sharing with us particularities about Gatsby's past and present, the novel--and Gatsby's character--becomes much more riveting.

It's possible that PORNOGRAFHIA uses a similar tactic. The novel takes place in Poland in 1943. For those of you who know your history, you know that Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and that the Final Solution was already in full swing there by 1943. And yet, with the exception of a few references to the German army or to some characters' participation in the Polish Underground or a lone mention of a town that seems to be missing Jews, there are few textual signs that these characters are up to their devious designs at ground zero of the worst genocide in modern history, that they even know what's befalling the world beyond their silly (though significant) antics. It's as if Gombrowicz wrote a novel about a known historical figure and then left that historical figure out. WOLF HALL without King Henry VIII. LAMB, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO BIFF, CHRIST'S CHILDHOOD PAL without Christ. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER without the Civil War.

And this is what kept my interest perked: looking for clues concerning the characters' insight into the Holocaust or into how their own actions might serve as symbols to the vast morality questions circling around them.

Somehow I think there's something brilliant about writing a book like this, a book that picks a setting and then steadfastly undermines or ignores everything we might think about that setting, a book that puts what we know in the shadows. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHL5RGBPV1ZBF/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802145132[the17pointscale]

*The Serialist* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Serialist-Novel-David-Gordon/dp/1439158487/[Amazon]

*****
In David Gordon's delightfully bent new crime novel "The Serialist," pulpy detective noir gets an enthusiastic shot of satiric edge. Gordon clearly loves the art of writing and the conventions of genre fiction. It is this passion that invigorates every page of his rollicking adventure and turns "The Serialist", almost, into a post-modern course in storytelling. Breaking the fourth wall immediately to speak directly to the reader, Harry Bloch (a second rate writer and a very unlikely hero) outlines how important it is to deliver the perfect first line in a novel. So it is with some amusement that we don't actually kick off the story until the end of the first chapter. And that first line is a doozy--even if technically it isn't the first line!

Bloch has achieved some literary success. Under various pseudonyms, he has penned popular fictional series containing sci-fi love slaves, Blaxploitation detectives, and romantic vampire entanglements. When a convicted serial killer reaches out to his favorite porno writer, it happens to be one of Bloch's alter egos. Given the chance of a lifetime to ghostwrite the memoirs of the notorious mass murderer, Bloch cannot resist. But it may just be a deal with the devil as new murders start to occur wherever our intrepid researcher goes. When he becomes implicated, what's left but to solve the case and prove his innocence? With an assortment of colorful allies including a stripper bent on revenge and his adolescent business partner, Bloch's detective work proves to be as hilarious as it is harrowing.

David Gordon stays true to classic detective noir while at the same time skewering it--it is a precision act. While the book loses some of its humor as it races to the appropriately convoluted conclusion, the satire is spot on and, often times, laugh out loud funny. If that weren't enough, we are also treated to various ridiculous chapters from Harry Bloch's other books to parallel the main action. It's an unconventional device that adds much depth to the argument that "The Serialist" is really a paean to writers everywhere. Boldly inventive, with heart and wit to spare, "The Serialist" is great fun and, most assuredly, recommended. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WIQHRO8GKD3/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439158487&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[K.

*****
"Publicized as "the stunning novel of the coming millennium," Stuart Gordon's novel uses the conceit of a fake biography to tell the story of Ralph M'Botu Kitaj, a "conjurer, arms dealer, visionary, con-man," and possible messiah-a man who disappears in plain view of 100,000 people on December 25, 1992, in Venice, but promises to return at the beginning of the new century.

As Big Lies go, Smile on the Void is one of the biggest: an engrossing tale supposedly penned by one of Kitaj's followers as he evades the authorities, Kitaj's religion having been banned in most countries. With wit and sincerity, the book relates the story of Kitaj's rocky path toward ultimate enlightenment. Just as any good biographer should, Gordon, through his narrator, grounds his novel in precise detail. The book convinces at a micro level even as it teases the reader with impossibilities at the macro level. Few books manage to get under the skin the way this one does and few novels of any type-fantastical or mainstream-manage to portray a character as convincingly, flaws and all.

Due, I suppose, to the "new age" marketing of the book, Smile on the Void has been lumped in with The Illuminatus Trilogy, but the novel has much more to offer than jokey conspiracy theory paranoia. Ultimately, despite disavowals and disclaimers, Gordon tells the story of a difficult and heartfelt search for individual spirituality in our sometimes soulless consumer world." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2002/cur0205.htm[Jeff VanderMeer]

*The Unstrung Harp; or, Mr. Earbrass Writes a Novel* (1953)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0151004358/[Amazon]

*****
THE UNSTRUNG HARP was Edward Gorey's first novel, published in 1953. Although full of the droll humour that makes all of his efforts true pleasures to read, it is a little different from later, typical Gorey. There is more text with each illustration, and the characters involved are not as realistic as later, although these illustrations are still pen and ink drawings set in Edwardian times.

The story concerns C. F. Earbrass, the "well-known novelist". Earbrass is at work on a new book, and each picture shows a stage. Gorey's book is a wonderful and insightful commentary on the process of literary creation, and I will quote from one page:

"The first draft of TUH is more than half finished, and for some weeks its characters have been assuming a fitful and cloudy reality. Now, a minor one named Glassglue has materialized at the head of the stairs as his creator is about to go down to dinner. Mr Earbrass was aware of the peculiarly unpleasant nubs on his greatcoat, but not the blue-tinted spectacles. Glassglue is about to mutter something in a tone too low to be caught and, stepping sideways, vanish."

If you could only see the illustration accompanying this you would get the book immediately. THE UNSTRUNG HARP is a very funny book and is worth seeking out by all Gorey fans, although THE OTHER STATUE might make a better introduction. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OIJ3UUURR04G/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151004358&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Christopher Culver]

*****
ALTHOUGH this Swiftian novel is cited in various genre checklists, it seems to have gone unread almost since its (presumably unique) publication. The book would probably remain unperused today, were it not for the curious fact that its author was that rarest of beasts, a rabbinical fabulist. While there have been many Jewish fabulists, fantasy-writing rabbis are encountered rather less frequently.

Small tidbits of information on the Web portray Rabbi Gotthelf as leading an active, unexceptional career—head of the Jewish Community Center of Duchess County; author of Spinoza and the Moreh Nebuchim—save for this one wild foray into satire (on many topics) and some predominant risque japery.

Our hero, Geoghan Willbe, a young fellow at loose ends, enrolls at the chief religious academy on the titular isle, where a civilization was created ex nihilo by seven founders on a utopian pattern. Geoghan soon learns that "the correlation between sex and religion is as close on the island…as anywhere else in the world.…" He crushes on the school's buxom secretary, Brynhilda, and almost beds his best friend's wife, stopping short only when memories of a previous bout with an STD recur to him. In general, Geoghan is a cross between Candide and Donleavy's Ginger Man.

His exploits are couched in mannered yet very readable prose (a toilet is "the sanctum of democracy"), owing as much to Cabell and Christopher Morley as to Swift.

Based on this amusing novel, Rabbi Gotthelf was more Krusty the Clown than Krusty's dad, Rabbi Krustofski. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2011/cur1107.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*Arcadio* (1981, 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Arcadio-William-Goyen-ebook/dp/B00OGFE8VC/[Amazon]

*****
Texas writer William Goyen's last novel, _Arcadio_, a first-person account of a hermaphrodite's swan song, provides readers with a challenge every bit worth the effort. If one has read other Goyen (House of Breath, stories from Had I a Hundred Mouths), then _Arcadio_ will satisfy the curiosity about how Goyen's fiction "ended." If one has never read a Goyen work, then this will surely inspire.

The novel tells the story of Arcadio, a freak by anyone's (including his own) standards; Goyen explores boundaries of sexuality, ethnicity, and language in the tale as Arcadio tells his story of existing in a world that categorizes people. It is tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on the reader's viewpoint.

Goyen displays his talents as a student of human nature and his art with capturing authentic language. Arcadio's broken English (Spanglish), stream-of-consciousness style, aids readers in entering his tormented mind.

This book is for anyone who wants a good, but compelling read.

Trivia fact: Goyen's widow is Emmy-award-winning actress Doris Roberts (of Everybody Loves Raymond fame). - http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY1LW130T9R1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGFE8VC&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

In A Cock-Eyed Comedy, Father Trennes is like Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, a spirit of the age moving through several centuries of Spain’s history. His most recent incarnation is as an Opus Dei religious leader in present-day Spain, whose conformity Goytisolo delightfully savages. A cast of real people and invented characters, including Roland Barthes, Jean Genet, and Manuel Puig, are mixed up in a literary and historical melting pot. A Cock-Eyed Comedy is a transgressive dark comedy with a significant message about religion and sexuality. - http://www.amazon.com/A-Cock-Eyed-Comedy-Juan-Goytisolo/dp/0872864502/[Amazon boilerplate]

"In "Exiled from Almost Everywhere," Juan Goytisolo's perverse mutant protagonist--the Parisian "Monster of Le Sentier"--is blown up by an extremist bomber and finds himself in the cyberspace of the Thereafter with an infinite collection of computer monitors. His curiosity piqued, he uses the screens at hand to explore the multiple ways war and terrorism are hyped in the Hereafter of his old life where he once happily cruised bathrooms and accosted children. Ricocheting from life to death and back again, meeting various colorful demagogues along the way--the imam "Alice," a pedophile Monsignor, and a Rastafarian rabbi--our "Monster" revisits seedy democracies that are a welter of shopping-cities and righteous violence voted in by an eternally duped citizenry and defended by the infamous erogenous bomb. At once fantastical and cruelly real, "Exiled from Almost Everywhere" hurtles the reader through our troubled times in a Swiftian series of grisly cartoon screenshots." - https://www.amazon.com/Exiled-Almost-Everywhere-Spanish-Literature/dp/1564786358/[Amazon]

I have a special place in my bookshelves for really ambitious and prodigious works of literature. Loose, large, baggy behemoths was the apt title chosen for works of literature of that magnitude, particularly in the Victorian era. This includes works like Nicholas Nickleby and Martin Chuzzlewit to Middlemarch, of a later epoch, to Les Miserables, a book more European when compared to the best that nineteenth century literature has to offer. Then, coming to the twentieth century, my shelves are enriched by something like an Ulysses, a Remembrance of Things Past, a Parade's End, a Glastonbury Romance, and even by The Man Without Qualities. It is of the latter generation that this current novel belongs to, and has found its pride of place in my shelf of favourite works of an unwieldy nature.

So to sum it up all, how do I review a work of such magnitude? The scope of this novel bewilders me to the extremes. Indeed I had both this and Bottom's Dream lying on my shelf for quite a while (both of them being published by Dalkey). ZT/BD had been lying in my shelves since almost a year and I had failed to make any headaway into Schmidt's neologistic style of prose. I got hold of this one at the beginning of this year and this one, being more streamlined, I decided to give it a go.

So how did I feel? What was the predominant sensation in my mind after I went through the last page? It is difficult to describe....it was as if I had come out of a maze. And what with run on sentences that goes through several pages in sequence, a heady dose of political manifesto of Spain during the Franco regime, and a cast of characters that is huge and are mostly presented in an indirect manner that is at times hard to follow, it attempts to portray a vast canvas of Barcelona during that time. It is not for nothing that this book has been termed a Catalan version of Joyce's Ulysses.

To set an example of the kind of prose that this works has got to offer here is a sample from the final section of the book:

'One might say that just as a fertilized human egg already contains the germ of everything the person is going to be, and whose development will culminate with their birth, there are, equally, moments in a man's life which, for their metaphorical strength, come to be a summary or compendium of all his conscious and unconscious perceptions, the concentration, one within another, of all implicit experience, instant and duration, a time vastly superior, in its elasticity and amplitude, to chronological time. And to secure that instant, that duration, requires a centrifugal development, successively dilating circles, spreading out like waves that grow ever larger around the spot where the stone plunged into the still water or the way that one metaphor nested within another makes a tale. The golden moment, the sensation that by means of the written word he was not only creating something autonomous, brought to life by his own hand, but that in the course of this process of objectivization through writing, he would at the same time manage to understand the world through himself and know himself through the world.'

The prose, in general, is mostly in this fashion- narrative and highly introspective at the same time.

Furthermore, to give an example of the long, run on sentences in this book, here is another section towards the end:

'METAPHOR. How to contemplate the landscape from the lighthouse, the rocks beaten by the breaking waves barely visible above the sea foam, dripping with anemones and mollusks and black urchins, overflown by the seagulls, savagely beaten, rearing up in white. And beyond the crumbled promontory, beyond the ruins blending black into the stony slopes, the bay dissolved and calm below the saline sky, and the bright jellyfish floating and drifting, carried by the clear western breeze. And the town, between the ruins of the castle and the fortress. And the port, the boats anchored in the shelter of the dock, the piers, the wooden gangways perpendicular to the wharf, and the rigging and the radar antennas and the woven texture of all the gear bordering the footbridges, curtains of nets and of brown corks and the rough rope along the gangways, and the smell from the gangways like piss and tar and fresh paint, and the muted splashing under the gangways, against the ships' hulls, against the stones of the jetty. And the town, the whitewashed walls and the vertebrae of the lizard-hued roofs; and farther on, the long dirty beach, dry seaweed, sinuously accumulated, and driftwood and branches like bones and organic flotsam and indestructible plastics and footprints leading nowhere, footprints erased by the swirling sand, undermined by the deliquescence.'

Indeed this one is only a minor example as there are sections where similar sentences run through more than 10 pages at a time. If that is your cup of time, then your time with this book will certainly be worthwhile.

The protagonist's concern is probably that of an idealistic young man of that period, sympathising with the Franco regime and ultimately joining the Communist Party; and that is indeed the turning point of this novel as the novel surges forward into the last section with the episodes of political violence of 1936, and ultimately terminates with his arrest as a political prisoner. This is only the first part of Goytisolo's great quartet- acknowledged as a modern classic and an essential text for those dealing with Spanish literature now- concerned mainly war and politics. I am eagerly waiting for the release of the second one in the series this July. Another great landmark in Spanish language translation from Dalkey Archive and the translator Brendan Riley needs to be congratulated. It finds its place in my collection of translations from Spanish from Dalkey that includes Fuentes' Terra Nostra, del Paso's Palinuro, Roa Bastos' I The Supreme, Julian Rios' Larva and Cabrera Infante's Three Trapped Tigers. - https://www.amazon.com/Antagony-Spanish-Literature-Luis-Goytisolo/dp/1628973986/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3TWI6JGYI576M[BASKAR THAKURIA]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Motion-Demon-Stefan-Grabinski/dp/1466419768/[Amazon]

*****
Grabinski's fiction straddles the divide between supernatural and psychological horror in a unique and interesting way. The best stories in The Motion Demon focus on mentally unstable individuals and their obsessions with speed, machines, space, travel, and escape. But Grabinki's imagination reaches much further dreaming up strange neuroses; his stories evoke a subtle animism, implying that forces, places, and objects possess wills of their own, and that they can bend "sensitive" individuals to their own ends. In this way, Grabinski's work parallels Lovecraft's Mythos fiction with abstract forces standing in place of otherworldly entities and aliens. I'm aware of only a few other speculative authors who use such concepts - Fritz Leiber and arguable J.G. Ballard among them - and all came along much later than Grabinski. Grabinksi is thus one of the few authors that can truly be said to be ahead of their time.

I would give The Motion Demon five stars - I believe that this volume contains some of the best Weird Horror stories ever written - but over half the stories in the book are rather conventional ghost stories. These stories are well done - Grabinski is on par with M.R. James in this vein - but the old "IT WAS A GHOST!" ending is a considerable letdown when other stories climax in much stranger territory. I would still, however, consider this book a "must have" for any fan of Weird Fiction. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VDPL7QRD59NB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1466419768&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Speakingmute]

"That Mr. Cunninghamo- Graham writes about South America is attractive because he knows the country and likes the people. His new book is the dramatic story of Antonio Conselheiro, a strange fanatical ruffian who raised an insurrection thirty years ago at Canudos, in Northern Brazil, and, after repulsing several Brazilian expedi- tions, was at last overwhelmed by large regular forces with artillery. Conselheiro and his followers had wandered about for many years, repairing the churches and denouncing the worldli- ness of the clergy, but they were anything but Puritans or Quakers in their mode of life. The combination of mysticism and licence, which is not unusual, is well explained by the author. His narrative of the successive sieges of Canudos is an admirable piece of writing. The fanatics held out to the end, even after their prophet, worn out by prolonged fasting, had died. The Brazilian troops, like their opponents, took no prisoners, and none survived the final bombardment. It may be suspected that, if Conselheiro had not professed a vague kind of Monarchism, the new Republic—as it was in 1897—might have left him alone in his remote fastness." - http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-march-1920/23/a-brazilian-mystic-by-r-b-cunninghame-graham-heine[*The Spectator*, 13 March, 1920, page 23]

[[The_Meeting_at_Telgte]]
*The Meeting at Telgte* (1990)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
Or are you well informed about the history of the "Thirty Years War" in Germany? Do the following names mean anything at all to you: Jakob Boehme? Paul Fleming? Andreas Gryphius? Martin Opitz? and especially Paul Gerhardt? And then the really essential names: Heinrich Schuetz? Johann Jacob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen? Those are just a few of the cast of historical personages that Guenter Grass assembles in his imagination in the village of Telgte in 1647, and if the names and places are utterly meaningless to you, you'll never get past the first chapter of this well-packed little book.

Still, there are reasons why you might want to try. It's a "quick read" if you have a running start, and drop-dead funny if you have any idea what the stakes are. It's also a vivid lesson in European political and religious history, a lesson that will pound the significance of the 17th Century for 20th Century Germany in your Anglophone head forevermore. And it's a pointed reprimand to the self-importance of writers and scholars of any era.

Here's the scene: Simon Dach, a professor of poetry at Koenigsberg, has invited all the most notable Protestant writers of war-torn Germany to gather and discuss the state of the German language and the vision of German intellectuals for a "new Germany" after the impending peace. The poets find themselves helplessly stranded until they are 'rescued' by the extravagant figure of Gelnhausen (Grimmelshausen), unbeknowst to them the most notorious free-booter in Germany. Gelnhausen is the pivotal character in this narrative, and his interface with the assorted literary bigwigs provides most of the humor. They regard him as a rogue and a buffoon, while he is eager to absorb what lessons he can from them. The 'punch line' is that, among all these preening, posing mediocrities, Gelnhausen will become the author of the greatest German novel of the epoch, the picaresque classic "Simplicius Simplicissimus." Quite frankly, if you've never read Simplicius, you'd be better off to start with that, and read Guenter Grass and Bertolt Brecht later. The problem, sad to say, is that Simplicius has never gotten much attention in the English world, and translations go out of print quickly. There's a simplified abridgement of the story available, titled "Adventures of a Simpleton," which I've also reviewed; it's adequate to prepare you for Telgte.

As a foil to the resourceful rascal Gelnhausen, Grass introduces the other greatest creative genius of baroque Germany - composer Heinrich Schuetz - into the Telgte 'parliament of fowls' as an uninvited guest. All the assembled 'intellectuals' are secretly uncomfortable with the austere composer, well aware that his opinion of their word-smithing is far from laudatory. Schuetz, in real history, lamented the failure of German writers to provide texts comparable to the Italian poets like Petrarch and Tasso. His own choices for texts to be set in music came chiefly from the Italians and from the German translation of the Bible. (If you are unfamiliar with Schuetz's music, this review will have supreme impact on your future life; you simply shouldn't spend another week without hearing it. Luckily for your wallet, Brilliant Classics has issued a three-box multi-CD edition of Schuetz's most sublime compositions, performed by Cappella Augustana.) Schuetz's grave presence dominates the assembly rather like that of Obi-Wan Kenobi dominated scenes in Star Wars. There is no historical probability than Schuetz and Grimmelshausen ever met, but in Grass's fantasy, Schuetz sees deep into the character of the brilliant rogue, and assigns him the task of writing rather than raiding.

Schuetz also confronts his musical mirror image, the pietist hymn-writer Paul Gerhardt, whose 'simple' strophic songs are still sung by Lutherans and Calvinists around the world. This confrontation is possibly the deepest and most ambiguous theme of the book, amounting to a question about the value of any art in the lives of ordinary people. You'll have to take The Meeting of Telgte on for yourself in order to learn what Grass concludes.

If indeed you decide to read this spectacular parable, here's what you need to do: read the "Afterword" by Leonard Forster first. Then, as you start the book, for the first three or four chapters, keep your finger in the "Dramatis Personae" at the back of the book, and look up each new character as he is introduced. Then, by the time Gelnhausen takes charge, you'll be having enough fun to keep reading despite any unfamiliarity with the flock of odd birds. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H0D0KDLDOZ9D/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0156585758&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Reviewer]

Wait! No it wasn't. It was the worst of times (again!), I think. Or, the times were at least as bad as the last time. But, what's happened to time? And, what's happened to place? Most of all, what's happened to me?

We are being taken somewhere that is not like where we were, but we can't remember where we were - or when. There's that time thing again; maybe, we think, we don't need time; but we do, so we have to find a way to find some.

This book is about something, somewhen, leading somewhere with some point that Gray wanted to make. I really hope he made it. It isn't important whether I recognized it as it went by. I was trying to figure out how I could avoid being what, when and where this was.

The main character is named Lanark and/or Thaw. He, or one of him, is dead. Or, the one who was that is now dead is also the one who is now alive or this second one is the dead first one somewhere else. Whatever he is, he isn't very likable. This puts him in good company with every other unlikable person. We are told about him(s) and the others by the author or the author's author.

Is a metafiction created by the author as author the same as a metafiction created by the author about another author? Is it still a metafiction or is it only the author sticking himself into the one fiction? Does the answer to either of those questions make a bit of difference? And, was there any reason for the last question, before this, or was it presumed to be asked before it, or this second question before this question mark and after the previous?

Confused (there should be a question mark next, but I don't want this to be confused as being a part of the previous questions, so I'll consider 'Confused' (the first) to be a statement of fact rather than an interrogatory).

It is worth the price of the book to read the Epilogue (which isn't one). By the by, Part 1 is not first, either; though, given everything else going on, no one should expect it to be. And, part of the time is spent in hell. All for one inclusive price and set of pages - that include Gray's art work.

To put it succinctly, if you need a book to start at A and go to Z and say The End - run from this one. If you need a book to actually make sense in such a way that you know what's going on or has gone on - join the race to the door. If you need likable characters or characters that make sense - recite the Who's on First? routine as you put this book down (un-bought).

If anyone is left, this is not an easy book to read or like - but it is a lot of fun. That's why I spend so much time reading. I've ordered three more by Gray. Consider that statement as a recommendation for this one. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CGW09VZAC6G8/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841959073[Tanstaafl]

[[Poor_Things]]
*Poor Things: Episodes from the Early Life of Archibald McCandless M.D. Scottish Public Health Officer* (1993)

http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Things-Episodes-Archibald-McCandless/dp/0151730768/[Amazon]

*****
'Poor Things' is the perfect example of how Gray understands the power of the medium he works in. Just as two poets could destroy the Eastern Empire in 'Unlikely Stories, Mostly', Gray playfully toys with the reader's perception of reality and truth and how it is influenced by the media. Rather than being the author of Poor Things, Gray purports to be merely an editor, who has discovered a manuscript and letter, which he presents for the reader's examination. His personae in this instance implies that the novel has been 'received' rather than 'created'. This lends the rather bizarre proceedings a strange air of credibility, and stops the reader pondering over the likelihood of some of the more extraordinary events occurring. For example, Baxter's "skeely, skeely fingers" performing the "skilfully manipulated resurrection" of a young woman is the stuff of fairy tales, but due to Gray's web of fibs, it is understood as a rational medical discovery rather than a magical act. The main body of the book is presented as a first-person narrative, written by one Archibald McCandless. In it, he describes how an eccentric friend creates a woman from a dead body, in the manner of Baron Frankenstein. However, a letter accompanying the narrative (according to Gray) states that it is little more than a pack of lies. The letter has been written by the very woman who the narrative covered. On top of this confusion, Gray has annotated and analysed the text, and professes to believe the original narrative as true. In this fashion, the novel is as 'stitched together' as Bella herself, every 'fact' seems to be contradicted later, true history is marred by pure fiction, almost making it impossible to separate truth from falsehood. From the very beginning of the novel, the reader is confronted by colliding facts, and must make a choice as to who he or she believes: Archibald or Victoria. Because the choice has to be made between the two characters, Gray's own 'facts' are never brought into doubt. Even the erratum slip in the endpapers adds unnecessary confusion to the proceedings, stating: "The etching on page 187 does not portray Professor Jean Martin Charcot, but Count Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac." Apart from the fact that the accuracy of this one etching has little if no effect on the reader's perception of the novel, Gray has once again abused the power that has been vested in him by creating unnecessary confusion. If Gray himself was responsible for the illustrations, would he choose to draw the wrong character deliberately, or would he draw the correct one but deliberately try to mislead the readers with an erratum slip? Alternatively, is the etching of someone completely different (i.e. neither Charcot or Count Robert)? Whatever the identity of the etched man, to mislead the reader in this way would be entirely pointless. Therefore, the only rational answer is that the illustrations were done by William Strang and Gray is indeed only the editor. In this fashion, Gray leads the reader to ridiculous conclusions throughout the novel. Another example of this trickery can be found in the medical terminology used within the novel. When describing Bella being shot in the foot by Blessington, McCandless states that the bullet had punctured "the integument between the ulna and radius of the second and third metacarpals". However, Bella, in her letter, describes this terminology as "blethers, havers, claptrap, gibberish, gobbledegook" and then describes the actual wound as "puncturing the tendon of the oblique head of adductor hallucis between the great and index proximal phalanges without chipping a bone". Unless the reader is aware of medical terms for various parts of the foot, neither sentence makes more sense than the other. Gray is fully aware of the power of the written word, as if he had not brought the statement into question, the great majority of his readers would have accepted it as a sound medical analysis. However, as he takes on the persona of the editor, he has put himself into a position to make the reader aware of this power. In a similar way to the etching, the accuracy of the medical description has no bearing on the novel, but is Gray's way of making the point that what is written cannot be assumed to be fact. Although this may seem rather obvious, if I personally looked back over the multitude of books that I have read, there must have been countless occasions of me blindly accepting a similar statement without a second thought. In this way, Gray has used his persona as editor to provoke thought and contemplation in the reader over the book that they have just read. What better way could Gray have found for his piece of writing to have a lasting effect on its reader? Once again, Gray has hidden the key to the entire novel in the epilogue, on this occasion on pages 274-5 of Victoria's letter. The sentence reads: "If you ignore what contradicts common sense and this letter you will find that this book records some actual events during a dismal era... it is as sham-gothic as the Scott Monument". Gray fully realises that his novel is fantastical and the period in which it is set is outwith his own experience. However, Poor Things is the kind of novel which, when read for a second time, offers the reader a whole new perspective on the goings-on and Gray is actively encouraging his readership to do this. By printing the book in a certain order, each section offers a new perspective on the previous ones, encouraging re-reading. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FFLUH2MTSWY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151730768&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Reader]

[[A_History_Maker]]
*A History Maker* (1996)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/History-Maker-Alasdair-Gray/dp/015100207X/[Amazon]

*****
How can I review a book that's essentially indescribable? For one thing, A HISTORY MAKER isn't really a novel but a Stapledonian future-history in miniature, although it's too short and succinct to fit comfortably into that rambling genre. Perhaps the closest to Gray in style, wit, and profoundly enraged (civilized) humanism is my favorite Italian, Umberto Eco -- but A HISTORY MAKER remains apart from BAUDOLINO or any other surreal, fantasy or science fiction novel I've ever read. I've devoured about 3 or 4 such books each week for the past fifty-five years, so I'm a fair judge.
If A HISTORY MAKER isn't a novel, nor a full-blown future history, what is it? It certainly is not, as the London DAILY TELEGRAPH blurb has it, "Sir Walter Scott meets Rollerball." I bought the book a few years ago because a friend recommended it, but when I got it home I did a double-take at that awful blurb, which I dare say was meant as a come-on. It turned me off so I put A HISTORY MAKER up on a high shelf till this week. I'll grant the strong possibility of Borderer Walter Scott's influence, but comparing this book to "Rollerball" is hyter-styte, as Wat Dryhope might say. So's the literary review labeling the language in this book "futuristic," when it's nocht but auld lang syne Scots Lowland tongue.

"Rollerball" as I recall pandered to the superficially grown-up but socially preadolescent male who can't deal with his own testosterone but lacks the vigor to bash everything in sight -- and therefore does so vicariously. A HISTORY MAKER starts out misleading the reader into thinking that it might just be another one of those silly "heroic" war stories. But strobblin' Wat makes an unusual and highly imperfect hero -- confused, dour, educated, ambivalent, attractive to women, hating bloodshed but a braw warrior, a natural leader. I see him as Gray's future incarnation of Robert Bruce, who was no pulp fiction cowboy hero, but one of history's genuinely great men. Bruce, too, embodied the same characteristics; they even share a preference for ponies instead of gigantic warhorses.

Once we realize that Wat lives, as Walt Whitman wrote, "in and out of the game, watching and wondering at it," Gray has begun the process of standing the whole genre of male violence and hero worship on its doitered heid, and he keeps on till any sane person would be embarrassed ever again to take The Alamo, The Somme, Rambo or Iraq seriously. At the same time the author understands that male boredom and feelings of inadequacy are at the root of it all, and he sympathizes, as should we all. None the less, the older women, not the men, are the saviors of civilization in this book.

I can't really describe A HISTORY MAKER. I can only revel in Gray's use of language, the punning names, the snatches of folklore and off-color doggerel, the tweaking of asinine Thatcherism/Toryism and love of liberty, and -- in the finest sci-fi tradition -- the casual way in which his Scotland of the 23rd Century is introduced to us. The story ends like a Mozart symphony, exactly when it should. As would occur in a genuine historical document, background, a glossary of Scots words, and what-happened-next get explained in five "historical" chapters after the story's end, plus a postscript. We could compare these post-chapters to Tolkein's in THE RETURN OF THE KING, but Gray's are as hysterical as they are historical -- parodies. After such a wrap-up there can be no sequel, so enjoy A HISTORY MAKER while it lasts. It's a brief book but nigh-hand perfect. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWJSS62QLIAD/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=015100207X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jenny Hanniver]

[[The_Book_of_Prefaces]]
*The Book of Prefaces* (2000)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Book-Prefaces-Alasdair-Gray/dp/1582340374/[Amazon]

*****
For many years in catalogues of forthcoming publications Alsadair Gray's Anthology of Prefaces has been referred to. Some suspected a Gray type joke as the book failed to appear year on year. Was it a post modern joke? Gray after all was the man that had an erratum slip inserted in an earlier book reading "This erratum slip was inserted by mistake." The apparent joke was taken too far when one catalogue of second hand books published almost a decade ago suggested that the book had not appreciated in value and was worth roughly £20 second hand. This was not a bad sum for a non-existent text. Snippets of text appeared occasionally, and while the book remained unpublished it became apparent that Gray was beginnning to make serious progress on the work. It then became known that others were assisting Gray in his task of glossing the prefaces including crucially important Scottish writers such as Jim Kelman, Tom Leonard, Janice Galloway, and Alison Kennedy.

So now the book has arrived. The title has changed (now The Book of Prefaces, rather than an anthology). The price rather more than the suggested second hand value.

And it is well worth the wait. This will stand as a monument to Gray's achievements as an artist (of words and of pictures). His remit has been to produce a history of literature in English from the sixth century to the present day.

This is a book to revel in. Among prefaces to novels and poems (from the well known, such as Mary Shelley's genesis of Frankenstein to the less well known such as Trahern's poetry) there are prefaces (and prologues) to works of philosophy (e.g. Bentham and Franklin) and law (the introduction to Stair's Institutions, a crucially important work in the survival of Scots law as an independent legal system).

The book is beautifully illustrated, wonderfully designed, and contains a charming introduction by Gray detailing reasons for prefaces and for enjoying reading them (my favourite, enjoying watching authors in a huff).

This book will be an invaluable companion through life, and careful reading will have the desired effect of making an individual appear better read and more erudite than they really are.

Buy and enjoy this wonderful book. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZUH43EH3TQK4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582340374&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/1982-Janine-Canongate-Classics-Alasdair/dp/1841953466/[Amazon]

*****
1982 Janine is set in the consciousness of a middle-aged inspector of security systems, holed up in a small Scottish hotel with a bottle of whisky, trying to have sexual fantasies. So far, so unpromising. The trouble is, his memories of his (far from satisfying) life keep getting in the way. And so the book continues, with Jock's baroque and teeth-gratingly embarrassing fantasies (big-breasted women in leather skirts, behaving badly) displaced more and more frequently by the shabby and unflattering truth - Jock is aware that he is a small, not very brave man who has spent his life making bad decision after bad decision. Eventually he swallows a bottle of sleeping pills. And that's not even the third last chapter, so I'm not spoiling anything for you. This is a brilliant novel - Gray's style is (as ever) classical, measured and almost pedantically correct, but it fits Jock as well as the three-piece suits he's worn since his college days. There are some barkingly insane typographical maneuvres in the wake of the pill-swallowing episode, but that's all just to set up what comes next. The comedy is grim and the sadness is awful, but there's real catharsis there for those who can appreciate it. My favourite of Gray's novels - leaner and tougher (if not as wild and ambitious) than Lanark, and less whimsical than much of his later work. The paperback edition is completed with his now-characteristic inclusion of snippets from the book's worst reviews. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCA86D0PPRXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841953466&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

[[Old_Men_in_Love]]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Old-Men-Love-Tunnocks-Posthumous/dp/1931520690/[Amazon]

*****
How many tens of thousands of us want to have written a book? Notice I did not say anything about going through all the work necessary to actually write one. John Tunnock, our stereotypical never married, ex-teacher, ex-schoolmaster hero, has made a post-retirement second career of not getting that often promised book written. But, he is working on it.

Ancient Greece seems to be the desired starting point of the unwritten book, with Socrates our main character. Since we meet Socrates late in his life, we know from our own school days that this portion of the book isn't going to last for too many pages.

Tunnock's story makes a stop in 15th century Italy to visit Brother Filippo before deeply immersing us in the story of Henry James Prince and his Agapemonites in 19th century England. We are led to believe the Prince part is a different story. We do get back to Socrates before it's too late.

Interspersed with the attempts to have written a book we are treated to the story of The Life of John Tunnock. While he was pretty much a jerk, as a jerk with money he was pretty well liked (even if he never seems to finish that book).

Compared with Gray's Lanark, it's doubtful this book will be a conversation piece at the cocktail party. I can imagine many claiming to have read Lanark but few bothering to mention Old Men in Love. To those, like me, who like to read those books that are difficult to classify (much less review), this will be enjoyable. Those who don't like to wander too far afield from books with beginnings, middles and ends, should avoid this one.

I do wonder - if a book is about the writing of a book by someone with no writing skills, is it still meta-fiction? Or is it meta-folly? Perhaps Old Men in Love qualifies as both. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RD81BXFPPQ5WK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931520690&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Tanstaafl]

*Murder in Millennium VI* (1951)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Murder-Millennium-VI-Curme-Gray/dp/B000XGF2NG/[Amazon]

*****
I first read Damon Knight's In Search of Wonder (1956) as a teenager in the late sixties. In the chapter titled "New Stars," Knight spent a few thousand elegantly witty words dealing with a book that even Knight, master critic, found baffling. As described by Knight, Murder in Millennium VI, by Curme Gray (1910-1980), was that rarest of SF creations: a book set in the far future amidst a very bizarre culture, narrated by an inhabitant of that period in terms easy for only a fellow native to understand. In other words, utter futuristic strangeness unleavened by infodumps.

Knight's stimulating essay still offers the best synopsis and analysis of Murder's convoluted plot, which involves the death of the governing global Matriarch, and the machinations among the four members of the Mitchel family (narrator Victor, his sister Hilda, and their parents Wilmot and Alec) to replace her and find her killer before their society crashes. But Victor Mitchel had more luck solving his mystery than I did finding a copy of this book. The author was faceless. The single edition of this 1951 novel was issued by Shasta Press (1948-1957) in a minuscule run. Fascinated, I searched diligently for this rarity for three decades, finding a copy only this year. Would the novel's legendary brilliance stand, in the light of forty subsequent years of advanced SF experimentation?

Happily, perused even in the bright light of postmodern SF,Murder remains unique. As Knight put it, "For sheer audacity and stubbornness, Curme Gray's performance is breathtaking." Wonderful aspects Knight omitted to mention include Gray's keen Orwellian riffs, the pathos of the love story, and insights into a cybernetic society.

Although such a lost book, mostly unread, can hardly be called an influence, it's tempting to try to place Murder in a line of development. Had Gray learned from Cordwainer's Smith "Scanners Live in Vain" (1950) or from A. Merritt? Did David Bunch or Felix Gotschalk or the Brian Aldiss of Report on Probability A (1968) ever sympathetically channel Gray? Such Borgesian speculations only begin to assign this highly reprintable book its true esthetic weight. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/1999/cur9901.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

[[Squire_Haggards_Journal]]
*Squire Haggard's Journal* (1975)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1853753998/[Amazon]

*****
This little journal is fine and funny little parody of the eighteenth-century journals of Boswell, and Pepys (earlier) - and many less famous English diarists and chroniclers. It is introduced by its creator, Michael Green. In one elegant paragraph he tell us a lot about the diaries he used: "What struck me was their fascination with food (dinner was usually described in great detail and many of the dishes were rather strange by modern standards). Death and illness were also subject to close scrutiny. There seemed a compulsion to record sexual adventures in high-flown language which contrasted with the sordid realities [...] And there was an obsession with small sums of money." Green's protagonist, Amos Haggard (soon to be joined by his son) stays within these parameters as he takes the reader on a tour of his world (London, and then a comic tour of Europe). His diary entries are in turns droll, hysterically funny, gently repulsive (mostly the menu items), bawdy, and shot through with very funny political commentary on the hypocrisy (and criminality, sometimes) of the upper classes.

The journal begins on September 16, 1777 with a deadpan report of a man, Jas. Soaper, having been hung for stealing a nail. By the next day, we learn that "Jas. Soaper found to be innocent." Amos Haggard is a man who knows his own mind; if not closed, it is narrow. "I make it an infallible rule while travellg. abroad to see as little of the scenery as possible; thus the mind is not unsettled and disturbed by the wild excesses of Nature and barren deserts such as the Scottish Highlands." But he does travel; he goes to France, landing on "the loathsome land of Toads and Pederasts" and then to Paris, where for sport he insults the French, and finds that is impressed by the Bastille. He admires the variety of punishments there, is impressed by the prison's architecture, and makes a quick sketch - "with a view to erctg. a smaller copy in England."

Squire Haggard knows that December 25th is "the most sacred feast in the Christian Calendar," and observes annually by setting out early in the morning to evict his tenants who are in arrears. The day proceeds. He reports on his misdeeds and lack of nominal ethics with an insouciance that is constantly ridiculously funny.

There is a slyly woven plot that offers ample satirical commentary on the historic English preoccupations of class and money. There are imagined and real insults, bad food and dyspepsia, gossip and civil intrigue, poisonings, outrageous behavior, and (in a wholly successful parody of Plague diaries) the ever-present Death. In addition there is romance, bawdy fun, much too much drinking and, at evening's end - Squire Haggard's inevitable reluctance to settle the bill.

I laughed my way through this very entertaining little book. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDBGIQRKZG6P/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1853753998&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Eileen G.]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Spook-Who-Sat-Door/dp/1930097271/[Amazon]

*****
From the 1930's through the end of the Cold War, there was a question occasionally pondered in Washington; could the Soviets recruit angry, dissatisfied Blacks as a "fifth column?" After the Vietnam War, it must've been clear that this could never happen; there were now thousands of Black men trained in warfare, and guns were widely available. If the Soviets hadn't recruited an army of Black terrorists by 1975, chances were they never would.

The Spook Who Sat By The Door is essentially a dystopaian novel under just that kind of premise, but this time it's internal; what would happen if the CIA trained a Black man as a secret agent, and he used what he'd learned to destroy them? Dan Freeman is recruited into the CIA, not on the basis of talent, but because it's election time. A patronizing pseudo-liberal senator needs a gimmick to get Black votes, and what could be better than integration of the CIA? He's certain he'll gain the support of the NAACP and the CORE with a big splash in the papers, "Senator Stanley McLiberal demands Black trainee for CIA." And get them in they do, but only Freeman passes the course. It turns out he's extremely qualified for the job; college grad, army officer, combat veteran, martial artist, etc. He refuses to associate with his laid-back Southern classmates, none of whom last the month. He trains hard, practicing his marksmanship on his own time, going out of his way to be the best at everything there is to know in the CIA; weapons, ordnance, communications, propaganda. Then of course he goes back to Chicago, recruits street gangs for a terrorist organization, and all hell breaks loose.

I'm told this novel caused a big stir in the 70's, but today it appears forgotten. It's not included in any collections of African American literature, and the only copy I could find was almost 20 years old. Sam Greenlee had been in the US foreign service, but unlike the character in the book, he got sent overseas and was in Baghdad during the 1958 revolution. Perhaps the book might seem dated to some, with no mention of computers or cell phones. There's also a generational gap in the music styles; Freeman listens to John Coltrain and Miles Davis, while today's young people would be into hip-hop and R&B. The late 1960's "summers of rage," where America's cities burned, is not as familiar to young people today.

There are some funny aspects to this book. The street gangs play all kind of pranks on the police and the National Guard; they rob an armory, kidnap a General, play cat-and-mouse with the National Guardsmen, broadcast calls to arms from a cassette player mounted on the El, and when the Guardsmen try to take it down, they find too late that it's booby-trapped. First the police can't handle it, then the National Guard comes in, and the National Guard are all weekend servicemen whose "stand and fight" training is useless in an urban setting. The General, despite his bravado, is unqualified for a combat role, and finds that his regiment are really just trained to march in parades. It reminded me of the book "First Blood" where a battle-hardened Green Beret wipes out these weekend warriors. The scene where the kidnapped General is found babbling reminds us of a scene from Ralph Bakshi's "Coonskin."

It's time this book were brought back to light. It's a great parable on what the USA was at the time; a racially charged environment full of angry young people and adults who hated them. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UGELYVKBEPZP/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1930097271[B.

I’ve only dipped in and out of this magnificent volume, but I already know that Richard Griffin is my all-time favorite poet. His work ranges from disturbing and violent (The Delaware Bride) to darkly funny (Ode of the Leper) to delightful, almost decadent flights of fancy (Fiddler’s Green) to the fantastical (The Lobster’s Gizzard) to commentary on human evils (The Week’s Wash). Sort of like Edward Gorey. In the words of “Garrett Scott, Bookseller,” this is “atrocious but compelling poetry”. Despite Griffin’s (immense) obscurity, it appears that he has a cult following, although his fans are few and far between. The poet himself is a mystery. Thankfully, there are photos of him throughout his books, one of him sitting with large bugs crawling on him. There’s also a “Short Account of the Author” by Guy Barnabas Bone, one of Griffin’s aliases, suggesting it was written by himself. - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20274719-bug-house-poetry[Goodreads]

Pleasure. Humility. Incest. Small furry dogs. All of this and more in the once in a lifetime publication from the late Mr. Grubb. Davis, as I am sure he would prefer to be known, is second to none in this epic, mind altering, sexalicious, hedonistic, sensory freefall into the world of Sweely Leech. The world is plenty organized in Sweely's world, truly, truly organized. Too organized, in fact. The surly, reptilian, quagmire that is New York satellites itself to the feral green wilderness that Sweely calls home. Thickets of rose petals, lavendar and comfrey litter the garden of the Gallimaufry, beds are alive with the sharing of ten bodies worth of love, mysterious heirloom clocks time travel, and little people relatives abound in this sumptuous story of Love with a capital L. Sweely celebrates the way of the world, and the evils of complicated living. Equally embracing badness with goodness makes him a very dangerous fellow. TRUCAD is forced to ask itself,what happens if everyone figures out how to be self directed, and fully understand God? How can the behavior of the government be explained then? Machines for heads, hearts and minds make for an unhappy alliance of bad boys looking to do Sweely in. He ascends beyond the mechanism of government known as TRUCAD, openly toying with the stability the modern world hallucinates. Heck, forget toying, Sweeley delivers outright blasphemous good doing! Leaving in his wake a progeny of enlightened daughters, Fifi Leech, his super star, finds herself the center of an immense and thoroughly earthshattering, teeth rattling and jawdropping escapade. Inexplicable coincidence lays itself at her feet, posing Lindy, her younger sister, as the other character in this amazing drama, and guides them all from the safe haven of home, to the writhing pit of Blake's New York. A full fledged miracle of a book, it examines everything in the known world as being connected to this amazing, potent and ridiculous dance we are doing on this spinning ball, and encourages you to remember that "dey's all debbil's beurre." I remind you that you cannot live without reading this masterpiece. Truly the most original and exciting thing I have read in my life. Well, you understand what I mean. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LBH8W95J1CDB/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0821738070[Lisa Barber]

Colin Collins only looks like a boy. His mind, however, could only be matched by the greatest thinkers in history. Using strange forces, he is creating an entirely new world from the scarred landscape of the American depression. His major findings are in the brave new world of California, and his greatest accomplishments in a place which may or may not exist. Colin launches his life-consuming inquiry with a bizarre and engaging band of friends: A pioneering pilot, Marty McCord; the lusty Madame Bovary; his passionate companion Jesus Rappaport y Casafuerte; the beautiful but very different girls Judith Oliphant and Pretty Quinlan; his confused parents; and especially with the giant Boris, his cerebral thwin who would one day share his destiny. -  http://www.amazon.com/Standing-Joy-Vintage-Avon-V2314/dp/B001K2QEA2/[Amazon boilerplate]

"A darkly humorous look at addiction and twelve-step programs, and how sometimes the cure can be worse than the affliction. Ed, as he states in the opening sentence, is a "stupid stinking drug addict and alcoholic." Desperate to rehabilitate himself, he joins Hard Drugs Anonymous to kick the habit. However, when he takes one of the first steps of the program - to eliminate temptation - a little too literally, the cure becomes a whole new problem. If you thought crackheads were funny, wait until serial murders wind up in the mix. This is a satire, not an journalistic expose, so don't expect the world that Ed lives in to resemble a gritty documentary on drug addiction and street violence. It might not be 100% realistic, but it is smart, violent, and hilarious all the way to the end." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21LJRXHX3EFHO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559703881[S.

Michael Guinzburg's sentences make me think of Nietzche's famous quote: "Only Heine and I can write a sentence in German." He is the only English white writer I have read in the past twenty years that I know is going to be classic fin-de-millenium literature one day. Imitations will eventually arrive, but will sound trite and implausible rather than brilliantly grotesque like some pre-WWII Polish carnival fleeing from death at the border.

The French are on to something in honoring him already across the seas. I wonder what else they read?

This novel is a warlock-driven surreal take on Fitzgerald's work, with a touch of Manhattan and commentary on the Nazi ideology alive and dug in deep in the mind today, making it more than satire, comedy, or just a great read (all of which it is), but actual literature of concrete depth by Generation X. It is worth writing a Master's thesis about.

Please be prepared if you have an easy stomach. I read it in one afternoon and then after three days of thinking about it realized how disgusting some of the metaphors and images were. So if you are not absorbed, get a paper bag and don't complain.

Please continue, Mr. Guinzburg.

Really nice guy, too. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQKP09RXLDI5/[S. J. Margolis]

i loved this book and i would definately reccommend this book; but not to everyone. the book is really four short stories tied together by the central character, an assassin priest who meets these extremely mixed up individuals on missions for the pope, hears thier story, and takes appropriate action. the stories are well constructed and expertly told, and the final story has an interesting twist to it. the author writes beautifully, with poetic turns of phrase and a fresh energy. he uses words expertly, not pretentiously, and i loved reading this book. HOWEVER, if you are easily offended or just prefer not to read books that include off color topics such as pederast priests, deviant sexual content, and liberal use of profanity, this book is not for you. the book is extremely vulgar, but almost in a cartoonish way. the vulgarity and profanity are more of a spice that adds flavor than the main ingrediant. if you can read past the explicit scenes and enjoy the story for the story, and appreciate the way the words themselves are used, you will enjoy every moment of this book. i consider this book true literature. i loved it, but i know this book isn't for everyone. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R31XRAXNTI6NMA/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786713232&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[gcon]

An amazingly humorous, yet strangely poignant when it's needed, collection of absurd vignettes that somehow come together Voltron-style into cohesive yet chaotic world-building, endearing yet absolutely bonkers characters, and a finale that's truly the end of everything. Forever.

It's a damn shame this omnibus has only a couple reviews (this one included) so far, after having been released at the start of this (particularly apocalyptical?) 2020. The Kindle edition sells for ten dollars; that's less than 3 bucks per Apocalypse included, people! And that's not even including the final one, it's truly an absolute steal!

Really, go buy it. It's worth it and much more, for any and all fans of a good laugh, riotous plots that weave into and out of having any damn sense at the narrators' whims, epically badass fights, unexpected heartfelt moments, presidential and royal clones, regular humans, not-so-regular cyborgs, a completely irregular psychic squirrel, gods, zombies, mad scientists, dinosaurs, mole people, aliens, and footnotes a-plenty. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K1ZGS18JI89F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl[Aquiday]

[[The_Process]]
*The Process* (1961)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Process-Brion-Gysin/dp/1585671614/[Amazon]

*****
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven, It was my hint to speak, such was the process... -Shakespeare.

This quote (partial) above is by way of Gysin's introduction to THE PROCESS---like all Gysin's works, greatly underrated, unacknowledged, and ignored, perhaps because of their metaphysical Occult ("hidden and rejected knowledge") origins periously perched as they are on the edge of an exquisitely unique literary absurdity difficult to comprehend without submitting to detailed, in-depth investigation. In other words, he deceptively appears an only half-sincere, sarcastic author writing pulp aimed at comic entertainment alone, when in fact his works (entire) upon further investigation reveal profound esoteric depths much like a Franz Kafka or Philip K. Dick. For a long while I have hoped for what will really be a first time proper evaluation of his masterful works; I can think of no author more deserving of a much-needed critical biography, and probably many will soon be produced. Of the brilliant novel THE PROCESS: The protagonist is Gysin himself, who appears in different colored skin due to the fact Brion suffered from what he called: "bad packaging!" It takes a lifetime to cross the desert and a childhood to do so at its narrowest point, explains one of the many mystical charcaters inhabiting the novel, whose names, like the lady "MAYA" ( literally sanskrit for "illusion") oftentimes reveal their signifigance. Gysin knew the sahara well, spending a good deal of his life in it, centered around expatriate Tangiers, where he owned and operated a resturant well reputed called "The 1001 Nights". The house musicians were none other than THE MASTER MUSICIANS OF JAJOUKA, whom Brion discovered in the "land of the little people" tucked far into the hills, and whom WSB called a "2000year old rock-n-roll band!" The 1001 Nights closed down directly due, Gysin feels (with firm evidence/proof) of Black Magic of a typically North African cursive.

Celebrated in THE PROCESS in a masterful narrative sequence is the yearly Ritual celebration involving the Great God Pan in the form of a man placed inside the actual skin of a recently sacraficed goat, who chases the Moroccan women about in a rite dating back to antiquity recalling the bacchanalia and Dionysian Rites and all Pagan fertility rites, still practised yearly with great festivity in Morocco.

The novel is, as WSB said of his own work, and's wholly applicable also to Gysin's ( whose influence and sway over WSB is immense, as WSB enthusiastically acknowledges)one where: "EVERY LINE IS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL FACT AND EVERY LINE IS BULLS**T!" "WRITING IS SUCCESSFUL WHEN IT MAKES THINGS HAPPEN!"---According to both Brion Gysin and William Seward Burroughs, this is the The supreme definition of "successful writing" as well as of "Magick". THE PROCESS, Brion Gysin's novel published first in 1969 was long involved in the "great work" of "writing itself"; for according to Gysin it's: A NOVEL IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING AND READING ITSELF! To a miraculous degree this cannot be properly communicated except by reading the novel yourself, which most of its readers agree they have done so several times; WSBurroughs rightly states besides being an esoteric masterpiece it is also "first-class entertainment", and like all Gysin's completely original works is absolutely hilarious! Noone, and I mean noone writes like he does, nor paints---for he was an early practitioner of surrealist techniques developed by Max Ernst, and Gysin exhibited his works with the surrealists, but was kicked out by Breton at his first exhibition, no doubt due more to his eccentric personality than to his artistic stylizations...he would go on to establish his own unique painterly style consisting of calligraphical overlain symbols resembling magical sigils and Chinese characters placed in grids reminiscent of the likewise magical origins found in the "Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin The Mage" which so influenced other Artists and Mages like Crowley and Mathers and Pessoa. And Like his painting, Gysin's literary origins likewise have their genesis and inspiration in Occultism, so permeating Gysin's life as to be essential in any contemplation aimed at an understanding of his works and life. His experiments and investigations are now legendary, especially those taken place at the Beat Hotel in Paris circa 1960 with Burroughs, Norse, Corso, sommerville, and a host of others where Gysin Established a quite scientific system for all literary history to applaude as the "Cut-Up technique", coined by WSBurroughs.

Brion Gysin will show you how THE PROCESS works, in the very process of "MAKING IT HAPPEN"! Such a magical feat before your very eyes without recourse to simply deeming such astounding miracles an "illusion" will if nothing else boggle your mind a good long while, and make you question the very fabric of the absolutely magical universe we live in. For the literary thrill-seeker as much as the mystically-minded, for the occult practitioner as for the philosophical scholar, THE PROCESS is one that is already a classic, and Gysin's works I feel are destined to outlive many other more famous works of its time; their endurance is miraculous in itself and they are essentially timeless. Aleister Crowley was correct in delineating a classic as defined by its ability to adapt and survive, and is in a sense: "a living being". THE PROCESS shows how such phenonema operate, as well as how it can also be, as everything is, Manipulated---whether to the writer's or the occultist's advantage; and regardless whether such things are called "Black Magick" or "Literature" is besides the point. Gysin often makes his point with a joke at humanity's expense, and it should be borne in mind that he is a great misanthrope; and as for his reputed misongyny goes, he truly believed women were a biological mistake---the irony is that a good many of his closest friend were women!

Brion Gysin is an enigma representative of NO race, religion, color, or creed. He truly is one of the Originals of the human species! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6ZZ3TPTGB9E/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585671614&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Anita Fix]

*****
Hard boiled action adventure sci-fi. The book follows twin trajectories of seemingly diverse protagonists with a convergent twist at the end. A mind-wiped male on a prison planet befriends a female accomplice and begins to reconstruct who he is, where he is and what he's supposed to accomplish. A methodical investigative reporter in 20th century New York City digs into the mysterious death of a man he knew in high school. The prisoner escapes capture in a harrowing adventure reminiscent of Harrison's "Stainless Steel Rat" while the reporter follows clues across the streets of New York City in a John D. MacDonald style "who-dun-it". Eventually plot twists reveal the connection between the two. Toward the end of the book the author piles on climatic twist after twist that are brilliant but overwhelming for such a short (200 page) novel. Great action, engrossing dialogue, incredible twists and cliff-hangers, easy to read, entertaining. Recommended. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SUWNSKXPM0GH[SMCA]

*****
"IN THESE days of reader unfamiliarity with the classics, how nice to find a novel that reveres literature's titans as men who could topple buildings, if not move mountains.

The Poet's Curse is the story of Phineas Vanderdecken, a zealous San Francisco millionaire who decides to pilfer the remains of William Shakespeare for enshrinement in his private museum of antiquities and curios. After he and his hand-picked crew smuggle the Bard's bones out of Stratford-on-Avon, a succession of misfortunes befalls them, all seemingly in fulfillment of the epitaph inscribed on Shakespeare's coffin: "Blessed be he who spares these stones,/And cursed be he who moves my bones." Harrying Vanderdecken all the way back to the United States, Shakespeare's curse triggers the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 (now there's a cause the seismologists never considered!).

Throughout the novel, Halidom mocks the crassness of the Americans. Vanderdecken describes himself as "a true American, ever pushing to the front, who, the more he has, the more his appetite increases." And he bombastically contrasts the respectful British unfavorably to "enlightened Americans, who are full of daring and enterprise, and proudly free from superstitious prejudices and absurd hesitations." The worst sin of the boorish Americans, however, is their irreverence (born of a dangerous ignorance). Though they covet Shakespeare's remains for their notoriety, none are familiar with a single work by the poet. One possible interpretation of Halidom's novel is that we neglect the classics at our own peril." - Stefan Dziemianowicz

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Warlock-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590171616/[Amazon]

*****
Warlock was an enormous genre-stretch for me, someone who doesn't usually go in for Westerns at all, generally sticking to horror and science fiction on the popular end of the literature scale; and with ummm... modernist and po-mo novels and poetry on the non-popular end. In fact, it was my favorite author, Thomas Pynchon, mentioning "Warlock" as an influence and college favorite in his preface to Richard Farina's "Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me," who led me to read it. That said, I have to add this is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding books I've read in a long time. In particular, I thought the plotting and pacing were superb; after finishing a section one is surprised by how many pages have gone by in description of--so it seems--such basic action, but the pages turn easily and quickly with no sense of padding. The writing itself is confident and understated, believably pitched, seemingly unmannered; and for me the dialogue had just the right balance between plain English and "dadburned" Westernisms, going lightly on the latter. The characters appear in sharp focus and maintain appropriate perspective. (Though an important subtext throughout concerns the pressures between real men and their deeds, and their images as heroes and characters of legends and fiction.) Underneath it you have the existential Western bass line a reviewer above mentions, a handful of pessimistic figures having to do with the nature of justice and human relationships, above which are rung 450+ pages of changes. The stark, hot, dusty, minimalist, claustrophobic setting almost reminds me of Beckett; and there's more than a bit of that author's permutational exhaustion at work here, as a handful of (static or only slowly evolving) characters interact like the rolls of dice from a gambler's hand.

Pynchon, in a tiny essay on the book, says that Warlock "...must face its own inescapable Horror: that what is called society, with its law and order, is as frail, as precarious, as flesh and can be snuffed out and assimilated back into the desert as easily as a corpse can." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJO0G9E1QR8F/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171616&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Friztl]

[[Hangover_Square]]
*Hangover Square: A Story of Darkest Earl's Court* (1941)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141185899[Amazon]

*****
Patrick Hamilton is a not-quite-forgotten, admired author, who specialised in getting inside the heads of those who were disaffected, on-the-margins, or even, dangerously psychopathic - he was a stage and film writer, as well as author, and responsible for the highly charged, tightly wound, thrillers of sinister psychopathology, Gaslight, and Rope

Hangover Square was one of his most iconic novels. Set primarily in London on the very edge of, and then just at the start of, the Second World War, this follows the fortunes (pretty well unstoppably downwards) of George Harvey Bone, a not quite impoverished, weak willed man with a severe drinking problem, some undiagnosed dissociative mental health problems, and a dangerous 2 year infatuation with a hard, vicious untalented actress.

Bone is an unlikely subject to capture a reader's compassionate interest, yet he does, because despite the fact that he is someone of a definite wasted life, a bit of a bumbling, naïve and pathetic character, he is nevertheless like a lost and vulnerable puppy, possessed of great sweetness of temperament, despite his irritating flaccidity of purpose

Netta, the object of his adoration, is a beautiful and completely amoral, woman, without any charm, wit, intelligence, talent or likeability. Her one asset is her extraordinary beauty, which is clearly barely even skin-deep. Whereas Bone is a marshmallow, ineffectual, likeable drunk, Netta, and her closest crony, louche, spiteful Peter, are hard, aggressive, deeply unpleasant drunks.

The trajectory of the story is George Bone's worsening mental health problems, and the hopeless infatuation with Netta, who is completely uninterested in George, in any way, except as someone to sponge money from, and exploit.

This should be an unbearably depressing book, but instead, there is a kind of gentle humour in George, a puppyish enthusiasm and a potential for excitement and joy which carries the reader along, despite the awareness of the grim background of war on the horizon, the predictable and nasty leanings towards Fascist sympathies espoused by Netta and Peter, and George's inability to free himself from the nest of vipers he can, in some ways, clearly see.

Perhaps Hamilton's ability to make us feel George from the inside, and care about him, too, comes in part from what must have been a certain self-identification in the writer, as Hamilton himself had a disastrous relationship with alcohol, child of an alcoholic father, he died in 1962 of liver cirrhosis. He was a writer who definitely identified with the underdog, the marginalised, and the powerless in society.

J.B. Priestley in his introduction to the the Penguin Classics edition of Hangover Square, describes Hamilton as one of the best `minor novelists' writing in the interwar and beyond years. And lest that seems like damning with faint praise, it is I think fair, admiring praise.

However.........I should caution anyone who gets this edition, with the Priestley introduction to AVOID reading that introduction if you have never read Hangover Square, as foolishly, in the closing paragraph of his otherwise pertinent and interesting introduction, he reveals one of the major spoilers. - http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R35HCBHCYY7RJA/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141185899[Lady Fancifull]

[[Mysteries]]
*Mysteries* *1892*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0141186186/[Amazon]

*****
"Mysteries" remains amongst the handful of pure existential novels before there was such a thing; before the very word became a contrived label. Nagel arrives in town as an eccentric outsider. He does not reveal a complete and thorough past -- partly because he guiltily enjoys the shroud of mystery people pin on him -- partly because he can not come to grips with it himself. Here is a man able to intelligently articulate (whilst drunk, mind you) on the scope of man's most pressing questions of existence, but struggles repeatedly with his own conscious and interactions with people. The genius of the novel is found in that the way one reacts to Nagel invariably reveals something about you, the reader! Do you hold the wealthy intellect in contempt for not breaking free from the situations he creates? Or do you sympathize with this man and relate to his own pattern of self destruction? The answer does not come easy. There are arguments for both disgust and pity. And out of our own curious need to finalize our opinions, to decide what we really think, we read on and on unable to prevent ourselves from being shaped by this novel . "Mysteries" contains one of the most complex character studies in literature while being completely void of pretentious airs. Nagel has a great mind, but that's exactly the problem, he can't reason out the cynicism he holds for himself. One of Hamsun's underlying themes is an illustration of how the great thinkers of the world end up so tightly wrapped with pessimism that they are unable to function in society. He dispels any sense of romanticism that we commonly hold for the struggling artists, philosophers, and eccentrics of the world.
Oh, and carefully read the lines pertaining to "The Midget." The only place you might find a greater supporting cast member is in Shakespeare's canon. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MEQK13LJU0D9/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141186186&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Daniel L.

*****
These were the very first Barry Hannah stories that I read--short, startlingly energetic bursts of comic misdirection that made me rummage round and pull on my big black boots in a species of ebulient triumph that I bet I'm not the only one out there who's ever experienced the likes of. I remember literally bouncing diagonally round my little apartment in kinks and frisks of laughter. It must have been somewhere in there roundabout the middle 1990s--a decade despite the well-publicised notoriety et cetera and ad bleeding nauseam that turned out to be for the discerning and retiring outer borough type a bit of a bleeding riot in more ways than one. My own story abbreviated and reduced gives the following: a fourteen-year stint in Astoria, Queens, beginning upon my arrival here on these shores in 1990, and lasting until I fled to the suburbs in 2004, where to this day day I mooch about on weekends doing the vacuum cleaning and pretending to garden but I still work on weekdays so nowadays with the economic climate and the outsourcing and what have you that means at least three hours total commuting time per day which turns out pleasantly enough to also mean many good books just gobbled up in no time. Astoria is a fine place to have had a hut in I must say, suited me in any case right down to my Frye boots, which I bought in the summer of 1988 in Flushing--I was here just for the summer that year, reconnoitering you might say, very bleeding hot it was I remember, that particular season. I worked in a fencing company based in Jamaica, Queens. Paradise Fence on Hillside Avenue. Six days a week too and in the 80s I used to wear these tiny little round tortoise-shell-like glasses with wire wraparound bits for the ears, belonged to some powdered old biddy from way the hell back in the Big Smoke, and everybody thought I was sort of slow and harmless on account of such alarming magnification tightly enclosed in what were really just ridiculously small plastic circles. Had me head shaved too that summer, on account of the heat, which added some to my image as some sort of loony on leave. During one sweltering domestic job in Rego Park a woman came outside and gave the crew lemonade--she found out where I was from and asked how long I'd been in New York. "Nearly three months now," I said. "You're English isn't bad for just three months," she said. "Thanks very much," I replied. "I really like it here. I think I'm going to come back someday and maybe stay a little longer." And I did. Three apartments I shacked up in between 1990 and 2004, the first lasting a little over eight months coz the utterly repulsive and money-grubbing super slash landlord there was this pasty-faced Romanian peasant who hated me from the get-go and tried to gouge me right, left and center until I snapped and told this cash-crazed tinker that he could stuff the security deposit right up his Bucharest coz I'm keeping this month's rent and oh yeah I'm moving to the next building too and you smell a lot like boiled cabbage and your wife, if indeed that is what the rump-fed ronyon is, wears combat boots, has a moustache and also smells a lot like boiled cabbage. And I did move right next door and the super in this building was a felly from Montenegro named Drasko and this dude with his little fambly were just the exact opposite of the ghastly and grasping Romanians: just honest-to-God good people. So happy indeed was I with me new digs that I painted a giant red rectangle on the wall of the bedroom and covered it perfectly with this huge gilt picture frame I'd found thrown out on the footpath and for some reason I associate this with Barry Hannah coz it was that same day I went still slightly splotched in red enamel paint to the book sale across the street in our local library. It was there in fact that I first clapped eyes on the little paperback that could, Captain Maximus. These dopey librarians, up to their unshaved eyebrows in that limitless stupidity of theirs, were selling off in a slack-jawed fundraiser this priceless comic gem for a dollar to just anyone who happened by. "Don't you even know," I asked, "who this dude is? And what this formidable book of short stories actually represents?" "Who and what would that be, dear?" said some tweedy and tiny bun-headed old biddy in huge spectacles and the posture of one still active in curling circles. Moreover, this wretched little woman bore a startling resemblance to Helen Thomas so I turned tail and bolted back to my hut lickety-split with me Maximus under me oxter. These stories cooked up a dense and all-encompassing fogbank of fanschmabulous fiction that it was absolutely a macaroon-inflected delight to get temporarily lost in. Still packs a punch all these years later coz now that the poor old Mississippian has just checked out for good I re-read Captain Maximus and the hard, clean lines are all still there, singled up and bold as bleeding brass. In Astoria all those years as I say I lived mostly on just one single street, 31st Street--no fooling, the same exact street that Rory Gallagher sings about in that song Alcohol on his Live Irish Tour. This whole double album is as live as live gets, recorded in 1974 from shows in Belfast, Dublin and Cork, with Rory repeatedly tearing up the joint, Rod D'Eath rock solid on drums--excellent name for a drummer I always thought--the great Strother Martin on keyboards sweetly swatting them electric ivories and last but not least, the ace of bass, Mister Gerry McEvoy. Otto in the Simpsons will one day when they finally get some good writers back on the show allude to some musical hairball who can play bass lines like McEvoy. There was a feature story in yesterday's Daily News about New York City in the 1990s, the crime and general berserkery they had thought they'd wiped out came back for a nostalgic little look see in this decade apparently, all the while I was there in Queens as a matter of fact. No one ever bothered me though, not one little bit and once when I went arse over teakettle after a shopping expedition in the snow at least two people rushed out to help me to my feet and one even ran after and re-captured my escaped oranges! I could see the entire New York City skyline from the rooftop of my building--I often sat up there through balmy summer nights smoking cheroots on the fire escape and re-reading good books. Much the most of Captain Maximus was re-read on or around that fire escape--sometimes I had to stand up after a particularly good sentence or paragraph and stomp round basically bagonghi with wonder and laughter. I seem to very distinctly remember doing this not infrequently. I think it was the opening story that made me stagger about helplessly the first time too, Getting Ready--what a larf Hannah is here telling of the travails of the fisherman Roger Laird. When this dude is firing on all four cylinders sparks start to fly. Read I Am Shaking to Death if you don't believe me and if you still don't believe me after you've read it then read Even Greenland and if you don't like that either well chop my got-danged suey, I doubt I can help you. I reckon to date I've read quite a lot of this Southerner's novels and stories--am halfway through a re-read of The Tennis Handsome at the minute, an odd and dementedly funny novel which I actually got to read some of while listening to Eric Clapton singing that great Cream song Anyone For Tennis? on the Wurlitzer in this juke joint I know. This comic gem from 1983 is so blame funny you won't even notice you're peeing in your pants half the time. Ray (1980) is a slap-happy little slice of cheese Danish too, don't miss that novella either on any account--whatever you might happen to hear about editor Gordon Lish's role in the publication--and the stories in Airships (1978) and High Lonesome (1996) just could not have been written by anyone other than the inimitable Mister Hannah. Even his first novel, Geronimo Rex (1972), is a rambunctious and grotesquely funny coming-of-age story. Rest in peace, dude. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3VNV65XYKKY6A/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp[Noddy Box]

*****
Nick Harkaway's "The Gone Away World," is a brilliant, funny, and inventive post-apocalyptic novel. Wielding a very sharp satirical pen, Harkaway skewers everything from the British school system, to Kung Fu movies, to super-secret military complexes, to corporate executives (he introduces a "pencilneck" rating scale from A-Z, where grade A pencilnecks are completely inhuman cogs in the machine). Not for nothing do people compare this novel to Heller's " Catch-22 ," Vonnegut's " Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novel " (although " Breakfast of Champions: A Novel " might be more apt), and Haldeman's " The Forever War ". Harkaway's humor may be biting, but it is rarely cruel, and never bitter. Indeed, there is a basic warmth and sweetness to the book that only once or twice dips into sentimentality.

In very sketchy outline, just a bit more than half of the book takes place in a near future Earth in which the fabric of reality has been shattered. Dangerous, reality-eating "Stuff" covers most of the planet, but a world-girdling pipeline has cleared the Stuff from a narrow band of land, allowing human existence to continue more or less as before. Our first-person narrator and his close friend Gonzo Lubitsch belong to an elite team of misfits who fix things when they go very wrong ... as they have in the first 25 pages of the novel. But before we can see the team work their magic, we get a 275-page-long flashback to our main characters' youth, long before the disastrous Gone Away War that tore reality to shreds. This sounds tedious, but it's actually quite good. Rah, rah, Jarndice University! So sad about Addeh Katir, a tiny country destroyed by the international banking system and occupied by troops that just happen to include our motley gang. Once war comes, things get progressively weirder and more complicated. Eventually, our first-person narrator admits to a massive story-telling cheat that drives the final third of the novel and forces a re-evaluation of the first two-thirds. (No, he's not dead, and it isn't a dream.) This will annoy some, but it didn't bother me. In any event, we soon learn that Things are seriously Screwed Up, and it will take a heroic effort to set them right. Fortunately, there are heroes on hand ... including quite a few we never suspected of heroism.

In the end, this novel is less about war, kung fu, or the fabric of reality than it is about maintaining our humanity in the face of pressures to surrender to the Machine. The great sociologist Max Weber once said, "The fate of our times is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world." Weber worried in particular about "the machine-like regulation of bureaucracy" that was a product of rationalization. Harkaway, who studied sociology at Cambridge, seems to suggest that the way to defeat bureaucracy and reconnect with humanity is through the re-enchantment of the world. He makes a good case.

Bottom line: This novel is humorous, off-beat, and original. It's also warm and thoughtful and occasionally romantic, albeit in a very guy-friendly way. I enjoyed it a great deal and recommend it highly. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29T0FLEJVYTHW/[Michael and Julie]

*****
I can only imagine the shock that readers received and still receive (according to amazon reviews) after diving into M. John Harrison’s The Centauri Device (1974) expecting a standard space opera. This is a subgenre where the anti-hero still has not found a firm place to roost… You know the rubric: Empathizing with the hero. Positivism. Saving the world. The good guys win.

I suspect the shock to the system that Stephen R. Donaldson’s leprous and bitter (and reluctant) savior Thomas Covenant in Lord Foul’s Bane (1977) and subsequent novels had on high fantasy was something akin to impact The Centauri Device‘s drug-addled, inarticulate, and passive spacer John Tuck had on space opera. To give you a taste: as Harrison’s plot spiral with vast strokes of almost grotesque satire towards the utterly nihilistic ending, Tuck doped-up on amphetamines becomes “quickly depressed—at first disturbed, then obsessed by the puzzling, fibrous consistency of the mud” (162).

While M. John Harrison himself might proclaim that “I find it deeply ironic—but absolutely predictable—that my best books are out of print while the crappiest thing I ever wrote—The Centauri Device-–tootles along under the rubric ‘masterwork,’” I found the novel a heady subversion of a lot of the tropes that we associate with space opera. It is even more ironic that The Centauri Device, “that reads like hate mail directed at space opera clichés” (Ken Macleod quoting Patrick Hudson) despite its satirical purposes was influential in revitalizing and inspiring new authors of the subgenre. The anti-space opera pastiche that eventually became passé?

Brief Plot Summary

First, the powers at play…

In M. John Harrison’s far future world the Israeli World Government (IWG), with is engaged in an endless struggle with the Union of Arab Socialist Republics (UASR) who control large swathes of the settled Galaxy. And both powers have sniffed out the discovery of a mysterious weapon, a relic from an extinct people, a relic from a past war that has the power to destroy the universe: the Centauri Device.

Earth has been irrevocably transformed by the “infamous ‘Rat Bomb’ wars of 2003-215″ (25). The remaining inhabitants UK, or rather “that 60,000 square mile complex of bunker-docks, keelyards, freight terminals, and warehouses that had once been called “Great Britain,” eek out an existence melting and selling the remains of the megaport, bathed in the type of “cultural decay peculiar to ports” (28). The power is centered around Chalice Veronica, the “intellectual pusher-king.” He lives in a massive warehouse plying his nefarious trade (drugs, prostitution, etc) in a series of giant abandoned fuel cisterns where “the longest-running part in the history of the universe was still in progress. People were born, people died there; some were said to have lived entire lives there” (33).

Various other powers operate across the settles regions of space including the mysterious Openers who inhabit the planet Stomach where the androgynous natives “distill a perfume from the wings of insects” (100). The Openers, in their central city of Intestinal Revelation, practice Openerism: an “eclectic” faith involving perverse rituals, and choirboys and organs, where transparent windows are inserted into the bodies of the faithful. Their Grand Master desires above all else to achieve “total transparency” (107)! A priest of the Openers named Dr. Grishkin, with his plastic windows that peer into the operations of his internal organs, has also heard news of the weapon.

And then there is the interstellar anarchist named Pater who resides with his son Himation out in the “interminable void” inside of a “spherical asteroid perhaps two miles in diameter at its equator” (69) filled with the massive hulks the most decadent spaceships that harken back to distant eras: New English Art Club, Driftwood of Decadence, Melancholia that Transcends All Wit, Atalanta in Calydon, etc. Even their hulls evoke the artifice of orientalist productions: “turquoise arabesques glimmered mysteriously down her [the Driftwood of Decadence] side; the smell of hot metal drifted about her like the musk of a sleeping, barbaric priestess; the light of plasma torches exploded soundlessly off her hull to fill the silo with a ceremonial aurora” (81). Pater spouts French and drifts from room to room of the vast complex musing on art and artifice and politics: “we live in a sick charade of political polarities; of death, bad art, and wasted time” (77). Pater too wants the Centauri Device, or at least, he does not want the others to have it.

And at the center of it all…

…is John Tuck, a spacer, who hauls freight, runs after Denebian whores, fights with his wife, drifts from port to port, almost perplexed or unaware of the world around him. But, he is the last descendent of the Centaurians, Tuck’s mother was a Centaurian drug addict port woman. Tuck is the only one who can activate the weapon. And everyone wants to get their hands on him! And as the battles rage, as the anarchist ships are blasted to pieces and the forces of the IWG and UASR hunt for him across space, he remains inactive, he cannot or refuses to acknowledge the implications of his position. SF’s most frustrating anti-hero.

Final Thoughts

The Centauri Device exudes a pungent charm. Gorgeous prose drifts languidly across the page and Harrison’s characters move “to the invisible rhythms of their ennui” (59), pieces in on the vast galactic tapestry where all the moves are preordained.

The character of John Truck is subversive to the extreme and bound to frustrate the average reader. He operates across a world familiar to many readers of space opera—the lushly realized sects, and decadent locals, space-battles, and pseudo-historical ramblings—but continues to act according to his immediate whims and desires.

The Centauri Device reminds me of Norman Spinrad’s superior The Iron Dream (1972). Both seek to subvert SF. Both critique SF’s treatment of ideology, and character…. Both infuriate the unsuspecting. Both are worth reading for fans of the more experimental SF (inspired by the New Wave Movement). The Centauri Device is literary, satirical, and incredibly seductive.

And for the curious, the complete list of spaceship names: Driftwood of Decadence. New English Art Club. Liverpool Medici. Gold Scab. Whistler. Seventeenth Susan. Solomon. Nasser. Strange Great Sins. Maupin. Trilby. Green Carnation. Les Fleurs du Mal. Madame Bovary. Imagination Portraits. Syringa. White Jonquil. Forsaken Garden. Let Us Go Hence. Melancholia that Transcends All Wit. My Ella Speed.

*Light* (2004)

http://www.amazon.com/Light-M-John-Harrison/dp/0553382950/[Amazon]

*****
Fair warning - in order to write a sensible review, I had to start at the end of "Light" and work my way backwards. Since the final words of the novel are "The Beginning," this seems like a legitimate approach. However, the intent of the novel does not appear to be plot conclusion so much as character discovery, so the items in this review should not spoil the experience for you.

Many millions of years ago, an advanced race sought to understand an anomaly of physics known as the Kefahuchi Tract ("a singularity without an event horizon"). Despite their advanced technology, they could not overcome the forces necessary to investigate further, so they built humans "from the proteins up" to pilot exploratory ships for them. Unfortunately, they did not survive the millions of years necessary for humans to evolve to the point necessary to understand and pilot these vessels. An entity known as "the Shrander" is the last of this race, and the remainder of the novel concerns the Shrander's manipulation of three humans to reach the point of ultimate discovery.

In a `found technology' motif similar to Harrison's "Viriconium" novels, the human race is drawn to the Tract where it discovers the Shrander's abandoned technology. The first primary character, Michael Kearney, is a physicist whose mathematical discoveries enable humans to make technological leaps necessary to travel to and discover the Tract. The second primary character, Seria Mau Genlicher, has allowed the new "K-tech" to make her one with her ship hundreds of years after Kearney's discoveries. The third primary character, Ed Chianese, has devoted his life in a self-destructive quest to "go deep" in search of adventure around the Tract. The storyline is divided amongst these three strands, and the Shrander appears in all three as the protagonists eventually discover their true purpose. The price of that discovery is high and all three lose a part of their humanity as they make their way toward the Shrander's final goal.

If you have read anything by M. John Harrison, you know what to expect - stylist prose which is far beyond the capabilities of most modern writers, vivid and mood-setting scenes, and blended physical realities which prove ultimately destructive and liberating at the same time. The three plots are well-written and compelling, but they are secondary to an underlying theme of grand discovery at great cost. Most impressively, the three plots start off as very distinct and seemingly unrelated, only to converge slowly and masterfully over the course of the book. If only all Sci-Fi were this well-conceived and written. Highly recommended. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMU7RSZBKBNQ3/[ScrawnyPunk]

[[Viriconium]]
*Viriconium* (2005)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Viriconium-M-John-Harrison/dp/0553383159/[Amazon]

*****
Viriconium sits on the ruins of an ancient civilization that nobody remembers. The society that was technologically advanced enough to create crystal airships and lethal energy weapons is dead. These Afternoon Cultures depleted the world's metal ores, leaving mounds of inscrutable rusted infrastructure with only a few odds and ends that still work. The current citizens of Viriconium are baffled by what they've dug up, but they have no idea what any of it is for.

The Pastel City, published in 1971, is the first part of M. John Harrison's science fantasy epic VIRICONIUM which, according to sources, was inspired by Jack Vance's DYING EARTH and the poetry of T.S. Eliot. Characterization and pacing are sometimes a bit weak, but the scenery in The Pastel City is grand, and I enjoyed the story. In many ways it reminded me of THE LORD OF THE RINGS -- a group of comrades (including a dwarf) travel through beautiful and desolate landscapes (across rivers and marshes, through mountain tunnels, etc.) on a quest to destroy something so they can save the world. A major difference, and what saves the book from being simply another quest fantasy, is the post-apocalyptic vision of an unknown advanced civilization which died out mysteriously, leaving samples of their devastating handiwork behind. Thus, the dwarf arms himself with an 11-foot tall mechanical skeleton and carries some sort of laser. Cromis and his friends ride into one battle on horseback, but leave in a glass blimp. Cool.

A Storm of Wings is the second part of M. John Harrison's VIRICONIUM sequence. Viriconium has been at peace for eighty years after the threat from the north was eliminated, but now there are new threats to the city. Something has detached from the moon and fallen to earth. A huge insect head has been discovered in one of the towns of the Reborn. The Reborn are starting to go mad. Also, a new rapidly growing cult is teaching that there is no objective reality. Are the strange events linked with the cult's nihilistic philosophy? And what will this do to Viriconium's peace? Tomb the dwarf and Cellur the Birdlord, whom we met in The Pastel City, set out to discover the truth.

A Storm of Wings was published in 1980 -- nine years after The Pastel City -- and M. John Harrison's writing style has evolved. In some ways it's better -- characterization is deeper and the imagery is more evocative. This world feels fragile and moribund and the reader gets the sense that, as the cult proclaims, it's hard to tell what's real and what's just a warped perception. Or perhaps Viriconium is slipping from reality into a dream. Or into a different reality altogether. The story is strange, outlandish, and blurry.

In the third part of the VIRICONIUM omnibus, The Floating Gods (aka In Viriconium), we visit the old artists' quarter of Viriconium -- a lazy decaying place where gardens bloom and the smell of black currant gin exudes from the taverns where the increasingly lackadaisical citizens used to sit and talk about art and philosophy. This part of the city used to be vibrant and innovative, but it has been deteriorating as a psychological plague has been creeping in from the high city. The artists' patrons, infected by this plague of mediocrity, have become dreamy and only want to purchase uninspired sentimental watercolor landscapes. And all they want to talk about is the debauched antics of the Barley Brothers, a couple of twins who act like buffoons but are rumored to be demi-gods.

This part is funny, witty, and brilliantly written with sharp humorous insights into disagreeable human behavior. As the plague crept closer, I could feel the beloved city of Viriconium decaying -- its fountains drying up and its gardens becoming unkempt and shabby. Like the previous book, A Storm of Wings, The Floating Gods is intensely atmospheric. This is a better book, though, because the atmosphere is balanced by humor and plot.

Viriconium Nights is the last book in M. John Harrison's VIRICONIUM epic. It's a collection of seven short stories set in and around the city of Viriconium which contain some of the characters we've met in the previous VIRICONIUM books and include many allusions to recurring events and motifs: mechanical metal birds, tarot cards, locusts, the fish mask, big lizards, the Mari Lwyd, etc. Each story stands alone but focuses on the city of Viriconium and particularly the bohemian residents of the Artists' Quarter. All of Viriconium is decaying, but this part of the city feels especially bleak, probably because it's peopled with brooding artistic types whose desperation results in freakish hedonistic behavior.

Though there are recurring characters in the VIRICONIUM works, we never get to know any of them very well. The haunting, weird, incomprehensible city is the main character. M. John Harrison has explained at his blog that he didn't want Viriconium to be "tamed" or "controlled," so he has confused and disoriented the reader by making it impossible to understand what it would be like to live in his world: "I made that world increasingly shifting and complex. You can not learn its rules. More importantly, Viriconium is never the same place twice." I think this is more successful in the last three parts of VIRICONIUM -- the first novel, The Pastel City, is almost a traditional quest fantasy.

VIRICONIUM is one of those works that I feel like I should give 5 stars just because it's original and M. John Harrison's prose is brilliant. Harrison is a master of style and his writing is superior to most of what's offered on the SFF shelves. However, the truth is that though I recognize Harrison's genius, I can't say that I enjoyed every moment of VIRICONIUM, which may be a reflection on me more than on the work itself. Spending so much time in a city that's unknowable and decaying resulted, for me, in an overwhelming feeling of disorientation and hopelessness. The characters and the plot, which feel like they are there only to support the role of the city, don't make up for this. A month from now, I probably won't remember any of the plots in Viriconium Nights. But I will remember Viriconium.

I listened to the audiobook version of VIRICONIUM which was produced by Neil Gaiman Presents and is narrated by Simon Vance who is one of the absolute best in the business. This is a high-quality production and highly recommended for anyone who wants to read one of M. John Harrison's best-loved works. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27IZXZZZH2BPU/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553383159[Kat Hooper]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Soldier_%C5%A0vejk[Wikipedia]

*****
This firsthand account of service in WWI by a gifted Bohemian intellectual, is recounted as ironic blind-drunk adventure. The intensity of passion behind this satire is barely sane. Hasek's actual experiences as a philandering drunken swindler, seditious conscript and gadfly are recounted mercilessly.

Like all great art, this book powerfully imposes a flavor of thought, a viewpoint so natural and compelling that before you know it, you can never go back. Without this book you will never understand the meaning of the word "Bohemian". Franz Kafka wrote and lived at the same time and place as Hasek, but Kafka was sincere and guilty; precisely, explicitly, imtimately doomed. Hasek was equally doomed, but rather than expressing tortured humanity, he dove into his sorry fate, becoming an ironic, shifty fool, living for the next beer or chicken leg, devouring and slathering the madness like a starved pig. The parallax between Kafka and Hasek creates a complete landscape of the time.

The adventures of good Svejk only touch on the first few years of Hasek's real "anabasis". Hasek's own life became even more ludicrous and incredible than his book. It is perhaps good Hasek died before he could revel absurdly in the likely gruesome deaths of his ridiculous, pathetic, real comrades. Hasek himself slogged and drank and conned his way through the purges and famines following the war, switching sides several times narrowly avoiding assassination and execution for treason from all sides. But, the story ends just about as it should, as our drunken raconteur passes out in mid-sentence.

The mass psychological effect of this book are greater than its explicit literary influences, but even they are considerable. "Catch-22" is an open homage to "The Good Soldier Svejk". Toole's classic "Confederacy of Dunces" could hardly exist without Svejk. In turn, Hasek's use of ironic gung-ho naivete, his immersion in a culture of relentless, systematic, bizarre cruelty, his appropriately obscene humor, his recreation of the salty dialects and usages of real personalities, owes a debt to Mark Twain. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MD8X1VI3B3AF/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140182748[W.

"Švejk" is set at the start of the First World War. It starts with the news of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne (Franz Ferdinand) in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 and ends at the eastern front in current Ukraine in the summer of 1915. Due to the author's early death the novel was never completed, despite Karel Vaněk's writing two more volumes. These are by most experts and readers deemed inferior and scarcely any translation exists.

Josef Švejk was a dog trader from Prague, then part of Austria-Hungary. He made a living by selling dogs which pedigrees he falsified, and he also likes to tell the he was dismissed from the army due to idiocy. Note that this is information he reserves for his encounters with the authorities. Otherwise had had a gentle, charming and disarming way, his mental horizon was apparently limited, his moral substance appeared to be dubious, and distinguished himself by producing endless anecdotes, some of them quite unsavoury. The stories were often his way of talking and wriggling himself out of tricky situations. He was very good at talking, always had an answer of explanation ready, and was never caught off balance. Despite him not appearing to be clever, he no doubt had a good memory and had also read a great deal. He also had a unique gift for manoeuvring himself out of difficult situations.

Everyone from academics to the man in the street has since the novel was published discussed if Švejk really was mentally constrained or if he simply played a fool. He could clearly appear stupid when it suited him, but anyone who has read the novel attentively should not be in doubt: in the epilogue to Part I Jaroslav Hašek writes that if the reader had perceived Švejk to be an idiot, the author had failed in conveying his message.

Švejk appeared eager to serve his Emperor and was sent to the front to fight the Russians. On his journey there he and the people around him got entangled in innumerable absurd situations. The author uses this as a backdrop for ridiculing the Austro-Hungarian army, the Catholic Church, the police, the judiciary and not least the Habsburg empire. But above all it is the pointlessness of the entire war that is highlighted. Moreover the book has many more sides to it than anti-authoritarian and anti-war satire. The former anarchist Jaroslav Hašek is obviously political and critical of the society he lives in, he describes this epoch in European history, has a geographical and historical perspective, gives the reader an idea of the cultural diversity in the region, and the novel is in itself a key work for anyone interesting in Czech or even Central European culture. Beside the serious main message situation comedy and slapstick is a vital part of Hašek's method. The author is at his best when he describes the absurd situations in the life of ordinary people, entangled in systems designed to keep him down or destroy him, but which he survives and uncover the stupidity of with his cunning and wit. Švejk himself was a master in the art of survival "non plus ultra". - http://honsi.org/literature/svejk/?page=1&lang=en[Jomar Hønsi]

"Reading Nathaniel Hawthorne's Notebooks is a very different experience than reading those of Henry James, Steinbeck, Thomas Mann (Diaries), Robert Musil or even those published by Reynolds Price. The self mannered awareness that the future will prize their "private" thoughts and ideas is absent. These were truly private workbooks. Hawthorne writes in full voice as someone for whom communication is vital and difficult. Open this work anywhere and read what sounds like the inner voice of someone practiced at concealing his thoughts publicly. Expansive, suggestive, and illuminating for all those who would like to know more of the deep thought and artfullness that went into his major works. Some of his working ideas for stories sound absolutely modern. One story idea develops the possibility of having two men talking and discussing their difficulties while waiting and waiting for someone who never comes. They don't know what to do, so they continue to wait and discussing the one who never comes. Sound familar? A little like "Waiting for Godot"? If you love great literature and if you love Hawthorne, then dig deep and buy this expensive but magnificent book." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SKJIBB2JSRR2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814201598[Reader]

*****
Stunning in its raw power, this novel, unlike many other Irish novels, draws its power from its simplicity, rather than from lush description or the accumulation of details. Stripping language to the bare bones here, Dermot Healy draws the reader, without embellishment, directly into the confused mind of the main character, a carpenter named Ollie Ewing.

Ollie has just returned to Sligo, almost mute with shock from unspoken, terrible events which have befallen him while in London, where he has been working as a day laborer on construction sites. The narrative shifts back and forth in time and location, revealing Ollie's paranoia through flashbacks, brief scenes, and dialogue, which sometimes seem to have no context other than their revelation of his suffering. He is clearly trying to hang on to his sanity--and is only marginally successful--as he talks to the reader in quiet, almost confessional tones. Using unadorned, simple language, he describes things he sees that are not there and voices that no one else can hear. Never wasting a word, his earnest narrative forces the reader to share his thoughts while interpreting his state of mind.

Gradually, the reader learns of Ollie's almost paralyzing experiences in London, where he lived with a friend, Marty Kilgallon, in a trailer at an old construction site. Through Marty, Ollie learns firsthand about the protection rackets and extortion on construction sites, the common use of murder as a weapon of enforcement, and the unsympathetic judicial system. When his friend disappears and does not return for six weeks, Ollie gets caught in a whirlwind of violence and learns the true meaning of hell.

By the time he returns to Sligo, he has come to believe that there is a "glass sprinkler" machine, operating at night, which sprinkles glass over the streets of London, that the flecks in people's eyes are aliens, and that his own image in a mirror is someone imitating him. Though Healy's style is often difficult to follow, as the reader tries to piece together the events that are responsible for Ollie's current state of mind, Healy's use of detail is stunning. Casually inserted, bizarre observations about common aspects of life help create Ollie's inner life and illustrate his existential helplessness. The essential unfairness life, the power of chance, and Ollie's victimization catch the reader in a whirlwind of emotions, and his plaintive voice, crying out from all this, is unforgettable. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ANYUW1AHIHT8/[Mary Whipple]

*****
The charms of Topsy can only be described by quoting a typical passage in her inimitable style. I just open a page at random from Topsy MP (NB: _italics_)

"Well my dear _meanwhile_ the Rowland was being _rather_ a burden because the _whole_ time he talked of nothing but the _internal_ organs of his unalluring car and wondering _what_ was rattling and _why_, when of course the _entire_ machine was one _tautologous_ rattle because he will keep seeing if he can get sixty out of her on a bad road..."

There. That does a much better job than I ever could of explaining exactly who Topsy is... but I'll try anyways. Briefly, she was a character that A.P. Herbert featured in a Punch column during the 1920's up until, well, I'm not exactly sure when, but she's thoroughly a Modern Girl in the flapper mode. The Topsy books are written in first person in the form of letters to Topsy's friend Trix, and they detail an endless round of dinners, dances, and society hi-jinks, all in Topsy's stream-of-consciousness style, with the sentences running together and one idea overtaking another. What I find most remarkable is that the cadences of a certain type of English speech are rendered perfectly with the use of italics.

Topsy gets inside your head! I found myself writing and speaking like her for days, and truth to tell I still lapse into Topsy speak when I'm feeling a little giddy. What she does with the English language is rather a marvel, I think. Her malapropisms fall thick and fast, yet Topsy is no fool. She's a shrewd observer of society and human foibles, and Herbert consistently employs her as a humorous commentator on contemporary times.

For the life of me I can't figure out why these books have never been reprinted. They certainly deserve to be. I found it extremely difficult to come by the three Topsy books that (so far as I can tell) contain all of Topsy's adventures. I highly recommend Topsy to fans of humorous literature, anglophiles, those with an interest in the 1920's, and oh, just about anyone with a sense of humor, really. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R19L2D9OZ5B8OJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007J6QD4&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Kay A.

Hernandez, Felisberto (1902-1964)

*****
When it comes to twentieth-century Uruguayan fiction, there are four mandatory figures: Horacio Quiroga, Juan Carlos Onetti, Mario Benedetti, and Felisberto. (It is true, by the way, that no one calls him Hernández, as Esther Allen points out in the introduction to this volume; there may be many Hernándezes, but there is only one Felisberto.) Quiroga is a master of the short story. His most famous work is _Cuentos de la selva_, which could be described as the _Jungle Book_ of the Río de la Plata region. There is definitely something of Kipling to this author, plus something of Poe, and something of Jack London. “The Decapitated Chicken,” incidentally, which I read when I was 10 years old, remains the most disturbing short story I have ever encountered. Onetti is often compared with Faulkner because he created a fictional city, Santa María, and so characters recur in his work. Look out for his collected short stories, which will appear in English later this year. Benedetti is the Boom writer, and he has two great novels to his credit (_The Truce_, and _Gracias por el fuego_); his early short fiction is also worth reading. And then, of course, there’s Felisberto, who deserves a separate paragraph.

One is tempted to compare him to Kafka. The comparison is valid but facile. As is the case with Kafka’s fiction, one could add material to a Felisberto story or delete entire passages from it; plot is not the main thing here. On the other hand, while Felisberto’s stories are definitely uncanny, they are much more subtle, more “quiet” than Kafka’s. There is also something of Proust to Felisberto, and so it is not surprising that more and more people are developing an affection for his work in the age of memoirs and autofiction. Many of the texts included in this collection attest to the creative quality of memory. To me, the wonderful thing about Felisberto is that, like Clarice Lispector, he comes across as utterly original and natural. Also like Lispector, he is introspective and intuitive. Jules Supervielle described him as possessing a “natural inclination towards depth.”

Felisberto was a master of the short story and of the novella, as this volume proves. “The Crocodile” is his most famous short story; _Lands of Memory_ and _Around the Time of Clemente Colling_, two of his best novellas. I will comment briefly on the texts included in this collection:

* Lands of Memory: during a journey by train from Montevideo to Buenos Aires, the protagonist, a young piano player, recalls formative events from his childhood and youth, and connects his awakening with a certain melancholy mood that tints his worldview. As he moves towards the future, he looks back on his past. We hear about his teachers (with whom he often becomes infatuated), his painful interactions with other youngsters, his experiences playing the piano, a visit to the dentist, a poetry reading, and perhaps most importantly, the sense of alienation that causes him to see his body and his self as two separate entities, a situation that is at the center of the posthumous _Diario del sinvergüenza_ (_Diary of a Shameless Man_). Objects and even words, simultaneously, are humanized. This is where César Aira’s _How I Became a Nun_ (1993), another creative memoir, comes from. Apparently, the novella is unfinished, but as with Kafka you can’t really tell.

* My First Concert in Montevideo: posthumous tale with a self-explanatory title. (Not to be confused with “My First Concert,” which is part of the collection _Nadie encendía las láparas_ and may be found in English translation in _Piano Stories_.) The protagonist narrates the events that accompanied his first performance in the capital. The concert has the quality of a test: with it, he hopes to bring some dignity to the family after the shameful trouble his father has had with creditors. The main theme, then, is the restoration of honor. In this case, the burden is on the son. The ending is grotesque, suggestive, and haunting.

* Mistaken Hands: a highly experimental tale that consists of letters to three women who may be the same woman, or who may not even exist. The writer talks about thoughts and impressions, and asks the women to write back to him. As is often the case in Felisberto’s prose, the tone is one of quiet desperation. A memorable portrayal of ennui. Don't look for plot here.

* The Crocodile: Kafka has his hunger artist; Felisberto, his crying artist. This is the story of a pianist that tries to make extra money by selling ladies’ hosiery. His life changes when he realizes that he has a talent for crying, and that this talent can help him with his sales. We have all heard the expression “crocodile tears” to which the title alludes. According to the _Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase & Fable_, “the tale is that crocodiles moan and sigh like a person in deep distress, to allure travelers to the spot, and even shed tears over their prey while devouring it.” The initial image of the protagonist “stealing anything with his eyes and taking it to his solitude” is beautiful, and 100% Felisberto. This tale is indisputably one of the most formally perfect in the author’s oeuvre.

* The New House: at the center of the story is the relationship of a pianist and the friend who organizes his concerts. The narrator feels disgust for a certain house that he associates with pretentious people who will not appreciate his music. He eventually gets the chance to meet the inhabitants of the house. Discussion of thoughts and feelings, similar to that present in “Mistaken Hands.” The phrase “entre el infinito y el estornudo” (“between infinity and a sneeze”) appears also in _Lands of Memory_.

* Around the Time of Clemente Colling: there is much of Proust in this character study of a blind pianist the protagonist knew in his youth. Colling is presented as a mystery, and the point of the text is not to explain this mystery, but to evoke it and celebrate it. I was reminded of a line from Proust: “...the two of us did not see her from the same side of the mystery” (_The Guermantes Way_, p. 211 in the Modern Library edition). The road from which we arrive at a certain person shapes our perception of him/her; _Clemente Colling_ is an excellent illustration of this. Nostalgia at its best.

One can tell a lot about an author by considering his/her admirers. Cortázar and García Márquez are among the many writers who have lit candles to Felisberto. He has not received a quarter of the praise that goes to the authors he influenced. He is the spiritual brother of Macedonio Fernández, that almost mythological figure who lived on the other side of the great river, is also called by his first name, and gave some shape to Borges. The giants are praised or condemned; the unsung heroes are the joy of a group of initiates, and that accounts at least in part for their charm.

_Lands of Memory_ is the best place to begin with Felisberto, but it does not include all of his masterpieces. You’ll be missing _The Stray Horse_, _The Flooded House_, “The Dark Dining Room,” “The Balcony,” and the haunting novella I still regard as the author’s masterpiece, _The Daisy Dolls_. You’ll find all of these in the collection _Piano Stories_, also published by New Directions, which I plan to review in the near future. These two volumes represent about a third of Felisberto’s literary output. If you read Spanish, the edition to get is the one published by Alfaguara, titled _Narrativa reunida_, which gives you Felisberto’s world in one volume. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34UMO7NMXKQEA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl[Don Quixote]

[[Piano_Stories]]
*Piano Stories* (2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Piano-Stories-Felisberto-Hernandez/dp/0811221806/[Amazon]

*****
The oddness of Felisberto Hernandez, the man, may perhaps eclipse the essential weirdness of his fictions. There is somewhat of a mystery surrounding him: he was a pianist who used to work accompanying silent movies. He traveled extensively, performing concerts. He took up writing somewhat later in life, remained more or less anonymous up to his death. Today, he is hardly known outside of Latin American literature and yet has inspired the so-called `magical realism' literary movement, made popular in the works of the Nobel-prize winning author, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Piano Stories, so named by the publishers because nearly every single story incorporates a piano, is the first collection of Felisberto's work translated into English. It is meant to serve as a representative exhibition of the writer's career. It features fifteen pieces, two of them being short novellas (`The Stray Horse' and `The Daisy Dolls') and some others no more than a page and a half long. The introduction is penned by Italo Calvino - another major writer who was apparently influenced by Hernandez.

The adjectives befitting the overall `feel' of the Piano Stories would be: elegant, absurd, surreal and otherworldly. There are repeated motifs of the nature of memory, as explored in the story `Just Before Falling Asleep' and `The Green Heart', and more extensively in `The Stray Horse' where the narrator is aware of an impending attempt to distort a series of childhood memories, for if a person were capable of changing his memories, as one changes stage settings, would that not result in a different person inhabiting the present? In `The Flooded House' a widow has decided that water has the inherent quality required for nurturing memory: "water is the place to grow memories, because it transforms everything reflected in it and it's receptive to thought." (Hernandez, P.246)

In these short stories, inanimate objects acquire a life of their own when viewed in certain light - furniture is able to reveal secrets about a person and in the eerie novella, `The Daisy Dolls', a man has an affair with a life-like replica doll of his wife.

Eccentric characters abound: in `The Balcony' the reader makes the acquaintance of an agoraphobic who believes that individual parts of her house have a soul. In `The Usher' the narrator, having grown accustomed to dark surroundings, acquires a persistent glow in his eyes.

Many of the stories proceed as hypnagogic trances, surreal romps through exotic surroundings. The writing style is average on the whole: a few genuine lyrical waves are balanced out by a number of slumps now and then, owing perhaps to the work's translation from Spanish. There are instances when the reader feels as if Hernandez does not quite know how to express clearly the ideas he has or to fully develop a consistent flow, as in `The Two Stories' or the unbearable `The Woman Who Looked Like Me'.

This collection of stylish pieces is enjoyable for its atmospheric engagement but in the end, looking behind the screen, the reader may come out empty-handed. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUBF07FABZ20/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811221806&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

Hilbig’s classic of East German literary intrigue still resonates in the age of mass produced misinformation. Set in the dwindling days of the East German Republic, the protagonist acts as both writer and Stasi-informant. Shifting, remarkably, from first to third person, Hilbig brilliantly navigates the shores of this densely structured novel. Reflecting on the strange affinity between writing and spying, I remains a powerful treatment of the criminality of art. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R358BEWAP9W225/[Steiner]

*****
If you're going to be stranded forever on a desert island and could take one book, which would it be? This is my choice. I've read it at least once a year for the past 20 years. Each time I have found it no less challenging...and no less rewarding. Each time I laugh, I cry, I rejoice and despair, and I tell everyone around me who will listen that they must read /Riddley Walker/. Hoban has written half a dozen breathtaking novels about life and death, history and the future, free will and predestination, human nature and human culture, belief and practice--and I can't for the life of me understand why he isn't considered Earth's Author Laureate. He has also written dozens of deep-hearted children's books, including the Frances The Badger series (which were greatly loved in my adopted home state of Wisconsin). Perhaps some of the reviews below make it clear why this man is so underappreciated. In this age of prefab thinking and easily packaged messages, he's just plain too challenging for most people. No spoon feeding. No easy outs. /Riddley Walker/ is not a book for people accustomed to hearing what they think they want to hear. But for people who can do the work of meeting him halfway...jeez, the riches! Hoban grapples with big questions in this novel: --Are we destined, as a species, to destroy ourselves? --What is violence, and why do people do it? --What is religion, and where does it come from? --Who, or what, is god? --What can we look forward to, if we continue trying to blow ourselves up? --Is there a relationship between maturity/immaturity and violence? --What is the nature of human memory? --What the hell *is* it with men, anyway? There is no sniveling in this book. The harsh, post-apocalyptic society that Riddley inhabits is what it is--people don't wander around whining about how things are. And yet there is a deeply touching moment where Riddley himself realizes how far humanity has fallen from what it once was. The grief of that simple moment impacted me far more than any accounts of nuclear/apocalyptic horror. It's easy to create megadeath. What's harder is the housework of the aftermath. There is nothing easy about this book. Nothing facile. Nothing shallow. Every word, every action, is holographic. Hoban's sense of humor is a joy. The puns, neologisms, back-formations, and memory fragments of his invented dialect lack all irony and self-consciousness. Riddley's tribal initiation as a man, and his manhood journey, are stunningly crafted and told. Showing us a world where an Iron-Age-scavenger people have inherited the principles of nuclear physics through oral tradition, while remembering (misremembering?) the green gods--Hoban nudges us, or maybe shoves us, in the direction of giving serious thought to who we are, where we want to go. This book is a wake-up call to a species of violent primates who mistake their hearts for evil and their opposable thumbs for divinity. And who have been taught to expect that language and storytelling should be easy. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDZF41XU56X4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0253212340&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Thomas Stearns]

*****
Mulder and Scully are hardly the first fictional spookchasers to ply their trade in our genre. Long before these postmodern ghostbusters began to lift ectoplasmic fingerprints, investigators such as Algernon Blackwood's John Silence and William Hope Hodgson's uni-cognomened Carnacki, supercilious resident of No. 472, Cheyne Walk, London, were called upon to wrestle with occult entities. In only nine strange stories, Carnacki managed to outfox numerous supernatural visitors to our plane--ranging from a jealous spectral horse to an horrific Ur-swine, from marine demons to a disembodied giant hand--as well as expose a number of hoaxers. Recounting his adventures from the safety of the fireside to four cipherish pals, including the frame-narrator, Dodgson, Carnacki veered between humility and arrogance. Often he would apologize along these lines: "I don't suppose you understand what I am trying to tell you, but I cannot make it any clearer." But he always ended every account by booting his buddies into the street with a hearty, "Out you go!"

Carnacki favored modern methods of spirit-trapping, including his Electric Pentacle and, in "The Hog," a rainbow ring of seven varicolored neon tubes. But he also relied on the wisdom contained in ancient codices, notably The Sigsand Manuscript. Hodgson's consistent "mythos"--his enemies dwelled in the "Outer Circles" that ringed our terrestial globe--and his apocryphal allusions to previous cases plainly paved the way for Lovecraft, an admirer of Hodgson and Carnacki.

William Hope Hodgson (1877-1918) will surely continue to be remembered more for such masterpieces as The House on the Borderland (1908) and The Night Land (1912). But had his career not been cut short in the trenches of WWI, he might have plumbed deeper into Carnacki's ghastly career. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cur0003.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*****
"IMAGINE a world inhabited by brownies, kelpies, and bogles, and you've imagined the legendary and mysterious Borders area of Scotland. Throw in a couple of giants, a demon or two, some courtly love, and a very large measure of satire, and you've got James Hogg's epic novel The Three Perils of Man. Perhaps best known for his supernatural character study Confessions of a Justified Sinner, Hogg (1770-1835), a native of the Borders, drew much of his inspiration from the ballads and folktales learned at his mother's knee. The Three Perils combines elements of romance, fantasy, and the small-group adventure we have come to know well from epics such as The Lord of the Rings, but Hogg's novel predated Tolkien's works by well over a hundred years.

The English have seized the Castle of Roxburgh. It's all just a game between English and Scottish nobles, but Sir Ringan Redhough knows the political implications of the contest. To help him decide which side to join, he sends his ambassadors to woo the great Borders wizard, Sir Michael Scott of Aikwood, into a foretelling of the future. This group consists not of smooth-talking flatterers but of men chosen for their unusual talents and wiles, such as Gibby Jordan, the silliest laird in the Borders; the "Deil's Tam," the crabbiest man in the Borders; and a monk who turns out, fortuitously, to be man-of-science Roger Bacon, the inventor of gunpowder.

The journey is fraught with peril from the malevolent forces that stalk the group at every turn, requiring epic feats of strength and cunning from the beleaguered band. Science clashes with religion, intellect with superstition, and when the Devil himself finally turns the lot of them into cattle, the key to the retaking of Roxburgh Castle just may be at hand." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2005/cur0502.htm[Connie Braton Meek]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0870081349/[Amazon]

*****
"Lord Emsworth's Annotated Whiffle: The Care of the Pig" is a book of legend familiar to anyone versed in P. G. Wodehouse's delightful "Blandings" series. James Hogg has edited the 756-page omnibus into a more tolerable treatise, along with Lord Emsworth's fictional commentary scrawled in the margins. All in all it's the most entertaining book on pig breeding and care I have ever read and will be respected, like the Berkshire pig, "wherever bacon finds favour." Between lessons on swine management, the notes about the entire Blandings crew and Emsworth's prized pig, The Empress, never fail to get a laugh from Wodehouse fans, though they will be difficult to decipher for those unfamiliar with the nuances and personalities of Blandings Castle.

The book also puts then contemporary history in perspective with illuminating narrative from England and the world. I was especially interested in two anecdotes, the first expounding on the pig keeping proclivities of Tolstoy: (p. 71) "It is a little-known fact that the late Count Tolstoy, the progressive landlord who was a novelist in his spare time, suffered great inconvenience while superintending the feeding of pigs. They ate several hundred pages in manuscript of a book he called 'War and Peace,' in the village of Bogorodovsk....It was the Count's habit, while touring his estate, to fill in the time by jotting down the light fiction for which he had discovered a talent." The second history lesson of note (p. 127) explains how a ban on Serbian pigs in Austria-Hungary in the tariff dispute of 1906 directly led to the outbreak of World War One.

If you have an interest in P.G. Wodehouse in general, Blandings Castle specifically, or pig keeping more specifically, I believe you will find the work of Whiffle as edited by Hogg is well worth your perusal. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8R9PNG4UKIU/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870081349&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Robert I.

"The Devil's Elixirs is predominantly a first-person narrative related by the Capuchin monk Medardus. He is ignorant of his family history and what he knows about his childhood is based upon fragments of memory and a few events his mother has explained to him.

Medardus cannot resist the devil's elixir, which has been entrusted to him and which awakens in him sensual desires. After being sent from his cloister to Rome, he finds a Count, disguised as a monk as a means of seeing his lover, and pushes him (whether intentionally or not is ambiguous) from a "Teufelssitz" ("devil's perch"). Unbeknownst to all involved, the Count is Medardus's half-brother and the Count's lover is his half-sister. The Count becomes his lunatic doppelgänger and crosses his path multiple times after Medardus abandons his ecclesiastical position, drifting throughout the world." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Elixirs[Wikipedia]

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140446311/[Amazon]

*****
The first thing that called my attention about this book is that, although it was written in 1819-1820, its atmosphere and plot are totally Medieval. These are the memories of the Tomcat Murr, written on the back of the leaves of the biography of musician Johannes Kreisler, printed as they were, so both stories (totally independent) alternate each other and are abruptly interrupted and continued at random stages.

Far from being a nusance, this "fact" or "narrative technique" is part of the charm. The only thing both stories have in common is the presence of Master Abraham, an interesting and lovable character. Beyond that, the tales run parallel. In a small and absurd German princedom there lives a toy court, dedicated to all kinds of firvolous and innocent entertainments, as well as minor intrigue. Master Abraham is an organ-builder and magician who has become the Prince's main adviser, and who has a tragic story. One day his protege, the sensitive and eccentric Kreisler, appears in the castle and revolutionizes the court's life. At first, he attracts the attention of a young Jewish girl, Princess Hedwiga's best friend and daughter of an ambitious lady, a former lover of the Prince's. Opposed to that, Kreiseler inspires in the nervous - and almost crazy - Hedwiga panic attacks, disguising a strong passion. The Jewish lady, who has other designs for both girls' future, conspires witht the Abbott of a monastery nearby, in order to expel Kreisler from court and convince him to take the habits, to which he refuses.

Meanwhile, the Tomcat Murr, Master Abraham's companion, relates us his life. This is an erudite, academic cat, possessed by an infinite love and the highest opinion of his own self, as well as plagued by bad luck wtih the cute kitties from his neighborhood. In a hilarious spoof of Bildungromans, Murr tells us about his sexual, intellectual and emotional growth. In the process of intertwining with Kreisler's story, the novel creates a farcic atmosphere. It contains numerous cultural references, and it is the confessed progeny of Don Quixote, Jacques the Fatalist and, above all, Tristram Shandy, in a softer tone. Hoffmann makes savage mockery of the minuscule and ridiculous German principalities and duchies which prevailed until 1870, as well as of all kinds of presumptuous academics, sending poisoned arrows to his contemporaries and including quotes from drama and epic poems, especially by Shakespeare, Ariosto, and Schiller. A light-hearted, enjoyable book which does much to illuminate a cultural, literary, social and popular tradition. - http://www.amazon.com/Life-Opinions-Tomcat-Penguin-Classics/product-reviews/0140446311/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=byRankDescending[Guillermo Maynez]

"The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr together with a fragmentary Biography of Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler on Random Sheets of Waste Paper is a complex satirical novel by Prussian Romantic-era author E.T.A. Hoffmann. It was first published in 1819-1821 as Lebens-Ansichten des Katers Murr nebst fragmentarischer Biographie des Kapellmeisters Johannes Kreisler in zufälligen Makulaturblättern, in two volumes. A planned third volume was never completed.[1] It was Hoffmann's final novel and is considered his masterpiece. It reflected his concepts of aesthetics, and predated post-modern literary techniques in its unusual structure. Critic Alex Ross writes of the novel, "If the phantasmagoric 'Kater Murr' were published tomorrow as the work of a young Brooklyn hipster, it might be hailed as a tour de force of postmodern fiction."[2]

An English translation by Anthea Bell was published in 1999 by Penguin Classics.

From the cover sleeve: "Tomcat Murr is a loveable, self-taught animal who has written his own autobiography. But a printer's error causes his story to be accidentally mixed and spliced with a book about the composer Johannes Kreisler. As the two versions break off and alternate at dramatic moments, two wildly different characters emerge from the confusion - Murr, the confident scholar, lover, carouser and brawler, and the moody, hypochondriac genius Kreisler. In his exuberant and bizarre novel, Hoffmann brilliantly evokes the fantastic, the ridiculous and the sublime within the humdrum bustle of daily life, making The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr (1820–22) one of the funniest and strangest novels of the nineteenth century."

Jeffrey Ford described the novel as a "complex, truly wild fiction" where Hoffman "pieced together the fragments of his own shattered psyche and commented on the relationship of art and artists to society." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_the_Tomcat_Murr[Wikipedia]

I am always hesitant to review a work in translation, such as this work. One can never be sure that the translator is not using his power as interpreter to become co-author, after all! On the other hand, the work was originally written in Latin, which is not as impenetrable a language as all that, so one assumes that if Mr. McNelis, Jr., was taking major liberties with the text, that someone would have called him on it. But translators are a wily bunch…

Ludvig Holberg was a Norwegian-born, culturally Danish Enlightenment philosopher and man of letters who did not write in English; he wrote many plays, historical works, poems, and essays. This was his only novel, and the novel as a genre was young although the romance as a genre was not. This work is much more a "romance" in the old tradition than a "novel", as it is intensely episodic and structurally 'messy'. Comparisons with Jonathan Swift's more famous Gulliver's Travels are highly justified. I am not a fan of the Enlightenment or the literature that it produced, so I personally did not much care for this, but if the eighteenth century is your period of choice, you will probably love this. I did appreciate the strong imagination and the utterly bizarre ending. Gryphons and wandering Jews, tiger-men and defecation…yes. So the book has its merits.

From the perspective of literary history, this work is very significant. Holberg is considered the founder of modern Danish and Norwegian literature, the "Molière of the North", and this work happens to be the first proto-science fiction novel about venturing into the earth's center.

The edition of this book is splendidly done - a preface *and* an introduction (woo!), excellent cover design, legible typeface––Bison Books, you spoil us! A bit pricy (hellaciously expensive now that it's gone out of print), so you might wish to cruise real-life used bookstores for this instead of a used copy on Amazon. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R369MTVT89AL19/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803273487&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Alexander Gaya]

*****
I'm really quite at a loss to describe The Quest of the Gole. It purports to be the epic tale of three brothers who must raise a curse on their late father's kingdom. But it also purports to be the (fictional, one assumes after a bit of research) story of a literary scholar trying to piece the tale together from various literary fragments; think of it as an ancient House of Leaves. And if it does end up being nonfiction, then it's a decent piece of scholarship, albeit in the docudrama kind of way.

As a piece of fiction, though, it's a whole new ballgame. Mr. Hollander's Opus (forgive the pun) is a stunning creation, both mock-scholarly and readable, and including such a wide range of various epic styles of poetry that it really does read like scholarship containing fragments from at least ten or twelve different poets who were writing between the first modern poems (around the time of Beowulf and "Summer is Icumen in") and the Renaissance. Technically, it is a masterpiece of the first water, and for that reason alone, it deserves a place in the canon.

But that is not all there is to the Quest of the Gole. There's also two cracking good storylines (the story of the Quest itself, and the researcher's flights of fancy in the uncovering of bits and pieces, which sits between the lines), more readable pages than you're likely to find in any of Hollander's other books (the man is a fine poet, but ease of reading has never been high on his list of priorities), some wonderful line drawings that make one think perhaps Roald Dahl was influenced by them a few years later when looking for someone to illustrate his first few childrens' books, and an all-around sense of luxuriousness rare from a simply-packaged hardback. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8B6VQGR1GNC/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DM3SC&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Robert Beveridge]

Despite its almost 400 pages this 44-year-old sci fi novel is a fascinating page-turner. I've forgotten more books than most people ever read, but this one has two (at least) unforgettable scenes. I'll leave one for you to discover for yourself, but you shouldn't miss an incredible description of the history of the world as read in the fossil record--from the bottom up. Start digging more than a half-mile down in the Earth, and take the trip upward from the dinosaurs on. Very well written, full of provocative ideas, and answers a question no one else ever asked: Are the Esks Eskimos, or are they not even human at all? This is a good-humored read with scenes of terror. If that seems contradictory, it's because Howard takes us on a wild trip (it's 1967, remember?) from Canada to Berkeley to China, from the CIA to the latest in penology, from cryogenics to mind control, with a poignant look at the law of unintended consequences. True to the era, bureaucracy is skewered, and political correctness takes a prescient beating. This one sat in a box lot of old sci fi paperbacks in my garage for years, until I had the good sense to give it a try. And found I couldn't put it down.

*****
The Original Wild and Crazy Guy, the Pasha of Palaverers, the Regent of Roisterers, the funniest writer in any language of the late Twentieth Century was the Czech Bohumil Hrabal (1914-1997). This collection of fourteen stories was complied by Hrabal himself and published in Czechoslovakia in 1966, with the title `Automat Svet.' I doubt that the stories were intended as a sequence -- they seem quite diverse in stylistic mastery, at least in English translation -- but they jostle together comfortably. The slightest mere anecdote among them is delightfully wry, while the best of them (the first two and the last three) are succinct masterpieces and precious examples of Hrabal's sardonic humanism.

"Palavering" is Harbal's speciality, his verbal `tag' for his own artfully erratic, elusive, elliptical literary format. Palaverers are his barroom raconteurs, his models of salty speech and scurrilous jests, and his own narratives totter as eccentrically as the homeward stumble of any tippler in Prague. But the tottering is camoflage for Hrabal's acute social/political criticisms; as a notorious drunken palaverer, perhaps Hrabal survived both the Nazis and the Communists simply by being too `wild and crazy' to be considered much of a threat. There's always a surreal Punch-and-Judy absurdity in Harbal's narratives, but his humor glazes dark depths of human/humane despair.

The last story in the book - Want to See Golden Prague? - is a slim seven-page precis of Hrabal's palavering, both a love-song to Life and to his own quirky life in Prague, and a dirge to the bleak history of his world in his times. Mr. Bamba, the prim dwarfish undertaker, and Mr. Kytka, the gigantic slovenly poet, walk along the river in Prague, on the far side of which the fire brigade is haplessly testing its pumps and hoses. Kytka wants Bamba to open his coffin warehouse to the surrealist poets of the city for a reading and lecture. The two discuss the trappings and the implications of such event while Kytka and the firemen shout insults at each other across the river. Kytka proposes to send engraved invitations to "Beautiful young ladies who wish to throw off the bonds of sexual hypocrisy... because reality is alcoholic." Eventually the two strollers start to palaver about the impact the mere sight of Golden Prague can have on sensitive individuals (though it isn't clear whether Prague is the real city or a synecdoche for passion). The massive poet offers to lift the tiny undertaker high enough to behold Golden pargue once more ....

Hrabal's four-page one-sentence "introduction" to this collection, his "Handbook for the Apprentice Palaverer," declares:
".... I am the great present of small expectations and great expected wrecks and wrong notes, the horizons on my own grotesque horizon glimmer with minor provocations and miniature scandals, as a result I am a clown, an animator, a storyteller, and private tutor as well as informer, poison-pen pal, I regard worthless news items as possible preambles to my constitution, which i constantly alter, which I can never complete, I see gigantic constructions in the roughest of sketches, even when they are no more than rickety old child-sized coffins, I am a man growing old but pregnant with youth, my facial expressions and words form the mobile grammar of my inner slang, within a half hour a warm plate of meat and a glass of lager can prove to me the transsubstantiation of matter into good mood, cheap metamorphosis, the world's first miracle ... "

Hrabal has become known to anglophones chiefly throught the films based on his novels "Closely Watched Trains" and "I Served the King of England." Those are both hilariously dark films, but the novels are even funnier and deeper in darkness. My own favorite among Hrabal's works is the novel "Too Loud a Solitude," which I have reviewed. But if you've never read anything by Hrabal, this collection of deceptively simple stories might well get you started. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R26J7GAQJN6L4C/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810127016&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Gio]

*I Served the King of England*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Served-King-England-Directions-Classic/dp/081121687X/[Amazon]

*****
"I Served the King of England" is not, as one might think, a novel about a devoted servant of the British Crown. Indeed, it is not about Britain at all. It is rather an account of the history of Czechoslovakia during the 1930s and 1940s as seen through the eyes of Jan Ditie, a hotel waiter. The title refers to another waiter, one of Ditie's colleagues, who is extremely proud of the fact that he did indeed once serve the King of England. Much of the first half of the novel deals with Ditie's rise from busboy to waiter to head waiter in a luxurious Prague hotel, where he too gets to serve royalty in the person of the Emperor of Ethiopia. (I use the Americanism "busboy", even though it is rarely heard in Britain, because it seems to me that we do not have any precisely equivalent term). I did not find this part of the book particularly interesting, as it consists of little more than a picaresque series of Ditie's moderately amusing anecdotes about his life in the catering trade, interspersed with some satirical passages at the expense of the gluttonous, avaricious and lustful Czech bourgeoisie of the pre-war years. It should be noted, however, that the proletarian Ditie fully shares their characteristics, especially lustfulness, as he spends most of his earnings on the services of prostitutes.

The novel becomes more interesting, and Hrabal's satire more biting, after the Nazis invade Czechoslovakia in 1938/39. Ditie does not allow this event to disturb his complacent lifestyle, but rather welcomes it because he has fallen in love with an attractive German woman named Lise, who is in good standing with the Nazi party, and he sees marriage to her as a way of helping himself to rise in the world. (he even justifies the invasion to himself on the grounds that it is necessary to protect the Sudeten Germans from the jingoism of the Czechs). His ultimate ambition is to own a hotel of his own, and briefly achieves this aim after the war, during the short democratic interlude between liberation in 1945 and the Communist seizure of power three years later. He raises the money by selling a collection of valuable stamps which Lise has stolen from their Jewish owners. (She, however, does not live to see her husband's triumph, having died during the war).

The novel was written in 1971, but could at that time only be published in an underground samizdat edition, as Hrabal was a dissident at odds with his country's ruling Communist party, which had tightened censorship following the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the crushing of the "Prague spring". Despite its satire at the expense of the bourgeoisie, "I Served the King of England" is not a work which would have been likely to improve Hrabal's standing with the Communists, as the events following their takeover are satirised even more mercilessly. (The puritanical regime might also have taken exception to the book's sex scenes). Ditie's hotel is confiscated, and he himself is sent to a prison camp for the wealthy, who are regarded as enemies of the people. Hrabal does not, however, treat the Communist prison system in the serious way that, say, Solzhenitsyn does in "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich". Rather, he treats this episode as a fit subject for farce. Ditie should have been spared imprisonment following the intervention of a former friend, now a Communist official, but manages to engineer his own arrest by proudly proclaiming that he is indeed a millionaire and even showing his bank-book to the police to prove it. His life in the camp itself is treated even more farcically, culminating in a scene where the prisoners change places with the guards.

The book is a first-person narrative, which means that everything is told from the viewpoint of Ditie himself. His surname derives from "dite", the Czech for "child, and there is indeed a good deal about him that is childish or child-like. He is, for example, short of stature and, more importantly, sees the world in a child-like manner, a mixture of naivety and self-centredness. He is quite unable to see the significance of the historic world events unfolding around him. except insofar as those events forward or hinder the satisfaction of his own desires. Optimism, and the belief that every cloud has a silver lining, are generally regarded as admirable characteristics, but in Ditie's case they are anything but. He is the sort of optimist for whom other people's misfortunes are the cloud and his own ability to profit thereby the silver lining.

The ending, in which Ditie achieves a sort of happiness while working as a road-mender in a remote mountain area, has been seen by some as a redemption, a realisation that (to borrow a phrase from Voltaire) "il faut cultiver notre jardin", and a rejection of greed and materialism. To my mind, however, this ending is deliberately ambiguous; it can also be interpreted as Ditie's final act of selfishness, a rejection of the society of others.

"I Served the King of England" takes a satirical look at Czechoslovak history, but its significance goes deeper than that- deeper, indeed, than a satire on Nazism or on Communism. Hrabal is making some sharp points about human nature and forcing us to confront the question of whether, in similar circumstances, we would have behaved better than his anti-hero Ditie. He is well-served by his translator Paul Wilson, whose text reads fluently and wittily. Had the opening part of the book been better, my rating may well have been higher. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVPOFWYA8C0TE/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081121687X[J C E Hitchcock]

EONS AGO, before videotapes and the Internet drove them toward extinction, softcore pornographic paperbacks were a lucrative market that enticed contributions from scads of respectable genre writers, such as Robert Silverberg, Dean Koontz, Lawrence Block, and John Jakes, many of them funneled to publishers via the famous Scott Meredith Literary Agency. Who lurked behind the "Dean Hudson" penname? According to Earl Kemp, who worked for Nightstand Books then, none other than Evan Hunter, a.k.a. Ed McBain. Having already published many stories in the sf zines of the fifties, McBain turned to that mode for The Robot Lovers, delivering a tale more Pohl-Kornbluth satire than a book to be read with one hand.

Working for Diversions Unlimited at the projected close of the 1960s, seeing himself as hip and swinging, Conrad Bullock's main job is sexually servicing gorgeous celebrities who license their likenesses for anatomically correct Barbie-type dolls. But when DU invents full-sized male and female sexbots, Conrad finds himself a neurotic fuddy-duddy longing for the good old days of man-woman carnality. Countering the robot fad involves public "sex bouts" that culminate with the titanic mating of Conrad and Hollywood star Nigeria Poitrine.

Eschewing most corny euphemisms (although breasts are frequently "bowls"), McBain gleefully skewers romance; psychology; New Age self-help (sexologists Bertha and Kurt Krankhaus); macho boasting; fashion; celebrities; advertising; the booboisie; and capitalism, foreshadowing later literary outings by Fred Saberhagen and Richard Calder. And fulfilling sf's mandate for predictions, he nails the current popularity of the full Brazilian—or the "bare-bottom" look as it is somewhat confusingly termed here. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2014/cur1407.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

"In an interview in 2000 Hughart blamed the end of the Master Li and Number Ten Ox series on unsympathetic and incompetent publishers. The style of his books made them difficult to classify and he felt his market was restricted by the decision to sell only to SF/fantasy outlets. As an example of publisher incompetence, Hughart notes that his publishers did not notify him of the awards given Bridge of Birds. He also points out that The Story of the Stone was published three months ahead of schedule, so that no purchasable copies were available by the time the scheduled reviews finally appeared; finally, the paperback edition of Eight Skilled Gentlemen was published simultaneously with the hardback edition resulting in few sales of the latter. When his publishers then refused to publish hardback editions of any future books, Hughart stated that he found it impossible to afford to continue writing novels, which brought the series to an end." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Hughart[Wikipedia]

*****
"My family name is Li and my given name is Kao and there is a slight flaw in my character." Thus does Master Li, who lives under the sign of the half-closed eye, introduce himself to Number Ten Ox, a peasant lad every bit as strong as his name suggests, but not nearly as dumb.
i
Ox has come to Peking to hire a Master to solve the mysterious ailment that has all of the children of his home village in its grasp, lying in a coma, apparently slowly dieing. But all of the Masters who reside in the Street of the All-Seeing Eye want too much for his village to pay before they will even consider taking the case... and then he finds the aged Master Li, dead drunk in his tiny ramshackle shack in an alley, with that half-closed eye over the door.

Master Li agres to take the case, and, after many hair-raising, often hilarious, sometimes touching, adventures, he and Ox manage to solve the case, answer ancient riddles, destroy a rapacious tyrant, and re-unite immortal lovers who have been seperated for centuries. The pace is fast, and never a moment's rest for the weary.

All is resolved more-or-less tidily and quite satisfactorily, leaving this reader somewhat the feeling of having just completed a ride on a particularly good roller-coaster.

Ox and Master Li are wonderful characters, complementing each other admirably. Ox, the narrator of their adventures, is actually quite bright and quick of mind, for all his peasant background; and that peasant upbringing has left him with a charming lack of what many would consider proper morals or scruples. In this he is perfectly suited to be Master Li's assistant, as Master Li has no morals at all -- well, he has a fairly strict moral code of his own by which he lives, but it's not even nearly that of Society.

Most people would probably describe Master Li as a Bad Man -- he drinks like a fish when he's not actually on a case and steals almost anything that isn't nailed down (and anything he can pry loose, in his opinion, isn't nailed down...) and quite willing to commit casual murders if that's what it takes to solve his cases.

Incredibly ancient (he gets older between this book and the next, at that), tiny and so wrinkled that sometimes his eyes disappear among the wrinkles, he is still brilliant, devious and fast with a knife when needed. Master Li goes into action riding on Ox's shoulders -- between them, there are very few foes natural or supernatural that they can't defeat.

And the ones they can't defeat outright, Master Li swindles.

In the course of this book, Ox and Master Li find themselves in and out of danger with a bewildering frequency, and have to solve a number of apparenly irrelevant riddles and mysteries before they can arrive at the ultimate cure for the children of Ox's village.

A wonderful book, highly recommended, as are the two sequels, "The Story of the Stone" and "Eight Skilled Gentlemen" (Ox, being an orphan, decides to relocate to the city as Master Li's permanent assistant and biographer).

Master Li and Ox live in "an ancient China that never was", as the book's subtitle explains; a China that is a wonderful place, with actual gods and demons and dragons and what not wandering around and fantastic magic at every hand.

(And thereby hangs a recommendation: if you enjoy the adventures of Master Li and Ox, i cannot recommend too highly the similarly-themed but even-more-elegantly-written adventures of Kai Lung, Ernest Bramah's itinerant story teller in a similarly fabulous ancient-China-that-never-was; "Kai Lung's Golden Hours" would probably be a good place to start, and i believe it's currently available...) - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PYPZKJS4C49N/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345321383[Fairportfan]

*****
"This is Hughart's second book, and the second Master Li and Number Ten Ox adventure. And while this book doesn't have quite the sheer delight of the first, "Bridge of Birds," it is still a wonderful adventure set in the same mythical China. And this novel confirms what you suspected after "Bridge of Birds" - Hughart is no fluke.

Chinese peasant Number Ten Ox, Master Li's client in the first book, is his assistant now, and troubled because it appears ancient Master Li may drop dead before another worthwhile mystery comes along. Ox need not have worried. The Abbot of the monastery in the Valley of Sorrows arrives with a tale of murder, terror and the return of the Laughing Prince, the lunatic despot who ruled the Valley of Sorrows 750 years earlier. How can Master Li resist the temptation? How can we resist?

Once again Master Li and Number Ten Ox must solve a mystery, and once again the mystery is fringed with the supernatural, homicide and genuine, laugh out loud developments. Along the way they meet some truly memorable characters, including Grief of Dawn, a young lady with a deeply mysterious past, and Moon Boy, a sound master and an entirely marvellous creation.

Perhaps the best invention is the characters' mind trip through the Chinese Hell, which makes the efforts of Orpheus and Dante look pretty pitiful in comparison. The ending is less of a stunner than "Bridge of Birds," but this story is a little more mature and tightly crafted than "Bridge."

The only fair criticism of "Stone" is that Hughart only wrote one more book, "Eight Skilled Gentlemen." There have to be Master Li stories not yet told; I wish Mr. Hughart would write them.

A wonderful story, amusing and moving, that exposes the reader to parts of Chinese mythology in the nicest possible way. Exceptionally well written. Highly recommended." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVTXXF8WD5NL9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EM8NPS[James D. DeWitt]

"I have written about Barry Hughart before ('Bridge of Birds') and how much I enjoyed his mock Chinese, tongue-in-cheek writing. This is the third novel (and the last) in his series about Number Ten Ox and Master Li, detectives, trouble-shooters, and general mischief-makers. The middle volume, 'The Story of the Stone,' is not presently in print, although chances of finding it used are still good.

The two find themselves in attendance at the Peking execution day, where the current royal execution is going for a record 1,071 clean decapitations. At the very last moment, a vampire ghoul makes a daytime appearance in hot pursuit of the city guard. This causes the Devil's Hand to miss his stroke, and Master Li jumps at the opportunity to investigate. Finding that one of the vampire's victims appears to be an august resident of the Forbidden City, Master Li confronts the Celestial Master (the wisest Confucian in the realm) and is invited to investigate what appears to be an impossible series of events.

Befriending a roving puppeteer and his beautiful daughter, Master Li and Number Ten chase across China looking for clues in what appears to be a complex smuggling plot that uses magical, golden cages as telephones. However, the cages are more than etheric portables, and the present holders of them keep meeting horrible fates at the hands of weird monsters and an ape. Who these creatures are, the purpose of the cages, and what any of this has to do with the annual Death Birds Ghost Boat Rain Race are the mysteries that Master Li has to solve.

This is a plot that sends the reader careening across the pages like a pinball in a bumper factory. The sense of the tale is always just beyond the reader's grasp as Hughart unfolds Number Ten's narrative at high pace. Readers who relish an orderly progression of development and characters that make dependable sense may find this a bit unsatisfactory. Hughart seems determined to exceed the more controlled chaos of 'Bridge of Birds' and this is not all for the good. I found the confusion a bit too ... confusing.

This is more of a burlesque, compared to Kai Lung's wry sarcasm, but it still works. Beware taking the plot for granted, since almost nothing is really what it seems. Hughart's ability to make impossible characters work is undeniable, and he has either a vivid imagination or access to a large collection of Chinese myths. While this tale is not up to the standards of 'Bridge of Birds' it is still a genuinely enjoyable read. And a pleasant change of pace for people for those who spend too much time with weightier tomes." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF0WL8IS0SDLD/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4WMT0[Marc Ruby]

*****
BEFORE Harry Potter, Billy Bunter was Britain's best-known schoolboy hero—or antihero. Created by Frank Richards for The Magnet in 1908, the bespectacled "Fat Owl" of Greyfriars School lied, cheated, stole, indulged in huge gluttony, and left any heroics to braver schoolmates.

David Hughes's comedy unveils a secret history in which the Greyfriars boys are real people: Frank Richards himself, Field-Marshal Montgomery, Pandit Nehru (the comic Indian lad), Oswald Mosley (the school rotter), novelist J. B. Priestley, future Prime Minister Anthony Eden, the Prince of Wales (later, briefly, King Edward VIII), and more.

Bunter himself—real name Archibald Aitken—has left his sticky fingerprints all over the twentieth century. In the world as it would be without his bumbling intervention, the noted murderer Dr. Crippen escaped, the Titanic never sank, World War I ended two years sooner with millions of lives saved, Edward VIII didn't have to abdicate after meeting a certain lady through Bunter, Mosley's UK Fascist party lacked its trademark black shirts—a specialty of Bunter's tailor—and D. H. Lawrence failed to write Lady Chatterley's Lover.

The narrator, a nostalgic fan of Bunter's fictional exploits, is jolted to learn that Aitken/Bunter is still alive. Incredibly aged, the Fat Owl has a vast fund of stories (some very tall) about his impact on society. Relevant papers were suppressed by the British government because "they embarrass the entire century. They make history itself look ridiculous." Can our hero expose the truth? Perhaps not…. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2010/cur1007.htm[David Langford]

"Bloodthirsty despots, fleabitten pirates, slick con-men and other knaves and tyrants make a memorable rogues gallery in this fetching miscellany of pseudo-biographical essays. Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges's 1935 satire Historia Universal de la Infamia, Welsh fantasist Hughes (Journeys Beyond Advice) profiles seven scoundrels whose unremarkable origins combine with unspeakable careers to give new meaning to the term "the banality of evil." Buccaneer François l'Olonnais was revered as a god by natives of the Yucatan because he feasted on the hearts of ritually sacrificed victims, while Dick Turpin, a legendary 18th-century highwayman, was an early example of the Peter Principle that incompetents are destined to rise to the top of their profession. In the cleverest of the accounts, "The Honest Liar, Denis Zachaire," an alchemist's conversion to debunker of others in his line of work represents his ultimate alchemical transmutation. Hughes relates his subjects' stories in a sober documentary style that contrasts sharply with their extravagant personalities and gives authenticity to the absurdities of their lives. At its best, this volume is a reminder that outrageous behavior is sometimes grist for comic fantasy with high entertainment value." - https://www.amazon.com/New-Universal-History-Infamy/dp/1892389835/[Amazon]

*****
Kurt Vonnegut once said, "All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies." In this regard, Vonnegut and Welsh author Rhys Hughes are cut from the same cloth. Like Vonnegut, Hughes is a truth spinner. His stories are fanciful and fun, and often his greatest lies reveal the deepest truths. Like its earlier incarnation, The Postmodern Mariner, Hughes' The Truth Spinner is a collection of well told truths disguised as brazenly flamboyant lies. In the author's own words:

"The worst kind of fib is the true one, especially if it's true only because the teller is unaware of its truth; the second worst kind is the one where both fibber and believer are in collusion. That kind has a name. Fiction."

The Truth Spinner might be fabulous fib. It might be fanciful fact. That is the pleasure and the wonder of Hughesian magic.

According to his bio, Hughes is "known for his original ideas, intricate plots and entertaining wordplay." Each of these is clearly on display in The Truth Spinner. Part one, `The Munchausen of Porthcawl' contains seven Castor Jenkins adventures that first appeared in The Postmodern Mariner. There is something of Maurice Richardson in these tales. `When Wales Played Asgard' has, in particular, the flavor of Richardson's Surrealist Sportsmen's Club. Arguably one of the best Castor Jenkins tales, `Interstellar Domestic' is purely Hughesian. It exemplifies the very essence of the Jenkins tales and begs the question, "who can prove that it never happened?" Certainly not Castor's pub mates, Frothing Harris and Paddy Deluxe.

Part two, `Tribulations of the Human Bean' contains five stories that reveal more about Castor than readers of The Postmodern Mariner were previously aware. In `Home Suit Home' for example, we discover how Frothing Harris and Paddy Deluxe "first became close comrades with the trickster, forging a friendship that would result in the loss of much cash and patience over a period of several strange decades." In `The Private Pirates Club' literary agent Thornton Excelsior tells his own Castor Jenkins tale. From `The Monkey's Pawpaw' to Excelsior's story, part two is Hughes at his unbridled best. Rife with wittiness and pun, `Tribulations of the Human Bean' makes The Truth Spinner a wonderfully worthy read.

With part three, "Castor on the Seven Plus Seas" Hughes invites us to follow Castor over the edge of the world, but warns, "Be sure to learn how to swim in ink and float on fables." In `Chuckleberry Grin' Castor Jenkins doesn't tell pub mates Paddy Deluxe and Frothing Harris a remarkable tale about his journey to Counter Earth with the mad inventor Karl Mondaugen. Castor Jenkins and Tin Dylan explore inner space in `Flying Saucer Harmonies' while in `Celebration Day' we learn the fate of Frothing Harris and Paddy Deluxe.

The Truth Spinner: the Complete Adventures of Castor Jenkins is a madcap masterpiece, made brilliant by the unrivalled wit of its author. Rhys Hughes is a rare gem. Few authors alive today share his ability to turn a phrase, to bend words at will and so effortlessly and artistically entertain. Humour is an art often lost on those who lack it. Very few do it well, but Hughes has mastered it. The Truth Spinner exemplifies his talent perfectly, and serves as a reminder that humour should be taken seriously.

And that's the truth. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RFG4WLZFWK1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434441075&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jason Rolfe]

[[The_Rebellion_of_the_Beasts]]
*The Rebellion of The Beasts: Or, the Ass is Dead! Long Live the Ass!* (1825)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Rebellion-Beasts-Dead-Long-Live/dp/0897335201/[Amazon]

*****
2004 saw the first publication of this gleefully savage satire in some 180 years, and I must say that the author of The Rebellion of the Beasts or, The Ass is Dead! Long Live the Ass!!! was brilliantly scathing in his allegorical attack on the English monarchy of his day. I found this book well-nigh hilarious in its obvious lampooning of political corruption and courtly behavior. It's not hard to see why the author, in 1825, published the work anonymously. The content of this book is just the sort of thing that could get you boiled in oil and/or separated from your head by a very much not-amused king. Strangely enough, however, the book seems to have come and gone rather quietly in its day, which explains why it has basically lain dormant for almost two centuries. Although the novel is attributed to Leigh Hunt, the identity of the author is by no means certain - I personally find compelling reasons to doubt the given attribution. It has obvious parallels with George Orwell's Animal Farm, but there is no evidence that Orwell ever perused this little gem of satirical genius.

In the story, the human narrator tells of how he snuck into the library at Cambridge as a prank and pilfered an old manuscript by Cornelius Agrippa, by which he learned how to brew a concoction that gave him the ability to converse with the animals. He acquires his amazing skill on the very eve of the animals' long-planned revolt against the vile, cruel human race. After a successful rebellion and the subjugation of man, the animals all come together to establish a government. The "Rights of Brutes" are quickly established as the first step to liberty and justice for all animals (except man, of course). Different factions soon emerge among the species, however. There were royalists, such as the royal horses, and ultra-royalists, such as the rats; natural predators who favored military despotism; moderate constitutionalists such as the sheep and goats; high democrats such as the raves and kites, and even terrorists such as the vultures and ravens. The strongest voice to arise from the debate, however, was that of the ass; this most power-hungry and deceitful of creatures quietly set about to gain power for himself via political intrigue, outright deception, general warmongering, and complicity with the equine wife of a leading royalist. Political enemies are identified and eliminated in alarming fashion, until such time as the ass centralizes all power in himself alone. As dictator, the ass determines all policy, proclaims the one and only state religion, and eliminates any individual or species he views as a threat.

This is where the story turns truly hilarious. Much time is devoted to a description of the ass's royal court. Courtiers show their respect for the ass by licking his tail, and the author describes the protocol of licking tail in gleefully great detail. We are also treated to a number of official titles for the donkey king, all of them along the lines of "his asinine majesty." The priestly class of elephants is also skewered. We learn how an amazing number of half-elephant offspring start turning up all over the place, an oddity given the fact that the elephant priests are so known for their chastity and faithfulness to their elephant wives (albeit rumors abound that certain priests disregard gender as much as species in these matters). We hear all about the Book of Morals, the authoritative religious work that is only valid when elephant feces have marred great portions of the actual writing. I could go on, but you get the idea. Alas, the great dictatorship of the ass is brought down by none other than the queen, whose infidelity marked a divide that ends in bloody revolution.

This is rapier-sharp allegorical castigation of the king and court of merry old England at the time of original publication, political and social satire told with the greatest of wit. The author ascends to new heights of satirical prowess. Even in our own time, it is by no means difficult to see what the author is actually saying in this allegorical description of the rebellion of the brutes. Comparisons with Orwell's Animal Farm will doubtless get The Rebellion of the Beasts more exposure than it might otherwise get, but this newly recovered novel is of great merit in and of itself. There is no shortage of power-hungry asses in the world today, and the allegorical traits described in this book apply very well to modern governments of all kinds. The price of freedom and liberty is eternal vigilance, and The Rebellion of the Beasts shows you the very personality traits and manners of political subterfuge to always be on the lookout for. Plus, lest we forget, it's a viciously funny read. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNVGVHRI6QR5/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0897335201&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Daniel Jolley]

This brilliant satirical novel is a simple and fun profile of post-revolutionary Russia and the various ways in which society has changed as a result of the communities new social mores and laws along with the immediate, new inconsistencies. The book is hilarious, and I wish that I knew a great deal more about the historical implications of the satire that exists in the book because I am sure that the book would have been a lot more funny for me with an original context. Furthermore, in the translation I read, there were clearly some places that i knew that there were some linguistic jokes that the translators had to do their best to translate either with explanation or with a somewhat similar approach that were ruined because I was reading a translation. Even without the cultural and linguistic knowledge that makes this an incredible Russian classic in Russia and Ukraine, I still found myself laughing aloud and having a great deal of fun as I read.

The book is a quixotic journey novel where two men, Vorobyaninov and Bender, are searching for fortunes that were hidden in a chair, and as they find each individual chair, they need to con one another as well as the people they are interacting with in order to get their hands on the piece of furniture that may or may not contain the fortunes. The book is somewhat predictable in the sense that it is obvious that they will not be finding the right chair until the end, but it is the manner in which the audience is surprised as well as the innovative method that the story is told with postmodern awareness and skilled nods to Shakespeare and Mark Twain (whose book Huckleberry Finn, and the escapades of Huck with the Duke and the Dauphain are very similar to other situations in this book).

I really enjoyed this book, and would have enjoyed it more if I had known Russian and more about the cultural and social post-revolution Russian landscape beyond what I have gotten in Tolstoy, Pasternak, Orwell, and others. I really look forward to watching the Mel Brooks film, which I actually own but have never watched. I only have a couple gripes about this edition that I read. I feel that the translation was very utilitarian rather than artistic, and it would almost make sense to have read a version that was footnoted for the historical and satirical references to help, as well as better translated for the linguistic jokes that I know that I was missing. Finally, the Kindle edition I read had some spacing issues and had to be read in only one size font, horizontally in order for the sentences to fit the page. Otherwise, the margins were all messed up because it was clearly copied and pasted from the web with line-by-line formatting that did not translate to the kindle version. I am almost tempted to publish a newer version with footnotes / xray, and at the very least margins that format correctly. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GMJSOQTH0P95/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810114844[Garrett Zecker]

Well ... here's the thing. For reasons I won't go into here, I've had occasion to own and read ALL the English translations extant of both THE TWELVE CHAIRS and its sortakinda "sequel" THE (LITTLE) GOLDEN CALF. (The discrepancy in the title of the second is due to a peculiarity of Russian, which lets you make a diminution of calf without quite saying little calf; it's a construction, not an adjective, and there's no English equivalent. But it's similar to Yiddish, in which the name David, which translates as Duvid, can be turned into Duvidl [DOO-vid-ul] both as an endearment or as a nickname for a youngster.)

Anyway, having read them all, carefully, comparatively and cover-to-cover, I can say this with absolute assurance: no matter which you read, if you're reading solely for pleasure, you'll get an accurate representation of the book. To be sure, each iteration carries its translator's/translators' imprimatur, but all are similar of tone and content (notwithstanding that some of the early translations are not quite as complete, which matters more academically than aesthetically). None is perfect, but none shortchanges you.

In making consumer comparisons, one should probably dispense with the first version of THE TWELVE CHAIRS (published as DIAMONDS TO SIT ON) by Elizabeth Hill and Doris Mudie, and the first of THE LITTLE GOLDEN CALF (under that title) by Charles Malamuth, both from the 1930s, long out of print and likely never to be reissued. Which leaves John C. Richardson's versions of both THE TWELVE CHAIRS (still in print and available as a free download at one of the open library sites, having apparently slipped into the public domain) and THE GOLDEN CALF (under that title), which is out of print but "gettable" via antiquarian sites, in paperback and (sometimes expensively) in an omnibus edition with CHAIRS, called THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES OF OSTAP BENDER. And of course the new translations: THE GOLDEN CALF by Konstantin Gurevich & Helen Anderson, THE LITTLE GOLDEN CALF by Anne O. Fisher, and Ms. Fisher's even newer version of THE TWELVE CHAIRS.

For the smoothness of the read, and the best delivery of natural-sounding, idiomatic English, Richardson is a little subdued (perhaps because he's British, and too because his work reflects his era, the 1960s) but sturdy, dependable and above all entertaining. Reading either book -- again, if pleasure or expanding your world literature horizon is the goal -- you can't go wrong.

However, his is not the liveliest, most energetic job of prose and dialogue; that honor goes to Gurevich-Anderson's THE GOLDEN CALF (2009). But comparing their version to others, it would seem less accurate to the letter of the text than the spirit of the text (but not so interpretive that it distorts). There's a conscious effort here to eschew all vestiges of archaicism and make the prose sound not updated but contemporary.

Anne Fisher's versions of THE TWELVE CHAIRS (2011) and THE LITTLE GOLDEN CALF (2009) would seem to be the most academically accurate, but the trade-off is that they're not consistently *as* entertaining, and sometimes sacrifice liveliness on the altar of literalness. But the entirely worthwhile trade-off, to those for whom such is important -- and it was for me -- is that her books trump the others easily for scholarship. Introductory essays, appendices of detailed footnotes, in CALF an extra appendix flagging some of the Ilf & Petrov phrases that entered everyday Russian speech, are rich and valuable sources of information and provide the widest possible context for a Western world reader.

Don't be sucked in by any of the "translation smackdowns" you may find online or at Amazon regarding these titles. (i.e. while it's true that Ilf's daughter, Alexandra, authorized the Gurevich-Anderson translation of CALF, she nonetheless wrote her foreword for the Anne Fisher translation; and another for Fisher's CHAIRS.) No version is a bad choice. But knowing what each version has to offer should help you decide on the one(s) that you'll find most gratifying. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T757SS8U39FN/[Pelaphus]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Ilf-Petrovs-American-Road-Trip/dp/1616892528/[Amazon]

*****
Apart from this book's obvious value as a humorous and intelligent look at 1935 America, it is most interesting for showing the many respects in which FDR's New Deal America was already fixed in many of the cultural and political ruts in which we still find the U.S. It can be so revealing because it observes the ordinary and the stupid as keenly as the elite and accomplished. (As a result, the book's occasional smugness will certainly grate on some American readers. The authors describe to us an incurious and unthinking people and are most dated by their certainty that the economic stagnation of 1935 is a loud and final trumpet-blast giving the final verdict on the American kind of capitalism. Maybe it was, in some ways, but in general this is facile in retrospect, especially in comparison with the Soviet trajectory. The point of this positive review is how much truth comes through despite this somewhat churlish--though always witty--attitude.)

The very premise of the book is that knowledge of the nation comes on a road trip, that the rhythm of stopping at gas stations and proceeding along endless highways is somehow definitive of America. Ilf and Petrov ponder the essential sameness of so many American towns. The book begins at once with New Yorkers' and Washingtonians' admonitions to the authors that the "real America" lies somewhere else, out on the roads sprawling westward. (The New Yorkers' children meanwhile, they observe, learn what a cow might be like by looking at the rhino in the Central Park Zoo.)

Some of what Ilf and Petrov hear in 1935 America is disgustingly familiar to us still: otherwise thriving families bankrupted by medical expenses; the ordinary man's belief that it's all right to soak the rich with progressive taxation so long as we leave them $5 million (around $75 million today) -- $4 million being perhaps not generous enough; Santa Fe overrun by millionaires; Los Angeles characterized by the peculiar ineradicability of exhaust in its air, and by a plenty of oranges that look better than they taste. (Americans, they observe, seem more interested in vitamins than taste.)

The authors' dark diagnosis of America is perhaps most fascinated by the role of advertising and idiot mass culture. They observe that an American might well graduate from a series of excellent schools, but that a few years of watching the dreck from Hollywood will stupefy them soon enough (and this was clear to them some years before the advent of commercial TV). They see that many of America's churches, schools, and journalistic organs serve, in effect, to reinforce this same effect of the movies, that "publicity" defines a wider theater of thought invasion than just the explicit ads. They are amused that Christmas is advertised in much the same way as Coca Cola, and for the same reasons. They understand how corporate branding really works--the irrelevant advertisement whose work is done just by making you pay attention to it.

They look at the business end of consumer culture, too, amazed at how much crap you don't need you will buy when everything at Woolworth's costs a nickel or a dime.

These are just some of the ideas that made an impression on me; I have omitted most of the book's topics, such as a notable report on how whites think (or, more accurately, do not think) of the blacks they keep down.

One note about what this book actually is: it is NOT an English translation of the authors' 1937 book Odnoetazhnaia Amerika (Single-Storey America). Not only does the introduction fail to clarify this, but the book's Library in Congress cataloging-in-publication is utterly erroneous in claiming this. The book SEEMS to be a (complete?) translation of the photo essays printed in the periodical Ogonek. The disadvantage of this is that you are missing the vast majority of the authors' writing about America (just at random, here are some chapters of Odoetazhnaia Amerika not represented here: The Electric Chair; Dearborn & Henry Ford; American football; A day in Mexico)--however, the entire book was immediately translated into English by Charles Malamuth and published in 1937 by Farrar & Rinehart under the title http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LWK7H8/[Little Golden America: Two Famous Soviet Humorists Survey These United States] (not in print). But the huge advantage of this format is that it includes the photographs--which are half the fun of the whole thing (and whose omission from the 1937 book deprived it of much of its meaning, since many passages refer in detail to the subjects photographed). So I'd certainly recommend this volume as an introduction to Ilf and Petrov, and curious readers can hunt down "Little Golden America" afterwards. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LY0QZGFBYIGQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616892528&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[T.

Gary Indiana's first novel since Do Everything in the Dark is a hilarious satire, the most linguistically exuberant work yet from an author already deservedly admired for his astonishing prose. Giddy anachronisms abound in this bawdy tale that features a drug-addicted doctor accompanying a Scotland Yard inspector in pursuit of the fiendish Fu Manchu, who may or may not have something to do with strange occurrences in the seaside town of Land's End, a damp pocket of sleaze that time forgot, whose denizens sleep during the day and emerge for depraved revels come nightfall. Along the way there are all sorts of wonderfully sketched cameos, including Thalidomido the dwarf, Dr. Philidor Wellbutrin, "the fartsome abortionist," and Earl Sludge, the garbage truck driver turned opportunistic necrophiliac. Among the most comically inspired bits are the gossipy phone conversations between the diabolical Fu Manchu and his mercenary employee, the club-footed ex-STASI Roswitha Klebb, whose logistical discussions concerning Fu's campaign for world domination get continually sidetracked by their shared passion for the labyrinthine plot of a Brazilian soap opera. Ribald satire, narcotic phantasmagoria, a gruesome Cronenbergian transformation, mysterious portals in spacetime, corrosive (and hysterical) social commentary all amazingly cohere in a satisfying narrative due to Indiana's prose mastery, simultaneously flamboyant and rigorously controlled. This is a wonderfully unhinged book, Indiana totally unfettered. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QT4JWEBW916S/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982015100&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ronnie Cordova]

*****
Three Trapped Tigers (Latin American Literature Series) by Guillermo Cabrera Infante is high on my list of the greatest difficult books that I did not quite understand but that I loved anyway.

Imagine, if you will, a book that could be the love child between James Joyce and Gertrude Stein; better yet of a ménage a trois including Lewis Carroll; no, even better yet, an orgy including the three above along with William Faulkner, Virginia Wolfe, Papa Hemingway, Christopher Marlowe and/or William Shakespeare, T. S. Eliot, Alejo Carpentier, and a legion of many other legendary writers as well.

Then imagine Finnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin) set in Havana. Yes, and what James Joyce's Ulysses did for Dublin, G. Cabrera Infante's Three Trapped Tigers (Latin American Literature Series) does for pre-revolutionary Havana, Cuba.

First published in Spain in 1964, TRES TRISTES TIGRES was translated in 1970 in collaboration with the author from the original Cuban into English by Donald Gardner and Suzanne Jill Levine. Even in translation every word not only comes alive but dances the Mambo from one uncontained, dizzying page to the next.

THREE TRAPPED TIGERS really is much like FINNEGANS WAKE or ULYSSES inasmuch as you either love it or you hate it; and if you hate it I suspect that it's because you could not get through the first few chapters and gave up on it. I too was initially confounded and almost dismissed this book because I was afraid it was over my head. I was feeling quite stupid to be honest with you but I was also dazzled by Infante's literary pyrotechnics. I was confused but I was also engaged. So I decided to forget meaning, forget plot, and just marvel at the brilliant word play and spectacular inventiveness.

Have no concern, my reading friend, if you cannot follow Infante's meanings within meanings. Just take in this exuberant, fascinating book and go with its pulsating, rhythmic flow...let the words perform the magic of recreating a Cuba of depth and passion, of humor and sadness, of fantasy and reality, of imagery and truth, of beauty and love.

My dear reading friend, do not be afraid of Infante's Joycean exercise in stream of consciousness writing or the way he flings portmanteau words at you, or words he has dissected, mutated and reconstructed. Accept that you will not comprehend everything - the allusions, colloquialisms and sarcasm; the puns, jokes and palindromes; the bon mots, double and triple entendres and free dream associations; the philosophical discourses, surreal dialogue and rapid-fire repartee - and give yourself permission to cachinnate and chortle when you do! Just begin at page one and enjoy the exotic, cerebral, tragicomic ride you will embark upon, a trip to the kaleidoscopic world of 1950's Havana nightlife.

Do not worry either about keeping track of the many characters and raconteurs you will meet. You will be introduced to a motley array of writers and musicians, singers and photographers, prostitutes and homosexuals, mulattos and dwarves, wealthy Cuban debutantes and annoying American tourists...all populating a steamy, sizzling, spirited narrative of metalanguage that will seduce and intoxicate you.

THREE TRAPPED TIGERS is like a thousand piece puzzle with each interlocking piece a tiny part of a bigger picture of the Cuba that once was - little bits and pieces of place and culture, literature and art, music and film, philosophy and science, mathematics and psychology, old Havana's urban culture and 1950's Cuban social criticism. Begin patiently with one piece at a time and let the words do the work of completing the fabulous, stunning collage. Then revel in the reading experience. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R16W7FOP2MDC3Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569247137&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Evelyn Getchell]

*****
An inventive and animated account of night life in Havana before Castro`s regime, narrated by four friends who are trying to build their careers and end a day "not with a whimper but a bang".

Using puns, tongue twisters, palindromes and wisecracks, they retell their own adventures and comment on their friends`, and make jokes by constantly twisting out the meaning of each word or phrase they say. They engage in parodying episodes and quotations from world literature (English & American influences include Shakespeare, Sterne, Poe, Melville, Carrol, Hemingway, Faulkner, Eliot, Joyce, and many others) and scenes from popular films (the novel itself is an attempt to reconstruct a film "P.M.", by Cabrera`s brother, destroyed by Cuban censorship). They turn all these upside down, creating a hilariously funny novel whose language is always on the move and where every word has at least a double meaning.

Underlying their humour, however, is a bitter feeling of emptiness and deprivation, inability to understand others and be understood. Faced with a paradox that you cannot talk about serious things in a serious way without taking a risk of being funny, you come to realize that humor is our only weapon on "...an island of double or tripple entendres told by a drunk idiot signifying everything."

"First of all, the story begins with a train journey. We settle in for a comfortable trip down into the English countryside. But comfortable for whom? Not Inspector Appleby, in a stuffy, frigid carriage littered with Sunday papers (and their lurid contents which bear all too much relevance for the mystery ahead). He muses learnedly of mythological figures such as Persephone, and the more recent legend of Emma Bovary. But after three or so pages of this (admittedly rather heavy going), we find ourselves in the fantastical and eccentric country of the Innes' imagination, where villages bear names like Sneak, Snarl, and Abbot's Yatter--not to mention Boxer's Bottom. Oh, and did I mention a place called Drool? The mythology is relevant, but forget about trying to untangle the plot--not that you have a chance in hell.

Have you ever had the kind of English cake made of a sort of eggy batter which is just there to hold together large amounts of fruit and nuts? Appleby's End is like that cake, and the story line is just there to hold countless humorous jokes between the book covers. The lurid conversation of Billy Bidewell, the interview with Gregory Grope, engine driver (concerning the sex life of his grandmother), the revelations chez Hoobin, the remarks of Father Smith ( a sort of English version of a Chinese zen master) and last but far from least, one of the most unusual courtships in any novel are the highlights, but there are countless little jokes as well.

There are a dozen or so Innes books which I read and reread..but Appleby's End is in a class by itself.

*****
Arabian Nightmare by Robert Irwin is a novel about thriller, horror and paranoid fantasy of Balian, a spy who failed to perform his duty in Cairo, Egypt. Balian, who came to Egypt through Alexandria, as part of Pilgrimages to St Catherine in Sinai Hill had to stay in Cairo for three days before continuing their journey since the grandson of Sultan of Mamluke was going to be circumcised, a big party would take place. Balian who came not only as pilgrim but also as a spy to learn the Mamluke movement went to Mareotis Beach where he met Giancristoforo Doria who then told the story of a father who would kill a son for two dinars. It indeed happened and the play was real as if he indeed had mutilated his son. After getting paid the money, they left; but the next morning in Alexandria, they both were seen in front of a cafe having breakfast, well and so healthy. That was the first perfect illusion to be encountered in Cairo.

Balian red the book Giancrostoforo left, written in Arabic with some rough English translations in between paragraphs. Very Strange. After reading the book, he began to dreams non-sense things. When he woke up, his mouth and nose were bleeding, his body was aching. He also met Zuleyka, a whore who taught him sex lessons. After meeting Michael Vane and he were told that he had the Arabian Nightmare disease attacking his brain and known it had been done by an ape, a creature of jinn or Satan.

Balian was cured by the Father of Cats, an alchemist curer who had a 'House of Sleeping' designed for all the victims of such disease. He became more unstable and nearly insane, his sickness became worst from day to day especially after his visa request had been denied by Dawadar officials, he suffered and his condition was not much better than a suffering beggar. He went in and out the 'Alam al-Mithal' where his existence was unclear whether he was in the real world or inside the world of fantasy. He met strange creatures, jinn, demon, devil, Satan, and various kinds of creatures from different life zones.

It came to a time that the crime detected and discovered. The Father of Cats was behind everything concerning the Arabian Nightmare disease. He created it. He murdered people, sent diseases to others and all bad things. Eventually he was captured by the Sultan of Dawadar from Mamluke. Balian was healing and he returned healthy. He could eat well now.

At last he decided to find Zuleyka who was found out to be an insane lady of Sultan. By the end the story ends, readers will still question whether what happened to Balian is real or just a fantasy . . . - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U853DF4QC5H/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X76SR0Y[Arthur431]

*****
This excellent book by Robert Irwin is essential reading for anyone who really wants to understand "The Thousand Nights and One Night", also known as "The Arabian Nights", "The Arabian Tales", and "The 1,001 Nights". As you probably know, these famous stories were supposedly told by Scheherazade to King Shahriyar over the course of 1,001 nights. Scheherazade kept the King enthralled with cliffhanger endings each night, postponing his plans to execute her until he grew to love her and changed his mind. This book will do several things for readers interested in these stories.

First, the introduction and first chapter will help discerning readers decide which edition to read. That doesn't mean that you necessarily have to follow Irwin's recommendations, but you'll be able to make an informed decision. For instance, while he rightly criticizes the accuracy of the Mardrus/Mathers edition, that is the most readable "complete" version; I read it and enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to those who are more focused on reading something entertaining than on authenticity. But if you do read Mardrus/Mathers, you'll know it's only a loose adaptation of the original Arabic sources. This brings up another point which Irwin makes, which is that there is no authentic version even in Arabic; in reality there are multiple Arabic editions in which different stories occur in different versions.

The book will also give readers a much better understanding of the stories themselves and the cultures from which they originated. Note that more than one culture was involved since there are Indian, Persian, Syrian, and Egyptian sources. Irwin focuses on the ways in which the stories were orally transmitted in Arab societies and provides details about how this shaped the stories to attract listeners. This helps readers understand why the stories are filled with religion, poetry, epic tales, love stories, aphorisms, jokes, magic, fantasy, sexuality, criminals, and assorted other features.

Finally, Irwin provides literary analysis of the stories and connects them to story collections and other fiction in other cultures, Eastern and Western, ancient and modern. This includes influences on Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales", Boccaccio's "Decameron", Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso", western fairy tales, William Beckford's gothic novel "Vathek", "The Saragossa Manuscript" by Jean Potocki, and Robert Louis Stevenson's "New Arabian Nights" before the 20th century. Influences in modern literature can be found in "Ulysses" and "Finnegan's Wake" by James Joyce, the writings of Jorge Luis Borges, the works of John Barth, and the novels of Salman Rushdie.

I highly recommend this book to all of you who love the fantastic world of the Arabian Nights and would like to learn more about the origins and influences of these wonderful stories. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GN1P7VAKZ2IV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1860649831&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Roger Berlind]

Finally available again in the United States, The Limits of Vision is Robert Irwin's irrepressibly entertaining and imaginative novel about a young housewife named Marcia and the war she wages against dirt.
Set over the course of a single day as Marcia goes about her quotidian activities-having the girls over for coffee, tidying the house, making dinner-it becomes increasingly clear that her sanity is unraveling at an alarming rate. Irwin is at his creative best here, as he describes Marcia's conversations with Mucor, the "mouthpiece for the Dirt, the Empire of Decay and Ruin, the Principle of Evil," as well as such scientists and artists of the past as William Blake, Charles Dickens, Leonardo da Vinci, and Charles Darwin. - http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Contemporary-English-language-fiction/dp/1873982100/[Amazon boilerplate]

*Exquisite Corpse* (2003)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1585673862/[Amazon]

*****
Robert Irwin's literary masterpiece, Exquisite Corpse sends the reader into a surrealist world of deception and dreams. His use of informal language captures the tone of the novel completely and adds to the sincerity of the work. The creation process of art correlates with the progress of Exquisite Corpse as Caspar discovers his muse of inspiration, Caroline. The novel is a first person account of Caspar's life, sort of a journal kept through his most intruiging portions of life. As interpreted by Caspar, the reader is often challenged with the thought that perhaps Caspar is making up the story as he goes along. That perhaps none of his experiences are true and that he is a pathetic drunk trying to make some sense of his life through broken memories. Irwin's use of words and imagery create a new universe as seen through Caspar's eyes. His quirky friends and enemies all have the feel of opera characters--highly overexaggerated and overdramatic. As for Caroline, she has the feeling of a non-existent dream. Did Caspar dream her up or was she real? Was Caroline the embodiment of all of his desires and fears in life, the fear of rejection and the loss of love? Or was she a human being? Only the author knows the truth and we are left to figure out this mystery ourselves. Yet, what Irwin creates is a man, lost of all reason, lost in his thoughts and dreams, making up the perfect ending to his tired life of love lost and turmoil. All in all, Exquisite Corpse is a trip through the mind of a surrealist, mind you, it's not a smooth running course, but a course that has no boundaries whatsoever. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INH4IWDPDAFZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585673862&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*Satan Wants Me* (1999, 2015)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Satan-Wants-Me-Robert-Irwin/dp/1903517583/[Amazon]

*****
Robert Irwin is the author of one of my favourite off-beat, phantasmagoric novels - 'The Arabian Nightmare', which I rank right up there with Gustav Meyrink's 'The Golem' and 'The Green Face', and with George MacDonald's 'Phantastes'. With themes including sex, Satanism, the Sixties, Rock and Roll, London, and drugs (lots of drugs), you might have thought 'Satan Wants Me' would have been a sure-fire bestseller. It was first published in 1999 but I don't recall it being a bestseller, at least not on this side of the Atlantic, and the reason might be that it has a fatal flaw, disqualifying it from bestsellerdom -it is written too well. A novel with such a lurid title surely promises legions of scaly, over-wrought red demons and other tenebrous denizens of the sub-sub-basement, or perhaps serial exorcisms of nubile nymphets due to multiple Mephistophelian possessions at a girl's school combined with an invasion of infernal, bestial field mice? No, sorry. No wavy daggers. And not a baby sacrifice to be found. No humourless, homicidal albino monks either. What we do have is a very good and ultimately unsettling story, cleverly written in the form of a diary. I like this point of view when it is done well because, while it is intimate and really puts the reader inside the head of the protagonist, it is also circumscribed -you are largely limited to just one perspective and you are reading about events after the fact. You are not only limited by how the writer of the diary is limited in seeing the world, you are limited by what the writer wants to tell you. This perspective forces you as the reader to work -to put together the pieces of an incomplete puzzle and guess at what the missing ones might be.

The story is about a shallow, confused, hip young man working on his graduate thesis in London in 1967. He and his girlfriend become involved with an occult group that takes itself very seriously indeed. About a third of the way through the book, I thought I knew exactly where everything was heading and that I could predict the ending. I was quite wrong. Although there is an abundance of humour in this tale, its overall effect was unsettling on a number of levels. Uncanny events are believably portrayed. There are parts that I found genuinely disturbing. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R27FGTX54HJXFG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1903517583&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Joseph Davis]

*****
" Kyra Kyralina marks the beginning of what has come to be known as the Adrien Zograffi cycle. This series of tales set in the waning years of the Ottoman Empire had, by the time of Istrati’s death in 1935, amassed into more than a dozen novels, and had earned Istrati accolades as one of the pioneers of modernism. The Zograffi books had even been compared to Marcel Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu. But as Kessel points out in his preface, Istrati’s death, the dissolution of his publishing house, and the war all conspired together to send his work into oblivion for a third of a century until the Gallimard edition appeared in 1968.

...

But even were Kyra Kyralina scratched into dirt with a stick, one would be hard pressed not to recognize in it storytelling of the highest order. One reads Kyra Kyralina in large gulps. Its narratives “nest” within a framing device such as one finds in story cycles such as The Arabian Nights or the Decameron, beginning guilelessly and timorously with the young Adrien’s first leave-taking from home, then plunging one into tales of high drama and exoticism combined with a gripping realism. Adrien serves as the conduit for these tales, gathering them from the singular characters he encounters. In Kyra Kyralina, the story idles along until it meets one of these figures, Stavro, whom Adrien and a companion have joined on a trip to a nearby country fair where they’ll try to profit by selling watered down citric acid as lemonade. Stavro, confronted by the two boys after displaying some amorous intentions in a hayloft one night, offers as explanation the story of his life, a history riveting in its brutality, joy, independence of spirit, and instinct for survival. Stories in Kyra Kyralina possess this kind of power: a capacity for bewitching and transforming the moment; in this instance the boys’ sense of insult regarding Stavro’s advances is quickly dissipated by the spell his tale creates." - http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2012/05/panait-istratis-kyra-kyralina.html[Seraillon]

*****
"Brazilian poet Ledo Ivo’s Snakes’ Nest is a “tale badly told” in a most artful manner. Part political allegory, the novel explores the nature of good and evil in a provincial port in northeastern Brazil during World War II––all the ills of the repressive dictatorship then in power are reflected in the corrupt and violent society of Maceió. As Ivo says: “During a dictatorship, all narratives are poorly told, since a dictatorship is the Kingdom of Lies and cannot tolerate the truth.” But to focus solely on the allegory would deny the richness of the book’s many layers, the considerable skill with which the characters emerge from the narrator’s false starts, the subtle and pervasive wit that skewers pomposity and pretension, the suspense created by the narrator’s very unreliability, and the poetry with which the exotic setting is evoked. The last word in describing such a heady mixture belongs to the author, who calls it, “a story of terror and violence that is, surely, a sunny nightmare.” Although Ledo Ivo is well known in his own country as a journalist and poetic spokesman of the “Generation of 1945,” this edition of Snakes’ Nest marks his first book-length appearance in English. Originally published in 1973 under the title Ninho de Cobras, Snakes’ Nest won the prestigious Brazilian Walmap Prize for that year. The novel has been translated by Kern Krapohl who, for several years, lived in Brazil and worked closely with the author. Jon M. Tolman of the University of New Mexico has contributed an informative introduction which clearly places the story both historically and geographically." - https://www.amazon.com/Snakes-Nest-Tale-Badly-Told/dp/0811208079/[Amazon]

[[Spurious]]
*Spurious* (2011)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Spurious-Novel-Lars-Iyer/dp/193555428X/[Amazon]

*****
If it weren't so funny, Spurious would be insanely depressing. W. and the novel's narrator, Lars, both know that, lacking the genius of Kafka, they will amount to nothing. They have been destroyed by literature; it has made them "vague and full of pathos." They are equally unskilled as philosophers. They would like to be intellectuals but they suffer from a deficiency of intellect. Drinking their way through Europe, they are overwhelmed by history that magnifies their own insignificance. A double suicide seems to be in order, but the logistics of accomplishing that task are beyond them. Yet even their deaths would be pointless because they are inconsequential parts of larger structure, easily replaced by others of no greater importance.

Paradoxically, the gloomy friends describe themselves as "joyful." They tell themselves that they are content with their idiocy. They are "celebrants of rivers"; a view of the sea from a passing train while holding cups full of gin is their definition of happiness. Contradiction is a constant in their lives; they never seem to be bothered by (or even to notice) their inconsistency. W. strives to puzzle out the meanings of primary sources written in languages he doesn't understand and to decipher mathematical concepts that are well beyond him. That he gains nothing productive from these efforts does not deter him; he is certain that his life will be spent in continual amazement at his utter lack of ability. Lars, on the other hand, is a capable administrator; he feels the need to earn a living, for which W. frequently belittles him. In fact, Lars is the constant recipient of W.'s insults (W. regards verbal abuse as "a sign of love"): Lars is (according to W.) obese, stupid, lazy, untalented, ill-mannered, incapable of love, and without any fashion sense.

The story careens between the philosophical and the frivolous (as when W. tries to persuade Lars that a "man bag" is preferable to a rucksack). One moment W. and Lars are discussing the relationship between God and mathematics, the next they're pondering the causes of the incurable dampness in Lars' flat or the merits of living in Canada, where residents presumably carry "bear-frightening devices" in their vehicles. There is a zany intelligence, an absurdist wit at work here (in that sense, Spurious reminded me of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead). Lars Iyer takes two characters who are lost in existential angst -- indifferent to their fates, deliberately living meaningless lives, convinced they are powerless to change the hopelessness and suffering that surrounds them -- and exposes their vapid, self-indulgent natures. Iyer's satirical take on intellectualism is spot on. Anyone acquainted with a "serious thinker" who takes his or her thinking too seriously will smile with recognition while reading Spurious.

At the same time, intermingled with the silliness are bits of genuine philosophy, deep thought disguised as idle chatter. The book demands a second reading just to sift out the sense from the nonsense, assuming it's possible to tell one from the other. As W. moans, he can never be sure whether he is "at the summit of his creativity or the peak of his idiocy."

This isn't a book for readers who can't abide stories that have no plot. This is a novel of comedic conversation, an examination of two friends who travel together, who gaze at the sea and mull over their lives, confess their shortcomings, debate the meaning of friendship, discuss obscure filmmakers, mourn or welcome (depending on their mood) the coming apocalypse, and accomplish nothing. If you can appreciate the humor in that, and don't mind that nothing of consequence happens to the two characters, you'll probably enjoy Spurious. It's fresh, it's original, it's insightful, and above all, it's hilarious. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPQSVQJV5OM8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193555428X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[TChris]

"A man in Hackney, east London, was recently dubbed the Mole Man for tunnelling under his neighbours' houses. Mick Jackson's real-life model for this novel, the fifth Duke of Portland, was a Mole Man born to the ermine (not inappropriately, you may think, as ermine like to burrow.) He created a sunken ballroom under his ducal seat. He insisted that his servants kept a chicken roasting at all hours of the day, and had it brought to him on heated wagons through underground passages. Jackson brilliantly ventriloquises his lordship in this novel, but the truth is unfathomably stranger than fiction." - http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/11/top-10-subterranean-books[Stephen Smith]
*****

*****
"The Penguin Books paperback from 1998 has what could be my favorite book cover of all time.It is, however, an approximate depiction of the story, and the story is a murky depiction of the real life character on which it was based, William John Cavendish-Bentink-Scott. Let the creative license begin.

Cavendish-Bentink-Scott, or the Duke, or your Grace, is introduced as an Emersonian, relate-able, sincere, a Romantic, and an old soul. Though not a religious one, a scientific one. He has author Mick Jackson's gifts of eloquence, to include strict observation of everybody's comings and goings and a deep empathy for Nature. He is sentimental and reflects poignantly on youth. This book had me sold early on, but I did wonder where it could be going.

The story meanders. His Grace slowly is seen to fall behind the times, to have a bond of friendship with people who are too distant to be his friends. His royalty always serves him regarding his whimsy but it spoils him for developing the depth of kinship he does very well to internalize in his journal entries and, sometimes, with the eccentrics he may meet. The story meanders, but the character whose mental restlessness pushes and twists that story keeps it alive. This also occurs because of the "what now?" anticipation that has to seek a resolution somewhere.

The tunnels are fascinating. The servants are uniquely tragicomic. The grounds and the residence are themselves a character. Eventually, the Edinburgh plot develops and sprouts a host of psychological options. You don't have to be crazy to appreciate the mortality in the tale. I just think you'd have to see yourself as a character flawed by age." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MYZ9XS7YDRB8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140274375[Cabin Dweller]

*****
"Widely considered a founder of French surrealism, Jacob (1876-1944) liked to combine seriousness with verbal clowning in his poetry. In the two children's tales contained in this volume, written in 1904 and 1923 but first published in 1971 in France, the emphasis is on the clowning. The eponymous story takes place in a faraway time and a fantasy place, and features a kitchen-boy who uses his culinary excellence to win the affections first of King Kabul, and then of his daughter. The humpbacked Toulic of "Vulcan's Crown" has a vision of Jesus that leads to a odyssey in which he flies on a fish's back and becomes the King of the Cheeses. Jacob's language is often mock-serious and delightfully ironic ("All the guards had been poisoned by a traitor disguised as a vendor of licorice-water"). The attention paid to the sensual particulars of cooking and the playfulness with language are very French, and the translation manages to convey this quality and to make the text both readable and contemporary ("She would marry none but a young man with job training"). Black-and-white line drawings accompany both tales, adding goofy-looking, bulbous-nosed cartoonish figures to the already bouncy text." - https://www.amazon.com/Gawain-Kitchen-French-Modernist-Library/dp/0803225776/[Amazon]

*****
THESE PAGES tempt the writer to be cleverly snide, ironic, or cynical about the books we present, and it's quite nice to find one you can be enthusiastic about.

Written by Mad Magazine's Frank Jacobs and published by Dial in 1965, this little book is a gentle spoof of the post-Victorian "boys' books" with resolute young heroes inventing or exploring (or both). Here, Our Hero travels the titular island with Dr. Thaddeus Cranshaw, searching for the Doubt.

Yes, it's a critter, and along with the Standing Ovation, the Running Commentary, and the Appropriate Gesture (this being Vernacular Island, remember) is part of the indigenous population, all wonderfully depicted by Edward Gorey, with nary a tennis shoe or fur coat to be seen.

Jacobs's delight in wordplay was one of the strongest characteristics of his work for Mad and is the best reason to spend a quiet hour with this little story. It's not the only one, though. Alvin Steadfast is filled with good-natured whimsy, gleefully conceived and described beasts (in addition to those listed above, we encounter the Glowing Report, the Small Wonder, and the Ill Omen), and a story elevated above the level of mere punning by Jacobs's obvious affection for the very material he lampoons here.

The story has all the necessary elements: a problem to be solved, difficulties met and conquered, characters driven by purpose and determination who win out against all odds, and even a Conditioned Reflex.

You'll have fun with this one, I promise you, and you'll have as much fun reading it to your kids. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2010/cur1005.htm[Bud Webster]

*****
This expensive scholarly volume contains one article which is of considerable interest even for the general reader. It's titled "The Supply of War Materials to Egypt in the Crusader Period".

The Middle East was largely deforested during the crusades, especially Egypt, the economic power-house of the Arab Muslim world. Yet, the Muslims built efficient war ships. Where did they acquire the wood? Iron was also in short supply, especially after the Muslim Fatimid dynasty in Egypt lost control of Sicily. Indeed, Muslim sword-making was of a relatively inferior quality. So where did the Muslims get their iron and their swords to fight the crusaders? Nor could Muslims enslave other Muslims, yet Egypt under the later Mamluk dynasty boasted a large slave-army. Where did the slaves come from? The mystery deepens when we realize that Muslims weren't free to go to Europe, which had both iron and forests.

It turns out that wood, iron and slaves were exported to Egypt by...Christian merchants!

Both Pisa, Genoa and Venice traded with Egypt on a massive scale both during and after the crusades. They brought timber and iron from Europe to Egypt, in return for oriental spices, alum (a mineral used in the Italian textile industry) and, of course, money (the Muslim rulers of Egypt usually paid market prices). Sometimes, they even sold actual ships to the Muslims. Ready-made swords from Christian Europe was another popular item. Many Muslim warriors brandished "crusader swords". The Christian kingdom of Cilician Armenia also traded with Egypt, with Italian merchants as middle-men. Here, wood was the prime commodity, since Asia Minor wasn't deforested.

Naturally, the popes and crusaders weren't amused, and attempted to curtail the trade in war material. Despite a number of bans, it continued unabated. Bizarrely, the Italian merchant-republics had extensive trading privileges in the Levantine crusader states. Often, ships with war material destined for Muslim Egypt made landfalls at Acre and other crusader ports! The crusaders were unable or unwilling to stop it. The Venetians and their Italianate competitors played a seemingly dangerous game, aiding the crusaders with ships at crucial junctures, while nevertheless providing their enemies with the means to fight them. Yet, it seems to have worked for centuries.

The Venetians, Pisans and Genoese managed to out-compete the Amalfitans (from Amalfi in southern Italy), who had dominated Christian-Egyptian trade before the crusades, even giving direct naval assistance to the Fatimids of Tunisia during their actual conquest of Egypt. (Before the crusades, it was the Byzantine Empire, constantly under Muslim attack, which attempted to impose an embargo on Egypt.) However, Amalfi kept aloof from the crusaders, which eventually undermined their position. The more galling Venetians, Pisans and Genoans successfully pretended to be on the right side while nevertheless making hefty profits at the crusaders' expense. The most extreme example is a certain Viviano de Ginnebaldo, a Venetian merchant stationed in Acre who traded with Egypt in war materials until the last moment in 1291, when the town fell to the Egyptian Mamluks. Ginnebaldo had to flee for his life to Cyprus, still under crusader control. There, he established himself at Famagusta *and resumed his trade with Egypt*.

Well, don't you just love the spirit of free enterprise!

Under the Mamluks, Italian merchants began to ship slaves from the Black Sea region to Egypt, where the peculiar "slave dynasty" of the Mamluks needed fresh new supplies of man-power for their armies. This, too, was made in face of papal prohibition. However, Jacoby says relatively little about this in his article. I suspect this trade became important only during the 14th century (after the crusades).

I'm sure the other articles in this collection are equally interesting, including one on Cretan cheese! However, I bought this book for one article only, the previously mentioned "The supply of war materials to Egypt in the crusader period". Some interesting information was also gleaned from "Byzantine trade with Egypt from the mid-tenth century to the Fourth Crusade".

Since I happen to be interested in the Ismailites, I admit that I have mixed feelings towards their conflicts with the Latins and Byzantines (the ruling Fatimid dynasty of Egypt was Ismailite). Saladin, the Mamluks or the Ottomans are something else again. I never liked Venice, either, so the revelation that the Serenissima traded for base profit with such scum of the earth as the Mamluks doesn't exactly come as a surprise.

We have met the enemy, and he is...one of ours. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R65WPN2WW1AM6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0860789802&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ashtar Command]

*****
In one passage of Negrophobia, the rotting corpse of Malcolm X (referred to as "the rotting corpse of Malcolm X")does the "Time Warp" from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and each occasion of "time warp" is replaced with "swine pork". This book is full of similar hilariously bloodthirsty satires. The humor is very offensive (to most races I can think of) and will have you either gasping in horror or rolling on the floor. The comedy value of this book is extraordinary, but there's much more to it as well: it is genuinely insightful, original and provoking when it comes to the philosophy and history of race relations in America. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XAVO5H4MNZQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312093500&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*The Five Jars* (1922)

*****
When Led Zepplin first sang mysteriously about an alarming "bustle in the hedgerow," we all assumed that they were overindulging in psychedelic drugs. But in retrospect, Page, Plant, and Co. could have been tripping on something much more dangerous: M. R. James's short novel, The Five Jars. If so, they were no doubt referencing the scene where the nameless narrator, a demure, bookish gentleman of leisure (a fellow much like James himself, a noted scholar and writer of ghost stories who lived from 1862 to 1936), takes a stroll in order to ponder how he can best protect his five magical jars, delivered to him by a talking brook through the agency of a unique plant which the brook has advised the narrator to swallow whole. At the proper moment, our hero hears "a squeak and a rustle" from a hedge, and, investigating, finds the exact potent horseshoe which an invisible race of sprites known as the Right People have advised him to look for. Or perhaps we are meant to recall the passage where every bird in the neighborhood assembles in the hedges around the narrator's cottage to save him from the machinations of a supernatural tramp.

From the foregoing partial account, you can well imagine that The Five Jars is a very odd tale. The narrator, his senses expanded by the ancient unguents contained in the five phials, experiences a Rimbaudian paradigm shift in his conception of reality. Yet like E. Nesbit, James simultaneously layers in so much homey British commonsense that along with the narrator, we can exclaim, "How prosaic!" even while ingesting proleptic plants.

As with George MacDonald's various "phantastes," James's only novel taps the same archetype-rich layers of consciousness that Freud or Jung "discovered," and remains mind-boggling even unto this day. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cur0001.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

This is a very great book, but I could hardly recommend it. Would you enjoy it? I think it is skies above the Ubu books in its range of vision, and I certainly didn't see any baboons with gluteal musculature grafted to their cheeks starring as commentator in those more famous works . . . well, I don't know what to say this "sort of thing" is exactly . . . if you are unfamiliar with this man (a drinker in the line of Rabelais, except I would say he was much more sincerely dedicated, a scholar, a scientist, a metaphysical swine, a bicycler, an eccentric above the heavyweights of French nincompoops, a novelist, -- also he did decent woodcuts, too) and his work then I would recommend the Supermale as a better beginning. If that is indeed your brand of entertainment, than hoist this flag up on the mast of your soft and sticky palm that never picked an axe to chop a block or made a fist to fight for your principles nor did anything else in all your life except to pick up another foreign book we can all be grateful for to have been translated, and sail it gently down the seas of your eyes until you land where you were looking for . . . this is a traveler's book. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXYXLUNUO9VR9/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1878972073[Bill Given]

"This book is over 200 years old and still popular. There's a good reason for that.

It captures all that people love about slapstick, and doesn't worry about toning it down for the kids. The two heros drift from town to town, bordello to bordello, and bar to bar. They're petty grifters, always trying to pull another meager scam, and always getting the worst of it in the end.

There's no real plot here, just a sequence of vignettes. They're all like enough in kind to create a rhythm, but different enough to stay entertaining. Lots of the humor is low - potty humor, not restricted just to human waste. As in some britcoms, our heroes suddenly appear in their underwear time and again - or out of it, or next to it, or looking up into a tree at it. The real fun is in their silly pranks and exaggerations, always found out in ways that make them look like total twits.

Ikku Jippensha's work is still a good read, even today. Sometimes, though, English doesn't capture the flavor of the original. The translator just shouldn't have bothered with some of the puns, and a few turns of phrase probably sounded better back when this was translated. End-notes are scanty, and there appears to be a systematic error in page number references towards the end of the notes.

None of that really interferes with a good read. Enjoy the prat-falls as much as the original readers did, 200 years ago and in Japan." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LM95633VUOF5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005M2AHYA[wiredweird]

*****
"B.S. Johnson is known for his boundary pushing novels and "Albert Angelo" is one of them. Telling the story of an aspiring architect (or is he?) who substitute teaches for a living, "Albert Angelo" breaks the "fourth wall", presents internal monologues side by side with narrative action, switches narrative perspective, and even works in other non-traditional modes of storytelling. The end result is an engaging, always compelling, at times quite funny portrait of a man who is, in many ways, not to be liked.

While Johnson's unconventional forms can be accused of being gimmicky, "Albert Angelo" works because of the way the story and character is presented. Albert Angelo is not a likable man, yet because the specifics of his character faults are revealed in the uniquely parsed way that they are, the reader is not turned off. The only part of the story that does not work and seems forced (and out of nowhere) is the ending, in which Johnson admits that he is a novelist and writing a novel and thus he can do anything. Johnson already proves that through action in the book and the open admittance at the end is unnecessary.
Regardless, "Albert Angelo" is well-worth the time." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HB5ZY0MME46C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MQIPG99[PuroShaggy]

"BS Johnson is one of those experimental writers, controversial during their lives that subsequently vanishes from print. Johnson was a journalist, a socialist, and a fine novelist. Best known for The Unfortunates (his book in a box where every chapter is separately bound and the reader is invited to read them in any order he or she wishes), Christie Malry's Own Double Entry is perhaps his most accessible novel.

However, this "accessibility" is in the midst of a studiedly experimental text. This is a corruscating satire in which Johnson targets one of the symbols of capitalism, the double entry system. The very basis of accountancy, and the manipulation of finance, Johnson turns this building block on its head as his central character, Christie Malry, a young man with a future, decides that he will live his life accoridng to the principles of double entry.

Johnson's novel has acute observations on a variety of issues in British life that still merit comment. How working class people come to vote conservative, the manner in which people's worth is measured financially; and all of this is in the midst of an angry satire where Malry wreaks vengeance on the system. It is a bitter cycnical novel, with a dark wit.

There is love, sex, and death; and an unusual use for shaving foam. And all of this is presented in a slightly distant way, where Johnson continually turns to the reader and winks, letting you know this is a novel. Characters are aware of their place in fiction, and Johnson deconstructs the novel to let you see how it works.

This description may be off putting, but this is classy fiction. It is funny, and angry. I enjoyed this work, but preferred Johnson's The Unfortunates; which I feel has more depth, and more humanity.

If you enjoyed this you may like Graham Greene's Dr Fischer of Geneva or The Bomb Party or Michael Dibdin's Dirty Tricks (a Thatcherite satire). - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AMC59H0LPHN9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811209547[Amazon Customer]

"David Jones served in the ranks of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and survived two years service on the Western Front. These experiences form the inspiration for his magnum opus. Written for those men with whom he served, Jones's poem follows a section of Fusiliers in their first six months in the line, culminating in the 38th Welsh Division's attack at Mametz Wood in the second week of the Somme Offensive. Jones imbues his poetry with his literary and cultural influences - invoking the Welsh bards Aneirin and Taliesin, and the tales of Arthur and of Roland, and the long forgotten memories of the Roman legions. This, some have said, tends to make light of the events portrayed, glorifying war, but not so, for Jones isn't in the business of belittling the struggle and death of these men, rather as he says at the beginning he is remembering what he saw and felt. Jones is very much harkening back to an older bardic tradition, manifested in particular by his careful emulation of older poetic traditions, namely that of medieval Wales and France. Though grounded in the cold hard reality of the Western Front, Jones words speak of an older more ancient time; his Fusiliers are no mere victims of a foolish general's blunder - there isn't much of the "lions led by donkeys" myth perpetuated here - but soldiers forced into the heat of battle, who seek to hug the earth but arise to commit themselves to an attack nonetheless. Quite powerful.
If a layman seeks an inkling of understanding of the trenches then this is most certainly the work for it. This is not a memoir, but a lyrical masterpiece of verse and prose, too often overlooked. This is the English language molded and manipulated to charm the senses so as to instill a small appreciation of the reality. It is a song of warriors, composed by one who survived." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32HCOCFC0RO23/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2QW0G0[Lord Clare]

"One of the best epic poems of the last century. No, one of the best epic poems ever. A speculum into the collective psyche. How myths of our making go to shape us for such things as the unimaginable carnage of the first world war. How everything we label 'civilisation' is founded on very thin ice, and how horrible are the things that lurk beneath. Phantasmagoric and, at the same time, true. Which is perfect for our age.

*****
The high bonnet of Idwal Jones's book, published in 1945 and now reprinted by the Modern Library Food series, is the chef's toque, a symbol of his stature, of cooking itself. Achieving the high bonnet is the good fortune of the novel's Jean-Marie Gallois, a young confisseur (candy maker) from Provence who has earned an apprenticeship at Paris's famed Faisen d'Or restaurant. But Jean-Marie's ascension to glory is not the novel's central concern; revealing a world entirely devoted to food--getting it, eating it, and discussing it--is. In prose as sensually provocative as the dishes his characters enjoy, Jones acquaints readers with a world dedicated to pursuing pleasure at the table and the craft that makes it, in its culinary dimension at least, most possible. The joy and art of High Bonnet is that its readers instantly ally themselves with the characters--with their mania for dining high, low, and outrageous (on the perfect Potage Crécy and prehistoric muskox, for example). It's an exciting feat.

Early in the book, we meet the Baroness, who eats "with eyes half drooped, like a pigeon's in flight, allowing [a] croustade to splinter under her excellent teeth." Jones's splendid creation is also responsible for sending Jean-Marie to his apprenticeship, and thus to our encountering a Vietnamese anarchist; Guido, the roguish Italian kitchen expediter; a dwarf rôtissuer; an alcoholic waiter; a saffron-stashing sauce master, and many more extraordinary characters. Meals are enjoyed and stories are told, like that of a man "ruined by a dish," the creator of a legendary curry recipe who falls disastrously from great heights when he can no longer obtain the dish's "secret" ingredient. A philosophy is also put before us: "Never expect a perfect dinner to come from a clean kitchen," says a character; "as well as expect one from a laboratory." In our own age of mass cooking, it's particularly alluring to follow the adventures of Jean-Marie and company. High Bonnet is a window on a lost world and human activity that today cries for the book's vital passion. - http://www.amazon.com/High-Bonnet-Epicurean-Adventures-Library/dp/0375757562/[Arthur Boehm]

*****
This is a first rate collection of sf from Langdon Jones, former literary editor of New Worlds, composer, and a very unjustly-neglected writer.

The stories range from fairly conventional ("The Great Clock") to the frankly experimental ("The Eye of the Lens"). The prose is elegant, forceful, and unfailingly eloquent. Many of the stories employ non-linear narrative techniques, but the work is always under control, and even at its most puzzling makes compelling reading.

Two stories stand out for me: "Symphony No. 6 in C Minor 'The Tragic' by Ludwig van Beethoven II" is a comic story about a less-than-great-composer who suffered from being named after the REAL Beethoven. It is slyly humorous, and if you have ever read about the lives of composers during the Romantic Period, or simply read a lot of old liner-notes on Classical recordings, it'll have you laughing.

"The Garden of Delights" is a masterful story which combines Eros, Thanatos, and Time Travel into a poignant combination that will cause you to ponder the implications for some time after. In my estimation, it stands with stories of the period from Harrison, Ballard, and Aldiss as among the best short work to come out of the New Wave.

Although the book is not large, I definitely thought it delivered the goods, and I believe it's worth your time.

There is also an interesting introduction by the author. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R88XOFZRHJEC7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=086130022X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[L. Stearns Newburg]

The best look at life as a man and the best description of (necessary?) madness ever put in print, there's simply nothing like this book, nothing nowhere, nohow. R.F. Jones wrote a 'lost' masterpiece back in the 70s and I am SO glad to see it back in print. I can start giving it to the weak and the strong again, it's good for what ails all of 'em. This saga of a man and his son's journey up the Hassayampa river, complete with exotic mixed grill, tourist traps and deadfalls, madness, mau-maus and Ratnose qualifies as a defining point in Mens Fiction of the latter 20th century. Let me repeat that, this is fiction for Men. No one get their politically correct undies in a wad, that was just a fair warning, the last you'll get around here. Anybody whining after that was said, Ratnose throws to the dogs. The point is, you're on your own up the Hassayampa, and that's a big hint. Come on along, anybody interested, you'll figure out whether you need something you ain't got soon enough. The bunch of yez, load your pockets with ammo and jerky, check the knife in your boot and start steppin'. See what's waiting for you up the river. Something different waiting for everyone, a vision quest that will end or it won't, maybe just a new assessment of your foodchain pecking order. The Hassayampa giveth and it taketh away. You'll see what I mean, just look at the flotsam floating by, mastadons and marlin, atlatls and motorbikes. You're checking your backtrail? Then you're as ready as you'll ever be. What're you waiting on? The water's just fine.

[[Metropole]]
*Metropole* (2008)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Metropole-Ferenc-Karinthy/dp/1846590345/[Amazon]

*****
Ferenc Karinthy (1921-1992), a trained linguist, was the son of famed Hungarian writer playwright Frigyes Karinthy. Not surprisingly, then, the complexity and confusion of language is the central theme of Karinthy's 1970 novel "Metropole" (originally entitled "Epépé"), the Kafkaesque tale of a hapless narrator stranded on the top floor of the figurative Tower of Babel.

The plot builds upon a basic but very ironic premise: Budai, a linguist, seems to have boarded the wrong plane on his way to a conference in Helsinki and has now ended up in a mysterious city in an unknown country with a singularly incomprehensible language. It is packed to overflowing: human congestion spills from the lobbies out into the streets and Budai is rudely rushed down sidewalks and through lines. Even the solitude of the hotel room he manages to acquire is afflicted by the alien alphabet he encounters in a framed printout presumably of hotel regulations. The overwhelming effect is one of claustrophobia reinforced by a rambling syntax that pushes headlong from page to page in lengthy paragraphs. A harried Budai roams from place to place in time with the narrative rhythm, attempting unsuccessfully to find . . . a way . . . out . . . OF . . . HERE! The very density of the urban dreamscape - its unyielding masses of humanity and mazes of streets, alleys, passageways, myriads of neighborhoods - seems to compress into a solid wall, entrapping Budai as effectively as any stone-and-mortar fortification. The mounting tension is palpable, even as it superficially plateaus when Budai settles into his hotel room, finds some work, and even acquires a sort of girlfriend. Obviously such fragile comfort cannot possibly last: it must prelude some catastrophe, which, when it comes, seems naturally inevitable as the expected fate of a stranger in a wholly strange land.

Yet strangely enough, however, Budai's demeanor throughout his ordeal is not one of panic or outright desperation; on the contrast, he is more perturbed than anything else. He is similar in that respect to many of Kafka's protagonists, particularly Gregor Samsa the giant bug, as an individual whose reaction to a grotesque or extraordinary situation is one of bemusement or annoyance rather than shock or terror. This lends a greater element of realism to "Metropole" that might have been otherwise submerged in emotional bombast. "Metropole" is frightening because it comes across as a probable scenario - not because it is a horror novel in the Stephen King or Dean Koontz sense of the term. In fact, it reminded me, oddly enough, of "Johnny Got His Gun," as a tale of a man locked in a nightmarish scenario and desperate make himself understood. What "Metropole" also does quite effectively is to unearth the subliminal fears of anonymity and invisibility in contemporary society. Indeed, it is a story of individuality and subjectivity taken to their greatest extreme: if each citizen of "Metropole" is actually uttering a verbal articulation of their own private language, as Budai comes to suspect, then maybe the driving force behind modern isolation is precisely this teeming urban obscurity, in addition to Western culture's emphasis on personal independence, personal ambition, personal expression, personal gratification, ad infinitum. If Budai is jarringly cool about his predicament, then perhaps that is because his situation is merely a farcical extension of the realities of modern life.

Despite its relatively unknown status in the United States, "Metropole" is actually considered a modern classic. Its unspecified setting and multilingual protagonist contribute to a greater international, cross-cultural appeal, especially as the nameless city is described as both a wanly generic and strikingly diverse place that any reader anywhere can envision for themselves. The bizarre nature of the story is itself an attraction, since one cannot help but wonder where all this could possibly lead to. "Metropole," therefore, comes highly recommended. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X8Y2NCN1VFZZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846590345&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E. L. Fay]

*****
Published four years after "Ninteen Eighty-Four", "One" seems to tread over similar ground, depicting the plight of an individual against a dystopian, collectivist state. However, Karp's future society is far more similar to ours than Orwell's Stalinist nightmare and the "thought crimes" are more nebulous. As a result, some readers have dismissed "One" as a derivative, watered-down version of"Nineteen Eighty-Four". In my opinion, that is a mistake.

Whether David Karp was or wasn't familiar with Orwell's masterpiece, "One" succeeds on its own terms and in some ways, Karp's superficially benign state is far more chilling than the histrionics of Big Brother.

Quite why this gripping, thoughtful and well-written novel has been neglected for so long is a mystery. I'm really glad to see that it has been reprinted and I only hope that "Leave Me Alone" - a wonderful novel that has echoes of "Revolutionary Road" and "Mad Men" - will also come back into print. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXEAGLZF87ZS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140014594&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Captain Pike]

*****
If it is possible that the name Steve Katz doesn’t push your buttons, then a bit of bio may help: ‘Steve Katz (born May 1935) is an American writer. He is considered an early post-modern or avant-garde writer for works such as The Exaggerations of Peter Prince (1968), and Saw (1972). His collection of stories, Creamy & Delicious (1970), was mentioned in Larry McCaffery's list of the 100 greatest books of the 20th century where it was named "The most extreme and perfectly executed fictional work to emerge from the Pop Art scene of the late 60s." Thanks to Wikipedia for that.

From other sources honoring the creative mind of Katz, the following is garnered: Steve Katz saw the great legends of cool and be-bop jazz play in the New York of the 1950s; encountered Nabokov, Pynchon, and others at Cornell; roomed in the Chelsea and met Joplin, Warhol, Ashbery, Plimpton, Vonnegut, Serra, Glass, and countless artists and scenesters in 1960s and 70s New York; bummed his way to Italy to view a painting by Masaccio; traveled West, to hallucinogenic high plains film-sets, Beat Rocky Mountain poetry enclaves, and North, where avant-gardists hiked into Canadian maritime wilderness and set up thirty-eight-foot high teepees in which to do the work that would later show up in Manhattan. World traveler and Tai Chi teacher, husband and then ex- of a cookbook author, and father of three sons, Katz in his magisterial assortment never fails to evoke a passion for the arts, spanning and telescoping centuries and far-flung worlds in words of wonder. This beneficent account of a life spent among artists, writers and musicians from the American 60's through the 90's - by a writer of bracing fiction--is a testament to its own qualities. I, reading, remembered 'the day' and could see clearly now, without dolor or fever, what it was all about. Steve Katz has always served it straight."

Now refreshed (or introduced), open this treasure trove of very brief (1 – 3 pages each) of Katz’ reflections on encounters, impact of the cultural world gone mad, overheard conversations, and more. Steve Katz's 137-episode memoir is a shuffled life story, a vagabond autobiography, its episodes wandering around the world, around the arts, in and through 80 years of varied experiences. There is a very brief conversation between William Burroughs and Tennessee Williams that captures the essence of both slightly off center writers, a drug purchase in Jerusalem gone wrong, an episode of failing as a fire lookout and an encounter with a Jaguar that bears quoting: ‘the thrill of gratitude when someone you love tells you she has worried about you is very great. I remember that, but even more I remember the smooch of a Jaguar’s tongue. Many of us enjoy how the first kiss of the person we know we will marry lingers as a palimpsest on the lips. Or some remember what it feels like after a fight, the first time they get smashed on the face. So does the sensation of the Jaguar licking across my sleeping eyes remain embedded in my skin as if memory.’ His writing is contagious – just read through ‘South Corn Street’ and relive the pungent 60s better than anyone has expressed them. Steve Katz is an American genius and here is a chance to see why. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RZZ8XCMXBUEFA/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938603052&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Grady Harp]

*****
"As someone who was a professional film programmer for many years, when 35mm was still prevalent (though on its last gasp, sadly), I have a special appreciation for this book, which combines a gloriously geeky, impressively encyclopedic grasp of cinema history along with the high-minded literary sensibility of Frederick Exley and John Kennedy Toole. In fact, I'd place this contemporary classic in the same celebrated category as Walker Percy's "The Moviegoer" in terms of its unabashed love of the form. But none of these comparisons do it justice or adequately communicate just how richly evocative this book is, due to the unique voice of its author. It's a long-winded but effortless read, a dual crash course in human nature and popular culture, with delirious detours through the dirty details of not only this dying industry, but of dozens of films, both obscure and popular, weaving a variety of colors into its complex narrative fabric. This is one of those books that you can just pick up and read at random, like "The Catcher in the Rye" or Ezekiel Tyrus's "Eli, Ely," because the characters are so vividly drawn and the dialogue is so cleverly authentic that it's like you're visiting or old friends or eavesdropping on an entertaining bar conversation. But you'll want to read every word from beginning to end on the first pass, otherwise you'll miss countless bits of priceless prose and witty asides and filmic lore." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNWZCGMW89ZF5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940885272[Will Viharo]

*The Box from Japan* (1932)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Box-Japan-Harry-Stephen-Keeler-ebook/dp/B0032FPXD4/[Amazon]

*****
If I'm not mistaken this is the longest single-volume mystery ever published in the US... 73 chapters and 407 double-column pages in this edition. Written in 1932 it takes place in 1942 Chicago, where Carr Halsey, a newspaper sports columnist, and his sidekick, reporter Artemus Baxter, tackle a many-faceted mystery which ultimately boils down to who killed a chemist named Proctor, and why, and what happened to a seemingly completely vanished stock shareholder that two rival interests are hotly searching for. As in most Keeler novels there is virtually no action, except for a gunbattle at the country estate of a spy, and a wild taxi ride at high speed through crowded Chicago streets to reach the missing shareholder before a rival representative does.

The reader will find many strange things about the richly detailed future that is the real subject of the novel. For one thing, much more than a decade seems to have passed since 1932... perhaps Keeler originally intended the novel to be set in 1952 or 1962 and he or his publisher got cold feet at such a long time jump.

How can you not like a novel with plot that turns on a Mexican economy based on sugar produced by genetically engineered cacti? A system for theatrical projection of live overseas 3D color TV broadcasts? A method of making a powerful explosive from sugar. A Japanese emperor whose plan to neutralize the British fleet and conquer Australia would probably have worked despite the new Nicaraguan Canal. A communication method involving a tight plasma beam set up high in the atmosphere between transmitter and receiver. A man trying to conceal his role as a traitor during the Russo-Japanese war; and a secret society devoted to hunting him down! An unbreakable code based on a Mexican High School physics textbook. A method for temporarily increasing the strength of steel by more than a factor of 2. And much, much, much more.

Keeler was a trained engineer and the "future" techology about which the characters lecture one another in often overwhelming detail is not always preposterous. There is also a great deal of social and political satire. As usual in a Keeler novel, the "mystery" of who killed the chemist and why is "solved" only on the last page, when essential background information that was never available to the reader during the course of the story has been suddenly trotted out.

If you love the works of Harry Stephen Keeler, this is a novel not to be missed... written before his literary efforts deteriorated into complete unreadability, but still full of the total craziness that is essentially Keeler.

The computer-scanned text has a number of computer-generated misprints, but many fewer than usual in books reproduced in such a way. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0BUELOFFR0N/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032FPXD4&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text[Rory Coker]

*****
"DAVID H. Keller (1880-1966) was a neuropsychiatrist who served active duty in both World Wars. He wrote fiction and semi-autobiographical tales for his own amusement before becoming one of the pioneer American science fiction writers with his first "Kelleryarn," "The Revolt of the Pedestrians" (Amazing Stories, February 1928). Arguably the only Gernsback writer not to have to clamor for payment, Keller generated more than a hundred tales of all lengths as well as medical texts and marriage/sex manuals luridly sold in the back pages of many a pulp magazine.

It may never be known if Keller's claim that The Devil and the Doctor (published by Simon & Schuster, no less!) was pulled from bookshelves for its taboo presentation of a sympathetic portrayal of Old Hob (or a villainous Jehovah!) is true. The Devil here, one Robin Goodfellow, visits Jacob Hubler, a folksy semi-retired country doctor enjoying a sedentary life of book-collecting and compulsively planning the construction of a stone fence for his dream house.

Hubler's friendship with the charming Goodfellow results in his achieving this, along with the addition of a new young wife! Jealous and suspicious neighbors begin to question the source of Hubler's recent happiness. It also appears that Goodfellow's brother objects to the doctor's newfound success and Hubler finds himself the target of Heavenly dispatches. I'll leave it for the reader to learn how Dr. Hubler fares in this battle. Icing on the cake: like the Herb Roese artwork for the novels of Thorne Smith, the illustrations by Gregor Duncan are perfectly suited for this nifty charmer." - Stephen Haffner

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Scorpions-Robert-Kelly/dp/1886449201/[Amazon]

*****
This novel belongs on the shelf right next to Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49. Although in my opinion it is the product of a more pure and directed vision than Pynchon's now-canonized work, and a less shallowly ego-maniacal enterprise than any of Delillo's comparable fictional essays on American twentieth century paranoia and power. Kelly takes up satirically (but in a serious way, this satire is as serious as Petronius) just about every major literary and cinematic trope from the decades after the second World War, at least all the ones to do with white masculinity--the road novel (and film), the psychiatrist-as-priest-of-culture, the rebel without a cause, the endurance of fascism in American culture and the hilariously overwrought anxiety it provoked, the elevation of total erotic self-expression to the level of cure-all (shades of Wilhelm Reich, for sure), and indeed the "difficult" modernist novel itself, with all the self-conscious interleaving of texts and diagetic levels, the refusal of the power of narration to remain unconscious and, in fact, its perennial aggressive insistence on making itself known not just as a factor of an author's personal narcissism (which is, of course, partly the case in Woolf and Faulkner and Joyce and Mann, and much more so with Nabokov) but as a now-canonical rhetoric feature of Literary Writing, which had become as exciting and vulgar as any of the old cliches from, say, crime fiction. The Scorpions is the perfect expression of the transformation of literary modernism from avant-garde to kitsch, and is working from some of the same destructive energy as animates Andy Warhol's best work. It is, in short, a very loony book indeed. None of Kelly's poetry that I've read comes even close to it. Read it; it will dazzle and delight, and you will not want to put it down. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBYCBA3A7FWB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1886449201&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Joshua T.

*****
"This little treasure from 1945 is still fresh today with its well spun yarns of the peculiar and the strange. Reading this slim volume is like sitting down with a stranger and hearing one odd yard after another: it's a story-telling fest with intimate detail and surreal suggestion. Tale-spinning shop owners, shipwrecked circus freaks, a young murderess, racial implications and early surgery techniques.

It's witty, charming, morbid at times, freakish, and most certainly eye-opening. I read the entire book in less than a day; I couldn't get enough of the tale-telling. The author writes, "Here is food for thought, but I do not like the thought it feeds." Some of the tales will make you uncomfortable, but squirming in your easy chair while sipping that comforting cocoa is part of the charm of the book.

My favorite was The Queen Of Pig Island, a classic tale of shipwrecked circus freaks and how they survived ... and then interacted. The Sympathetic Souse has a little surprise at the end, The Crewel Needle finds horror in an unlikely source, followed by ruin. I loved Prophet Without Honor not just for the unusual aspect but for the yarn itself. There isn't one bad tale in this book. It's also surprising how forward thinking Mr. Kersh was, exploring events that hadn't happened yet and turning out fairly accurate in today's world (though with that edgy twist).

My copy was old and frail, and I found myself handling the book like a newborn, careful and gentle, while just wanting to bury myself into it and absorb all the good qualities, not unlike blowing on a baby's belly.

The blurbs on the back of the book use such words as 'provocative', 'titillating', 'enthralling', 'brilliant', 'wildly funny', and 'sinister'. All these proclamations hold true, this is really a book that is not to be missed by any fan of Horror, SciFi, or Fantasy. My word to describe 'On An Odd Note' would be 'absorbing'. It's a book you won't be able to put down. Enjoy!" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ELE1PH406TK6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939140099[Schtinky]

*****
This collection of 37 stories by a master of the form features tales that are sometimes funny, sometimes violent, and sometimes weird and nightmarish: in short, it is quintessential Gerald Kersh. Kersh (1911-1968) published more than thirty books, including the noir classic Night and the City (1938) and Fowlers End (1957), which Anthony Burgess called "one of the great comic novels of the century," as well as hundreds of short stories which were once ubiquitous in British and American magazines. But though he has been championed by Angela Carter, Harlan Ellison, Ian Fleming, Michael Moorcock and others, Kersh has undeservedly fallen into neglect since his death. This is the first-ever reprint of Neither Man Nor Dog (1946), one of the author's scarcest volumes.

Kersh's novels Fowlers End and The Great Wash and the short story collections Nightshade and Damnations, On an Odd Note, and Clock Without Hands are also available from Valancourt. - http://www.amazon.com/Neither-Valancourt-20th-Century-Classics/dp/1941147720/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
"Called one of the great comic novels of the 20th century, Fowler's End is a hilarious book which proved to be a challenge to read. One of the difficulties in reading the novel is that it's written in dialect, never an easy task. The book even has a glossary of Cockney rhyming slang at the beginning. For instance, "bucket-and-pail" is a way to say "jail". It also comes with a lengthy introduction by Michael Moorcock.

Fowler's End is a first person account of Daniel Laverock's brief tenure as the manager of a decrepit movie theater in London. It's the year 1929 and sound is just coming in. But the owner, Sam Yudenow, is convinced sound film is a passing fad. There's also a business associate of Yudenow, Copper Baldwin, who's trying to keep the whole operation afloat. Finally, Laverock and Baldwin, hit upon a scheme to enrich themselves and pull one over on Yudenow at the same time.

There is a lot more to the novel than the above description. The first 25 pages are written in one long monologue by Yudenow about running the theater. Complicating the tirade is the way he talks: a strange mixture of Yiddish and cockney:

“This way it’s simple. Like this, all you got to do is show ’em in. Let ’em dress, let ’em make up to their ’eart’s content—there’s a looking glass in every room, and in the yard a lovely laventry. Comes five minutes before the hour nip out o’ the ’all an’ get ’em out. Then all they got to do is nip dahnstairs, nip into the front entrance, nip through my vestibule, nip up the back o’ the ’all an’ wait. This you should synchronize to the tick miv the end o’ the second feature, which naturally comes on first..."

The book focuses on the utter wretchedness of the inhabitants of Fowler's End. There are plenty of stories about the filth people take for granted on a daily basis. One of the characters gets idea to treat spoiled meat with copper sulfate and sell it as "greenburgers". The theater musicians are one step removed from homeless. Even the piano player is a hopeless drunk. The only employers in the slum produce glue,pipes and sulfuric acid. But Kersh has a way with words which make it all hilarious.

For instance, this discussion of a Victorian dirty profession known as a "pure finder":

“Pure, son, is dog’s dung. It’s best ’and-picked, and in the better quarters o’ the town, or round the posh kennels.”

“What do they use it for? Growing flowers?” I asked.

“Gawd, no! Pure is death to flowers. But it’s the only thing you can possibly treat Russia leather with. Dog’s dung and no other dung’s got some chemical principle in it that makes Russia leather supple and fragrant. The best sort was worth a few pence a pound, and it ’ad to be picked by ’and so you knew what you was getting. None o’ your biscuit-fed pure would do, nor your bone-eating pure. The real meat-fed stuff with body in it. . . .".

Gerald Kersh was a popular writer who lived from 1911- 68. Years ago, I found a paperback edition of his short fiction, Nightshades and Daminations, which impressed me to no end. His novel Night and the City was twice made into a movie. Once again, bonus points to Valancourt for a bringing a hard-to-find novel back into print."  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A7B13PLXOQ3C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193914048X[Timothy L Mayer]

*****
Picture a tall, thin man with blazing light blue eyes parading down the main pedestrian boulevard in a city wearing a tweed suit, Sherlock Holmes double-brimmed hat and smoking a curved ivory Sherlock Holmes pipe, putting himself on display as if he were a perfectly balanced combination of Oscar Wilde and that famous London detective. And, as the crowning moment of his performance, the tall, thin man halts in the middle of a gaping crowd of onlookers and theatrically lies down in the middle of the sidewalk, and then, after several minutes, nonchalantly rises to his feet and continues his stroll. Quite a sight; quite a man. Are we among artists in gay-Paris in 1868 or among Greenwich Village hippies in 1968? No, indeed, we are not -- we are in a totalitarian state, more specifically, we are in 1931 Stalinist Russia. Meet our one-of-a-kind author, Daniil Kharms. Considering the communist ideal of every healthy man and women seeing themselves as a productive, hard-working citizen of the state, taking their place elbow to elbow with their comrades in the field or the factory, it is something of a miracle Daniil Kharms's short life (the state locked him in a mental institution at age 38 where he died of starvation) wasn't even shorter.

So, how, you may ask, does this one-of-a-kind writer tell a story? Before making more general comments on several stories and plays, here is a story entitled `Events' in its entirety:

------ One day Orlov stuffed himself with mashed peas and died. Krylov, having heard the news, also died. And Spiridonov died regardless. And Spiridonov's wife fell from the cupboard and also died. And the Spiridonov children drowned in a pond. Spiridonov's grandmother took to the bottle and wandered the highways. And Mikhailov stopped combing his hair and came down with mange. And Kruglov sketched a lady holding a whip and went mad. And Perekhryostov received four hundred rubles wired over the telegraph and was so uppity about it that he was forced to leave his job.
All good people but they don't know how to hold their ground.

Quite a story in the tradition of great Russian literature: multiple deaths, a case of alcoholism, disease, madness, forced unemployment. And, of course, some moral philosophy thrown in at the end. Of course, I'm being ironic, but only partially. This is vintage Kharms, a literary vision and expression that is nothing less than piercing. After all, how should an artist and poet create when living in a society that is cruel, oppressive and repressive? Write conventional, familiar narrative? It is as if those penetrating light blue eyes of Kharms could see through all the pretense, sham, invention, deceit, and façade in both life and art and he would have none of it.

This collection contains well over one hundred pieces, mostly one-page stories, but also some poems and micro-plays along with several longer works, including a twenty-two page tale involving an old woman mysteriously sitting in the narrator's favorite armchair. There is a one-page story of a fight where a man mutilates his opponent's face and nose with his dentures, another one-pager about a man who not only loses his handkerchief, hat, jacket and boots but also himself, another one-pager where an artist goes to a canal to buy rubber so he can make a rubber band to stretch but meanwhile an old woman gets burned up in a stove, and still another one pager where an engineer builds a wall across all of Petersburg but never knows what the wall is good for. There is a one page play where Pushkin and Gogol do nothing but repeatedly trip and fall over one another and another play where a single actor takes the stage only to vomit and is followed by three more solo appearances of vomiting actors followed by a little girl who tells the audience to go home since all the actors are sick. Weird? Absolutely. Bizarre, strange, outlandish, crazy, nutty, kooky, wild? Again, yes, absolutely.

There is an excellent twenty-five page introduction by Matvei Yankelevich giving the reader new to Daniil Kharms the cultural and literary context as well as biographical information of the author. Anything more than this introduction might be too much since the uniqueness of Kharms demands (and I don't think demands is too strong a word here) freshness. Rather than reading Kharms and being reminded of Kafka, Sartre, Camus, Beckett or Dada, keep it fresh - read Kharms and read Kharms slowly and carefully, as if you were reading literature for the first time. Be open for miracles. And you will witness miracles, lots of them. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R28WG1N56G80OQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159020042X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810115735[Amazon]

*****
The key to understanding this book, I think, lies in starting with the subtitle: "Russia's Literature of the Absurd." Kharms and Vvedensky are pen names of Russian/Soviet writers who are known in their home country for their children's books. This is because their more serious and creative writings did not agree with the Stalinist conception of proper art. Hence it was almost impossible for them to publish what they wanted. The editor George Gibian compiled in this volume the stories of Kharms and Vvedensky that have been preserved by their friends or simply lovers of literature. Some of my favorites in this volume are "Cashier" and "Power." I also enjoyed Kharms' poem about melancholy, which is printed in English in the Introduction and in its original Russian at the end of the book.

All stories are short, many less than a page long. They can finally take their proper place among important works of Russian literature. I cannot say that I was captivated or dazzled by this book, but it has interesting moments that will be appreciated by anyone interested in Russian literature or the literature of the absurd. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E1441EIIHFC3/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810115735[unraveler]

When the great Finnish modernist genius Volter Kilpi died in the summer of 1939 at the age of 64, he left behind an unfinished novel manuscript about Lemuel Gulliver’s fifth voyage—this one supposedly to the North Pole, though along the way the ship is sucked into a vortex near the Pole and hurtled two centuries ahead in time. He and three surviving shipmates end up in London in 1938, wondering how to get back to their time. In addition to translating what Kilpi wrote into Swiftian English, Douglas Robinson has here written the incomplete novel to the end, based on Kilpi’s report to his son on how he planned to return the men to 1738. Because Kilpi also playfully pretended to have “found” the original English manuscript, presumably written by Lemuel Gulliver himself, and “translated” it into Finnish, Robinson goes along with that pretense and pretends to have rediscovered and “edited” and “annotated” the original English manuscript—written, perhaps, not by Gulliver but (at least partly) by Jonathan Swift. The addition of Robinson’s English translation of Volter Kilpi’s “translator’s preface” and two fictional constructs—anonymous “random notes toward a vorticist manifesto” (1914) and an ersatz “reader’s report” by an imaginary Finnish Kilpi scholar named Julius Nyrkki—transforms the entire volume into a postmodern “critical edition” that would have tickled Volter Kilpi pink. - https://www.amazon.com/Gullivers-Voyage-Phantomimia-Volter-KILPI/dp/6066971220/[Amazon]

Alas, poor Kingsmill, we hardly knew thee. Hugh Kingsmill is one of those delightful, witty writers that the British turned out in embarrassed abundance during the middle of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, except among such enlightened connoisseurs as Michael Holroyd, Kingsmill is completely forgotten today. And he shouldn't be! This book is a good brief in Kingsmill's defense.

Frank Harris was a literary con artist who, amazingly enough, dominated Shakespearean criticism in the early 20th Century. Kingsmill was initially one of his acolytes until he saw through the old fraud. And so, we have this delightfully malevolent biography of the "Rake of Modern Letters." Here's a sample (which was also the subject of a famous Max Beerbohm caricature):

The lunch began, and Harris and the Duke were soon in friendly talk, when suddenly Harris's deep voice sounded above the general conversation.

'No, my dear Duke, I know nothing of the joys of homosexuality. You must speak to my friend Oscar about that.'

A profound silence descended upon the room.

'And yet,' Harris mused, in more subdued but still reverberating tones, 'if Shakespeare had asked me, I would have had to submit.'

Truly, truly awful. Go get this book! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAM6RELOZD9B/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571255043&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Patrick Odaniel]

Kis, Danilo (1935-1990)

[[Tomb_for_Boris_Davidovich]]
*Tomb for Boris Davidovich* (2001)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564782735/[Amazon]

*****
Danilo Kis was born in Serbia in 1935 to a Hungarian Jewish father and Montenegrin Serbian mother. His father perished in the Holocaust. Kis died of cancer in 1990 at age 55. As noted in an excellent introduction by the writer, poet and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Brodsky, publication of A Tomb for Boris Davidovich in Yugoslavia in 1976 created a firestorm in Belgrade similar to the controversies that flared up when Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was published in the USSR during Khrushchev's thaw. The book was savaged by the Yugoslav writer's union. As Brodsky notes in one memorable line, "there are several topics an author may deal with which can jeopardize his well-being, and history is one of them". The controversy, standing alone, may justify reading Tomb for Boris Davidovich. I am pleased to report that these stories are so well-constructed and laden with meaning that it would be worth reading even if its publication had been greeted with equanimity by the apparatchiks that manned the Yugoslav writers' union.

The seven stories that comprise Danilo Kis' A Tomb for Boris Davidovich have a few elements in common. Each involves a protagonist from a different country, Ireland, Hungary, Rumania, Poland, or Russia. In effect, each protagonist comes from a nation or a group that participated in the Comintern (the Soviet led Third International that coordinated the worldwide activities of various Communist organizations established by Lenin in 1919). Each gets swept up in the machinations that swirled around the Soviet Union's Great Terror of the 1930s. Each ends up either dead or in the Gulag.

With one exception each of the stories takes places in the 1930s. The one exception, "Dogs and Books" is set in 14th-century France at the time of the inquisition. Although that story seems out of place, when one compares the structure and fact-pattern of this story to the title story of the book one can only be struck by the obvious similarities between the methods and mind-set of the inquisitors and the methods and mind-sets of the interrogator in the story Tomb for Boris Davidovich.

The title story is also jarring because it contains many of the same themes set out in Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon. In the context of a short story, the brevity and terseness of Kis' language makes the telling of the story considerably more powerful in some respects than Koestler's novel length telling of a similar tale. Even if a reader feels that Kis' story does not quite match Koestler's, the fact that the comparison can be made with a straight face is high praise.

Last, Tomb for Boris Davidovich should be of great interest to anyone interested in the work of the great Argentine writer, Jorge Luis Borges. The structure and theme of Tomb for Boris Davidovich was intended by Kis to be part of a literary polemic between Kis and Borges, specifically concerning the title of Borge's Universal History of Infamy. Kis discusses this literary exchange in one of his essays. In it he asserted that the universal infamies related by Borges were those of gangsters, pirates and highwaymen. Kis argues that as far as infamy was concerned, "infamy is when in the name of the idea of a better world for which whole generations have perished, in the name of a humanistic idea, you build camps and destroy both people and their most intimate drams of a better world."

In many respects, Tomb for Boris Davidovich may be considered as an exquisitely crafted attempt to construct a literary monument to those who died (perhaps naively and foolishly) and for whom bells never rang and for whom the widows have long since stopped weeping. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIEJUE0ARC7X/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564782735&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lonya]

"On one level, this is an obvious, and very funny
play off of Kafka's Metamorphosis. Instead of a
guy waking up and finding out that he's turned
into a roach, a roach wakes up and finds that
he's become a guy. It's a perfect set-up for a
gag: what kind of a guy does a roach turn into?
Your cousin Louie? Dick Cheyney? Michael Moore?

It should be no surprise that he goes first in to
organized crime, then legitimate business, then politics.
Readers will no doubt assign various contemporary
political figures to the roles laid out in the book-
that's part of the fun, but by no means the whole story.

It would have been tempting for the author-who may
or may not be named `Tyler Knox'-to play this story
strictly for laughs. But Knox is better than that.
What he does is create a combination of the pure
naturalism of John McFee, the noirish vision of
Raymond Chandler and the wiseacre perspective of
Damon Runyon.

Does that sound like a set-up for a parody? It's not.
Instead, it's a book that is so seductive that you'll
find yourself reading it long after your eyes have
started to droop. It's a book whose narrator-the Kockroach's
mite- will stay with you for days after
the read is done.

For fans of complex fiction, this is a gem. The
narrator is a subordinate character who's more
interesting that the `roach of the title. But his
fascination stems from his relationship to the
roach-turned-man. His negotiations of the terms
of that relationship and his unreliable narration
are what gives this book its exceptional power.

Unlike most fiction that relies on a device like
Kockroach's, this novel stayed with me for a long
time. Brilliant might be too big a word for this,
but not by much." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W49B0KPZBT5L/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ULTKZU[Lynn Hoffman]

"Pavel Kohout's White Book is an elegantly written chronicle of the absurd, the story of Adam Jur0ek. a teacher of physical education and drawing in a Bohemian spa, who becomes the first person to break the law of gravity by rising gently in his own dwelling and planting his feet firmly on the ceiling. Comrade Juracek's private levitation becomes public. challenging the work of Comrade Isaac Newton and bringing down on himself the outraged and outrageous reactions of the state and the guardians of psychiatric dogma.

Pavel Kohout has constructed an elaborate satire. documenting Adam Juracek's adventures from the imaginary future of the 21st century. There is a "springtime" of high hopes when all the young people are on his side-a pamphlet issued on Juracek's behalf recalls those May days in 1968 when the youth of Prague were conjuring up the memory of the Reformation martyr, Jan Hus. Then the government declares a national emergency, and Juracek is tried and turned over to a succession of psychiatrists, all of whom he baffles-all, that is, but one. He emerges in the year 2000, following a United Nations amnesty, knowing only his identification number and reciting Newton's formula." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807608610/[Amazon]

*The Dissertation* (1989)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Dissertation-Novel-Norton-paperback-fiction/dp/0393306488/[Amazon]

*****
Koster conjures up a Latin American nation with larger than life heroes - and villains - whose lives (and the central character has many "lives") can and will transmogrify at the whims of nature and fate.

The story is told in the form of a PhD dissertation (addressed to Drs. Lillywhite and Grimes of Sunburst University in a mythical place called Florida) and parodies the academic form and format hilariously.

The "text" is a Grand Epic history of the Central American nation of Tinieblas and his family's place in it's story. The "footnotes" expose not only the fevered candidate's unconventional method of collecting original sources (he interviews many of the makers of his nation's history from their current homes in the afterlife) but reveals his slow emotional unraveling into a less-than-delicate madness driven by the stresses and excesses of the academic life.

"The Dissertation" is a Llossa, Marquez or Allende tale told in episodes recalled after (either)

- guzzling a pitcher of martinis,

- dropping acid, or

- gulping helium.

But in addition to a finely tuned sense of the absurd, Koster writes a dead-on-the-level adventure tale.

The episode in which he sends central character, Leon Fuertes, through the WWII battle of Monte Cassino is every bit as gripping a story as any James Jones might have written.

This cult classic deserves wider reading. It's as much fun to read as "My Search for Warren G. Harding," "A Confederacy of Dunces," or the "Flashman" adventures from the fertile mind of George MacDonald Fraser - and especially recommended for fans of Latin American fiction who feel that the conventions of the genre could use a satirical tweak or two, or anyone who has experienced the innate absurdities that too frequently accompany the pursuit of a graduate degree.

Buy it. Read it. Send a letter to Bob Koster about how much you enjoyed it.
Maybe he'll write us another one this good. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUFOZILY1QOR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393306488&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*****
"I cannot praise this book too highly. For a story in which hardly anything happens, it is full of surprises, starting with the title, which is misleading in two ways: the book ignores Skylark for most of its length (although it is surely all about her in a sense), and she is the antithesis of a skylark. But the biggest surprise is the power of the narrative. I admit that I began to wonder about midway why I was still reading the book since, as I say, nothing seemed to be happening. But in the book's latter part the sheer depth of feelings began to become paramount, and the purpose of it all became clearer and clearer, culminating in a drama that was almost unbearable.

The book is amazing also for its gentleness despite great emotional turmoil, for that turmoil arising from the everyday, for its balancing of the stripping away of all pretense with the purest love, and for its ordinary yet devastating finale. I suppose different readers will take away different things from this book, some even seeing a vindication of the title. But for this reader it seems almost absurd that I should be commending the book to anyone, since -- aside from the joy of reading good writing -- it has left me with a reaffirmation of life's awfulness. But I am used to the idea that there is at least this kind of consolation to be had from life: that from its awfulness sometimes comes great art.

By the way, one nice little touch (among many): I believe one of the minor characters must represent the author, who inserts himself in a clever, even droll, way." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RG2W59RS88K9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590173392[Joel Marks]

http://www.amazon.com/Satantango-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3-Krasznahorkai/dp/0811220893/[Amazon]

*****
I'll start by confessing that I have written on Krasznahorkai for years and on the basis of The Melancholy of Resistance and his other books, I consider him one of the greatest contemporary writers.

Satantango was Krasznahorkai's first novel, published in 1985 but only translated now into English. I've read Satantango in French but I don't know Hungarian, so I can only say that Szirtes seems to have done as wonderful a job here as he did with Melancholy.

Satantango is the story of a tiny rural Hungarian village and its miserable, static inhabitants. A drunk doctor, a barman, farmers, and a few others have affairs and go about their lives. A certain tragedy strikes, and simultaneously a (very) false prophet named Irimias appears to play havoc in the tragedy's aftermath. It is a simple story, made complex by a precise, nightmarish build-up of small, unsettling details and destabilizing loops of prose that makes you feel like the very basis of reality is falling apart, reflecting the condition of the villagers.

The prose is thick and miasmic, though not as labyrinthine as Krasznahorkai's subsequent work. There is more acute cruelty in this book, in contrast to the sublime chaos that takes over in Melancholy of Resistance. Here is the doctor sitting by his window, watching the others:

"He had had to amass and arrange, in the most serviceable positions possible, the objects indispensable for eating, drinking, smoking, diary-writing, reading and countless other trifling tasks, and even had to renounce allowing the occasional error to go unpunished out of self-indulgence pure and simple."

Those who have a great affection for other voices of chaos and fracture, like Kleist and Kafka and Beckett, should read Krasznahorkai. I would rank him among them. His long sentences get compared to Thomas Bernhard, but Krasznahorkai is much more metaphysical, much less psychological. (Only Bernhard's Correction bears any real resemblance to Krasznahorkai's work.)

The fantastic Hungarian director Bela Tarr filmed Satantango (it's 7 1/2 hours long): I would recommend reading the book first, however, because the film adaptation makes excisions and alterations that are better appreciated with knowledge of the book. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q07VV0KDM1KP/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811220893&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[David Auerbach]

"I first 'met' the author of this text in 1984, when one of my colleagues sent me a hadnwritten 'Ode to Stalin' that had turned up in a book at one of the Librarries of my University. This short poem (21 lines long) was written in classical Greek, and had obviously been written by someone who was steeped in the text and dialect of the epic poet Homer. At that time I wrote to my colleague, the late professor George Thaniel, that this was a veritable tour de force; after all, not many of us are capable of composing poetry in ancient Greek, let alone poetry that sounds as thought it might have been written by the founder of western literature! In due course, Professor Thaniel published a brief article on the poe, including the text, in the Athenian periodical Tó Trám for October 1989. In it, he disclosed that the poem had been written as long ago as 1948, and that the author bore the name of Jan Křesadlo.

Now Jan Křesadlo has returned to the fray. But this time he has extended his horizons. This time he has written us an epic poem in 24 books (just like Homer's epics), over 6500 lines in all. This time, once again, he has written something that is appropriate to the age in which we live - a science-fiction story about a cosmic voyage ... The author is obviously very familiar with the language of Homer. ... it is an exciting story, well told, and generally intelligible, if you are moderately familiar with Homer. Read on, and enjoy yourself. We must all express our admiration and thanks to Jan Křesadlo." - https://www.amazon.com/Astronautilia-Hv%C3%ACzdoplavba-Jan-Kresadlo/dp/8023724525/[Wallace McLeod]

*****
"This novella (112 pages: approximately 30,000 words) is, at its simplest, a brief and much more recent equivalent of The Canterbury Tales. A group of men meet on successive Saturday evenings to tell widely-varying stories of their own invention. There is a certain amount of tension between the storytellers and some of the stories have elements of bawdiness (in this case, much milder than Chaucer’s).

The Club’s name relates to its founding principle that nothing should be written down (the tale-telling is purely oral). A thought or conception, in its quest for creative life, must separate itself from the written word. Writers are ‘professional word tamers’. A bookcase full of pinned-down words spells the end of the imagination. The seven Club members – Zez, Das, Tyd, Hig, Mov, Fev and Rar – call themselves not writers or readers but conceivers. All have adopted names consisting of a vowel surrounded by two consonants that in combination have no meaning.

Are you still with me? When I write that a novel, or in this case novella, is ‘of ideas’, I do so quite as much as a warning to the unwary as an enticement for those who like that sort of thing.

Besides its framing story, the book contains five more-or-less self-contained pieces of writing. The first is a playlet derived from Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Guildenstern (of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) becomes two people, Guilden and Stern; Ophelia: Phelia and Phelya; and Hamlet I (white cloak) and Hamlet II (black cloak) take turns to speak the famous soliloquy: ‘To be?’; ‘Or not to be?’; etc. It works surprisingly well!

The more conventional stories are a priestly tale set in mediaeval France; a dystopian science fiction story in which scientists separate the brain’s directives from the body’s motor functions; a tale in which three friends set out to determine which of the mouth’s three functions, talking, kissing and eating, is the more important; and a Roman story in which a slave girl, left alone with the body of her recently dead master, takes the coin that, in accordance with the custom of the time, has been placed in his mouth. He is thus unable to pay Charon for his passage across the Styx. The story has alternative endings; an interesting twist.

Looking for meanings in the individual stories and in the novella as a whole could occupy years of study. The temptation to factor-in Krzhizhanovsky’s situation as a Soviet writer should not be resisted, but what to make of it? Virtually all the fiction that he presented to the censor in his lifetime was rejected, but he was kept busy with writing screenplays and a libretto, and proof-reading the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia, was not subjected to persecution, and in 1939 was admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers. Born in 1887 and active as a writer for two decades from about 1920, he lived to 1950. Most publication of his work stems from 1976, when a trove of his work preserved by his life partner, Anna Bovshek, an actress, was rediscovered." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LS2TEITYEJVI/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EH38VW[Lost John]

*****
"This is a collection of short stories written by surely the most difficult to spell author of all-time, Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky. Writing under the Soviet regime in the early part of last century, most of his work didn't get past the censors and remained unpublished until the period of Glasnost in the late '80s. The stories are quirky and imaginative, sometimes fantastical, usually satirical, and often witty; and there are common themes of individual and social identity, reality and abstraction, life and death, space and time. Some of the stories are quite clearly political, concerning the submergence and alienation of the individual under Soviet rule - soul seepage, as he terms it. There is a good deal of word-play in the stories, so the excellent translation by Joanne Turnbull and Nikolai Formozov is essential to letting the reader grasp the author's intention.

Like most collections, this one is variable - some of the stories are interesting and enjoyable, while in others Krzhizhanovsky lets his philosophising tendencies run away with him, making them overly wordy while not being quite as profound he presumably intended them to be. However, none of them are less than thought-provoking and they give an insight into the difficulties of plain-speaking in a time of censorship and worse.

There are 11 stories in the collection, plus a short introduction by Adam Thirlwell, giving brief biographical details of the author. There are fairly extensive notes at the back, and in some of the stories these are quite important as the people and institutions the author refers to are often no longer household names - at least, not in my household.

The title story sets the scene for much of what is to follow - through the letters of a man written in the three consecutive nights before committing suicide, Krzhizhanovsky introduces his main subject of identity as an individual within, or more often outside, society. The next story takes us straight to the fantastical as a man becomes fascinated by his own image reflected back to him from the eye of his lover - until one day the reflection disappears. We are told the story of this 'little man' who finds he has fallen into a space in the lover's head where the 'little men' of all her former lovers are gathered, telling each other the story of their relationship with her. Humorous and quirky, but still with the theme of identity at the fore, we begin to get a feel for how Krzhizhanovsky uses the fantastic as a vehicle for philosophising and satire. This shows through strongly in another story, The Unbitten Elbow, where the author takes a sharply ironic look at politics, celebrity, the media and most of all the tendency of philosophers to try to read meaning into the meaningless - which is in itself ironic, since I felt Krzhizhanovsky wasn't immune from falling into that trap himself.

Overall I enjoyed most of the stories enough that they made up for the over-stuffed ones. I think my favourite is 'Yellow Coal' - a satire based on the idea that sources of energy are running out and, in response to a competition, an inventor suggests powering things with human spite - bile, known as yellow coal. This works amazingly well as supplies are inexhaustible, until gradually everyone becomes contented and well-fed... Unfortunately the last story, Postmark: Moscow, was the most incomprehensible to me, since it relied to some extent on the reader getting references to the ideas of many philosophers who were no more than names to me, if that. But even so, it rounded off the recurring theme throughout the book of 'I's and 'Not's - the alienation of the individual and the disconnect from society. A thought-provoking collection where the best of the stories are highly entertaining and the worst are still quite readable - recommended." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J4WDUQLDYX4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGHRDUU[FictionFan]

"Although there was an actual flesh-and-blood Baron Munchausen (1720-1797) and a popular highly fictionalized account of his adventures wrestling a forty-foot crocodile, traveling to the moon, riding a cannonball and numerous other equally wacky happenings penned by a man who probably attended the Baron’s dinner parties, one Rudolf Erich Raspe, millions of people around the globe know this swashbuckling hero from Terry Gilliam’s 1988 over-the-top feature film The Adventures of Baron Munchausen with a cast including John Neville, Eric Idle and Uma Thurman. And in her informative introduction to this NYRB edition, Joanne Turnbull provides insight and context on how in Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky’s novella the Baron springs to life yet again, this time the year 1921 in London and travels incognito cross county to Soviet Moscow. Ready or not, comrades, here he comes!

Who better than a poet to be the first to meet and speak with Munchausen on the very first page in Chapter One? Exactly the case - the poet Unding arrives at the Baron’s apartment in London and is treated to a number of revelations, including the Baron opening his prize book, a small gilt-edged octavo with leather corner pieces, to his usual abode between page sixty-eight and sixty-nine: “Unding looked: on the bent-back page between parted paragraphs were the fine black rules of an oblong box: but inside the box was only the blank stare of white space – the illustration had disappeared.” I am quite certain you are familiar with how a character in a book can come to life – well there you have it, our author taking metaphor to new outrageous levels more than seventy years prior to Terry Gilliam’s film. Actually, every single paragraph in Sigizmund's short novel would require an enormous budget and some mighty special special effects if made into a blockbuster movie.

Shifting focus to the novella’s language itself, readers will be both delighted and charmed, as for example, here is our audacious Munchausen, in the author’s own words, confronting a highly original chess problem: “Confounded chessboard,” a frightened Munchausen whispers, then sees in the middle of the square, on an enormous round leg, its black varnished mane bristling: a chess knight. Without wasting a moment, he jumps onto the horse’s high neck; the horse twitches its wooden ears, and Munchausen, gripping the slippery varnish with his knees, feels the one-legged chessman crouch down, then jump forward, again forward and sideways, once more forward, forward and sideways; the ground now falls away, now strikes the horse’s found heel with its swinging steeples and roofs; but the felt-shod heel-Munchausen remembers this well-gallops furiously on: squares flicker past, then patchwork fields and checkerboard cities-more and more-forward, forward, sideways and forward; the round heel pounds now grass, now stone, now black earth.” Turns out this sequence is a dream sequence but, dream or no dream, the confabulations are continuous and fabulous chapter after chapter.

Moving right along to The Devil in a Droshky, a chapter comprising a large chunk of the book, Munchausen presents a lecture with slideshow of his Russian escapades to a packed house in a London auditorium. Here is my synopsis of one such escapade but please keep in mind the difference between the author’s words and my words is, as the saying goes, the difference between chicken soup and running a chicken with goulashes on through water. Anyway, the Baron relates how years ago he lost his favorite hunting hound and, rather than getting a new dog, trained his hunting boots to fetch. He would walk thought the woods, gun over his shoulder and when game needed fetching he would take off his boots, point them in the right direction and say, “Seek! Seek!” So it went again in Russia but this time a group of Soviet villagers notice the boots coming toward them, scream with horror and run away in all directions. The Baron reflects in such a country of superstitious know-nothings he could conquer all of Russia in his bare feet. But then a sequence of unforeseen interactions with these empty-headed villagers requires a Munchausen-style change of plans. You will have to read for yourself to discover exactly what outlandishness transpires.

This multidimensional classic can be read not only as a rollicking adventure but also surreal parable, fantastic metafiction, uncanny philosophic inquiry into the nature of language and reality or razor-sharp satire pointed mostly at Lenin and Soviet Russia. Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky described himself as being "known for being unknown.” It is now 2017 and, above all else, it’s time for this outstanding author to be better known. The Return of Munchausen is a great way to start." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P1JW694KEUYN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=168137028X[Glenn Russell]

One senses that this indulgent and dazzling exercise in ferocious derangement and, arguably, allegory, must read less awkwardly in the original German. You will not read this for its literary style, which is clumsy at times, but for its pure, rarefied, winningly repulsive air of pre-War Euro-decadence, for its uncanny presentiments of the coming horrors of the 20th century, and for its profligate richness of bizarre imagery. The book is fuel for dreams of the weirdest kind. This is appropriate, because in it Kubin seeks to portray a "Dream Realm" -- very far from the one Morpheus rules over in The Sandman -- created at the whim of a ludicrously wealthy and myserious aristocrat. This Dream Realm, aka the city of Pearl, is situated in Asia, but represents, among other things, a vision of pre-industrial Europe stagnating, suppurating, and sinking into its indolent self -- but at least avoiding the horrors of modernization and liberalism! With a wink, then (the book is quite funny in a scabrous way), Kubin deals with such issues as race, the media, psychoanalysis, religion (gnosticism in particular), death, and sexuality. He does so inconclusively, but with unflagging inventiveness, and a real eye for the startling mental picture and the horrific detail. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29FCL30P51VTA/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1873982690[matthew martens]

Kundera, Milan

[[The_Joke]]
*The Joke* (1967)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Joke-Definitive-Version-Milan-Kundera/dp/006099505X/[Amazon]

*****
There's a disagreeable air of (for lack of a better term) "nihilism" pervading Kundera's _The Joke_. (And I've read it in the original Czech 1st edition of 1967, not in any of the many skewed foreign-language translations habitually deplored by Kundera.) To state it clearly: my own vision of human life and this world couldn't be more different from Kundera's. His is a thoroughly despairing vision. There are many "first person narrators" in _The Joke_, but there is little doubt that the cynical and disillusioned and utterly faithless "lost soul" Ludvík is the writer's alter ego (at least, how the 30-something Milan Kundera used to be around the mid-1960s). Naturally, taking into account the nightmare experiences of many years that the fictional character of Ludvík had to go through, it would be unfair to take issue with his bleak vision of the world. Readers may disagree with such a vision -- but Ludvík (and by extension, Milan Kundera) is fully entitled to it, no matter how "wrong" or, more precisely, *one-sided* it may appear to some readers.

And so, _The Joke_ is an outstanding book, a classic -- with reservations (due to the one-sidedness and lack of perspective mentioned above), but a definite classic nevertheless. For me, this is mainly due to the book's *political dimension*. There have been, and there still are countless deluded people in Western Europe and/or the US, with no practical experience of life in a Stalinist/Communist regime, who are enthusiastic about extreme-left political ideals. _The Joke_ should be required reading for them all. The regime (it continued, in its milder form, into the late 1980s all around Central-Eastern and Eastern Europe) was perverse and cruel, and _The Joke_ is superb in putting a spotlight on its heinousness.

Kundera himself as a person or citizen is not blameless (but who is?). He rejects the most recent accusations from a few years ago of having denounced a suspicious person to the Communist authorities in the early 1950s. But that is immaterial. The main difference between Kundera and his leading character Ludvík Jahn is that Kundera used to be very much a pro-regime artist in the bleakest Stalinist times. Hats off to him for having laudably changed his positions so radically later on in life (culminating in his fleeing Communist Czechoslovakia for France) -- but a privileged Kundera in the early 1950s was someone completely different. In this sense, _The Joke_ is also a harsh (albeit indirect) piece of *self-criticism*; we get to see how indescribably inane used to be many people (particularly young people) in having deluded themselves, throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, that the Communist regime would be capable of *forcibly* installing a better society for everyone, while mercilessly, brutally crushing all its opponents. As mentioned above, a variation of that same self-delusion continues to be very much alive among some Western "intellectuals" to this day, the advancing 21st century.

Indeed, if there is one persistent motif, theme, or as if (to borrow a musical term -- and _The Joke_ is full of musical allusions and explorations of musicologist subjects, particularly relating to Moravian folk songs) an underlying bass line in the book, then this main motif of _The Joke_ is: *self-delusion* (in Czech, "sebeklam"). No one is sillier and more contemptible, yet at the same time more pitiable in _The Joke_, than the weak-minded, politically and romantically extremely naive but at the same time ruthless (towards a philandering younger colleague of hers) radio reporter Helena, the intended "object" of Ludvík's misfired "joke". Yet Ludvík himself used to be extremely self-deluded as well, in the late 1940s and early 1950s (the years of the onset of Stalinism in Czechoslovakia) -- in fact, you might say Ludvík continues to be self-deluded *to this day*; naturally, in *quite a different way* nowadays: in a "modern", "intellectual" way, by succumbing to pessimism/nihilism without reservations. Another absurdly self-deluded character in _The Joke_ is Jaroslav, living out his own (failed) dreams through his hapless, disinterested teenage son, enforcing folk festivities on him as *his* (the father's!) only true joy and fulfillment in life. Yet another supremely self-deluded person in _The Joke_ is Kostka: the religious person fatuously believing that religious faith and the Communist regime can somehow be reconciled.

And so, there is a disagreeable nihilism in the book, a general sense of emptiness pervading that world; it is only the convincing portrayal of Stalinist (particularly moral) depredation that raises _The Joke_ to the level of noteworthy literature; the *political* dimension of _The Joke_ is its strongest and most important one. And I say that as someone who *dislikes* political dimensions of books -- yet it is irresistible here in Kundera's _The Joke_. There is a give-away sign or remark towards the very end of _The Joke_, when the Ludvík narrator refers to "bodily (!) love" as "the most elementary value (of human life)". Well, there you have it in a nutshell, Kundera's world view: it's not the *spiritual* aspects of life that matter to him the most -- it's the *bodily* aspects he apparently considers to be the most important in life. Is it any wonder, then, that characters with such a world view can only end up being miserable, succumbing to a thoroughly bleak vision of human life and the world?

I said "the Ludvík narrator", because there are *many* various "first-person narrators" in _The Joke_. The constantly changing perspectives (changing ever faster as the book moves along, and changing the fastest in the book's breathtaking finale in the last chapter) are refreshing and enjoyable to read. It's a nice form of experimentation with the form of the novel. I particularly liked that Kundera gave a distinctly separate voice to each of the "first-person narrators" in terms of the *syntax and punctuation* they use. Ludvík, the most "intellectual" from among the characters, uses advanced syntax and punctuation in his narration; the harebrained/hypocritical/lecherous/banal Helena, the simplest. To put it unkindly, you could say that _The Joke_ presents *lots of blockheads* in first-person narration -- not excepting the allegedly superior (in terms of his intellect) Ludvík. It's a pantheon of all the fools who used to put their faith in Stalinism; I suppose the recollection of this fact is so mortifying to Kundera that that is one of the reasons why he keeps insisting, today, that he is "a French writer", not a Czech writer; he must have lived through countless (if not bodily, then certainly mental or psychological) nightmares in his home country if he, nowadays, feels such a pressing need to distance himself from his own past and his own original home country so much. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUASNQNF0EGWM/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006099505X[Faterson]

*****
"The kind of exercise in post-modernity that makes traditionalists drop their monocles in disbelief at the self-indulgence of it all, A Concussed History of Scotland earned Kuppner huge critical acclaim but, perhaps understandably, didn’t trouble any bestseller lists. Splitting the fragmented ramblings of an unidentified consciousness into 500 chapters, a maelstrom of name and place, date and time that would have James Joyce blushing at its obtuseness, this novel loves to play with readers’ expectations, poking and prodding them into action with a big metaphysical stick.

That it straddles the line between surrealism and the avant garde without ever leaving the reader too detached reveals Kuppner to be an extremely funny writer, although he often hides it well under a blizzard of abrasive aphorisms and sceptical insight underpinned by a vicious intellect which drove him to ask if Scotland is ‘small enough’. And all this in a book that could probably be enjoyed by rolling a dice to decide which chapter to read next without any discernible loss in sense, yet criticised by some as too articulate or for its lack of orientating centre or ‘key’ to a greater universal truth.

Not particularly Scottish in outlook or language, but still unmistakably of this nation in its preoccupations, Kuppner’s career has seen him mining a vein of Scottish fiction vastly different from the bestsellers of Kennedy, Rankin or Welsh. For while he has been compared most often to Alasdair Gray, his work actually stands closest to the Pulitzer-winning prose-poet Charles Simic, whose Yugoslav-American compositions revolve around the impossibility of meaning and empathy and the lack found in all language.

A great Scottish writer then, because he doesn’t limit himself to the country’s literary tradition, instead demonstrating an intimidating verbal dexterity which draws also on European and Asian influences, Kuppner is this nation’s one-man new wave." - https://www.list.co.uk/article/2744-frank-kuppner-a-concussed-history-of-scotland-1990/[Dave Martin]

"The Scottish poet and writer Frank Kuppner is not afraid of bold experiments, but these are leavened with strong writing and a deft sense of humour. He has written a variety of books of poetry for Carcanet, who really do publish some first rate stuff.

To my knowledge his first book of Poetry was Bad Day for the Sung Dynasty with a fine cover by Alasdair Gray. It was a collection of 501 four line poems elegantly spoofing ancient China. This book returns to the theme.

It is impossible not to compare the books, but seeing as a Bad Day for the Sung Dynasty is out of print, it is pretty much irrelevant.

If you have read a Bad Day for the Sung Dynasty you will love this, it is slightly broader in scope, though admirably restrained. Kuppner never takes an easy joke at the expense of the credibility of his world. This is an ancient China of the imagination, all crooked bridges and wistful concubines.

If you have not read a Bad Day for the Sung Dynasty then you will still love this. Accessible and thoughtful, one to savour.

Worth noting that this imprint is on poorer stock paper and a little crammed compared to the earlier book, there are also a few typos later on, which is odd in such a short book. However I cannot recommend this book too highly, if you like Borges, Calvino, Gray, Sladek, then you will find much to enjoy here." - https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R274PNZEGG10V7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1857543106[tallmanbaby]

"There's nothing like kicking a great writer when he's down. TS Eliot, villain of stage, screen and literary criticism, is now a popular football for his fellow poets. Tom Paulin let his prose attacks spill into The Invasion Handbook, and even Geoffrey Hill, the most Eliotic of contemporary poets, has been using verse and prose to bad-mouth Four Quartets. However, when it comes to Eliot-bashing, Frank Kuppner makes the competition look like pussycats.

Though he may not have Paulin's fame or Hill's reputation, Kuppner has been one of the most interesting Scottish writers of the past 20 years. The spoof Chinese-in-translation of his first book of verse, A Bad Day for the Sung Dynasty, like the later Second Best Moments in Chinese History, was novel, funny and often rather beautiful. In a very different manner, the prose of A Quiet Street and Something Very Like Murder spliced investigation into old crimes with autobiographical reminiscence to create what approached a new genre. Other books have varied in style from the fanciful and the manically comic to the meditative and argumentative; the titles of Kuppner's volumes Ridiculous! Absurd! Disgusting! and Everything is Strange indicate much of what is captivating and, sometimes, wearying about his varied oeuvre.

A God's Breakfast is three books in one. The first and longest is "The Uninvited Guest", a sequence of hundreds of cod-classical epigrams and fragments; the third, "What Else is There?" a collection of 120 shorter poems. The rest of the volume is given up to "West Åland, or Five Tombeaux for Mr Testoil". At 48 pages, "West Åland" is about as long as The Waste Land and Four Quartets combined and is, I'd reckon, the most protracted dance ever made by one poet upon the grave of another.

In it Eliot's verse is mercilessly caricatured, his faith and thought denounced, and his private life lampooned. While charges that Eliot was a right-wing Christian, had a bad first marriage and was an editor at Faber and Faber are scarcely news, the contention that Eliot wasn't much of a poet comes as more of a surprise. To help persuade us, Kuppner scrawls ruderies on Eliot's lines ("I grow stout ... I grow stout / I shall walk through St Paul's with my balls hanging out", and so on) and tries to convince us that Eliot wrote doggerel and rhetorical waffle by supplying his own.

...

There is something to offend almost everyone, including a fair amount that is sexist or homophobic, but there's also plenty to illuminate, amuse and instruct. Kuppner likes the role of Diogenes the Cynic: shameless and funny, pointing out his own animal nature and the foolishness and hypocrisy of others. However, it's Karl Popper, the philosopher of science and vehement critic of Plato, who is the guiding genius of this attempt to enter the disputes of the ancient world in order to address the misconceptions of the present.

Kuppner's desire to hammer home old arguments can knock his own art out of shape, and his work tends to be best when it has the least design upon us. In "The Uninvited Guest", however, Kuppner's ideas are at their most interesting and attractive. All of the gripes of "West Åland" - against spurious profundity and obscurantism, against religion, anti-materialism and asceticism - are here. Nevertheless, set free of the grudge against Eliot and placed amid competing voices, they, and the reader, are given space to breathe." - https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview16[William Wootten]

"That Frank Kuppner is not widely recognised as one of the most ingenious contemporary Scottish writers is a disgrace. From his surreal short stories (In The Beginning There Was Physics) to his haunting memoirs that combine investigations into true crime with meditations on personal loss (Something Very Like Murder and A Very Quiet Street) to his utterly idiosyncratic poetry – only Kuppner could call his selected poems What? Again? – he has consistently tested the limits of literary forms, literary tastes and literary norms.

Kuppner published a wonderful poem called 'First Lines Of Leo Hennigsdorfer' in Poetry Scotland several years ago. This new collection expands the conceit: the Great Poetic Anthology has been lost in cyberspace, but its index has turned up in a Latin American restaurant in Glasgow. The entire collection is first lines of lost poems: some ribald, some melancholy, some silly, some profound. 

Kuppner has huge fun in this collection. Each line glimmers with possibilities, and simultaneously frustrates them all. There are, of course, parodies (having ruthlessly skewered TS Eliot in his previous collection, he seems to have it in for Gerard Manley Hopkins now, with lines such as "Wafer all-conquering, eclipsed biscuit, yea, Christ's crisp disc, whilk") and gleefully childish rewrites of great lines to include rude words. You can dip into it, but it rewards sustained reading.

There are little eddies, where the same line is repeated with variations, or corruptions, or emendations. The overall effect, especially when coupled with Kuppner's testy distrust of religious ideologies and poetic epiphanies, is of a book that systematically warns us against taking books too seriously.

As for the title: well, I'm stumped. Perhaps, like the inscrutable God he fulminates against so well, Kuppner has left a riddle that isn't supposed to be solved. But you won't read a more dazzling collection of aphorisms, elegies and wisecracks than Kuppner's Arioflotga." - https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/book-reviews-eunoia-arioflotga-1-1300566[Stuart Kelly]

...

"Goodsir Smith, who drew from poetry from the Far East, shares Kuppner’s nimble and fluid ability to code-switch and move from the sublime to the ridiculous in the space of a line or two. The difference is that Kuppner has managed to sustain this for the length of a book of some 120 pages, which is a feat to be marvelled at, and of course enjoyed. The Third Mandarin seeks to re-inject some amusement into poetry that has long become largely dry and academic. Edwin Morgan, once writing about the poetry of Goodsir Smith, claimed that he had created a ‘deutero’ Edinburgh where things operated beneath the surface and weren’t quite as they initially appeared. There is certainly some mileage in saying that what Goodsir Smith did for a boozy subterranean Edinburgh Kuppner does for a bygone Imperial China of debauched and lascivious philosophers, sages and monks.

...

Kuppner, who is also a novelist, brings his narrative skill to the handling of The Third Mandarin. While the book sets out to undermine those in thrall to the mystical East who are in search of wisdom and profundity by sticking ‘faithfully to the path of least significance’, it is still held together by a number of recurring stories, plots and ideas. Many of the quatrains give us different viewpoints or interpretations on a set event, while others are almost metatextual, giving us endless alternative lines and rhymes for the poem in question. The two major underlying strands are the mysterious ‘Third Mandarin’ – who features in song throughout the book but only really materialises in the fifth section – and the whereabouts of the ever-elusive ‘Aunt, the retired Imperial Concubine, Swaying Blossom’. A relative of Swaying Blossom makes the pilgrimage to her ‘Hillside Retreat’ each year on her birthday and, ‘alas!’ finds her absent each time. Many years pass as the book moves on and it is only in the penultimate quatrain, the punchline payoff of The Third Mandarin, that we are given the denouement as to why she is avoiding her relative." - https://www.thebottleimp.org.uk/2018/12/the-third-mandarin-by-frank-kuppner/[Richie McCaffery]

*****
Viktor lives with a depressed penguin named Misha. Viktor is also depressed despite recently acquiring a job writing obituaries for VIPs in anticipation of their deaths. He fills the obituaries with philosophical musings about life and loss. Since his subjects are still living, Misha's obituaries (like his short stories and unfinished novels) remain unpublished. A greater cause of Viktor's unhappiness, however, is his isolation -- he feels much like his penguin, who stands in the corner for long stretches, staring at the wall. Viktor feels "remote from events and even from life itself." Eventually a government official whose obituary Viktor has written falls from a window and Viktor learns of a connection between his writing, the man's death, and the rioting the death precipitates. Viktor later learns that his editor has a hidden purpose for publishing the obits -- a purpose that causes Viktor to ponder the role of death in a planned economy.

Viktor finds his solitude eased by the presence of Sonya, the four-year-old daughter of a militia officer who drops her off with Viktor before disappearing. Yet Viktor's feeling of seclusion is supplanted by an uneasy sense that the new situation created by his temporary visitor is precarious, that in the absence of any real attachments his respite from loneliness is vulnerable to fate. The addition of a nanny allows Viktor to imagine he is part of a family, but he knows the family -- like much of the life that surrounds him -- is only an illusion.

Death and the Penguin is set in Ukraine, a country troubled by hardship and violence. A sense of menace pervades the novel; people live with the expectation that death --or worse -- is lurking nearby. Yet most of Kurkov's characters are generous and kind-hearted. They have adjusted to their circumstances: "The once terrible was now commonplace, meaning that people accepted it as the norm and went on living, instead of getting needlessly agitated. For them, as for Viktor, the main thing, after all, was still to live, come what might." Perseverance in the face of darkness is a theme that runs through Death and the Penguin. Still, while Viktor has always believed that "a hard life is better than an easy death," he understands why others disagree.

There is a surrealistic quality to some of the novel's events: letters and packages mysteriously appear in Viktor's apartment despite his locked door; Misha is much in demand at increasingly common funerals for members of criminal organizations. Viktor decides it is better not to think about things he doesn't understand. In his world, too much knowledge can be dangerous. The novel takes an even stranger turn toward darkness when Misha requires an extreme remedy for a medical condition. At that point Viktor mourns for the loss of the simple, comprehensible life of his childhood.

There are probably many ways to understand Death and the Penguin, but I see it as an allegorical story about the loss of innocence -- a loss that afflicts individuals as they experience life and societies as they confront oppression. But Death and the Penguin can also be read more simply, as a dark comedy, an engaging story about a man, a girl, and a penguin doing their best to deal with the daily mysteries of life. The reader gets the sense that Misha, staring quizzically at his human roommates, is just as puzzled about complex human behavior as are the adult human characters. I think it would be difficult to read this novel and not derive something worthwhile from it, even if it's only a smile. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVK9KYGLQUCGV/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1860469450[TChris]

Andrey Kurkov does in this book exactly what he did in the previews one: he throws his hero into the most extreme and extravagant situations and using black humor as his weapon of choice he once again comes to describe the world as it came to be after the fall of the Soviet Union.

At the beginning of the novel we meet Viktor on-board a big ship heading for Antarctica, where he's supposed to settle in a research facility. During the journey he becomes a very good friend with a mysterious man called Stanislav Bronikovsky, a man who's very sure, and afraid, that someone's following him. While playing chess and drinking vodka the two men will come so close to each other that the latter will trust the former with a very serious and kind of mysterious mission, and he'll also offer him the means to see it through. So, using Stanislav's Polish passport, Viktor will return to Kiev, his home town, which he had to leave in a hurry not so long ago, hunted as he was by some criminals.

Arriving there though, he'll come face to face with a few surprises, as things during his absence seem to have taken a turn for the better and for the worse at the same time. On the one hand he'll find out that his life is no longer under threat, but on the other he'll also discover that his girlfriend Nina and his kind of adopted daughter Sonia are now living in his house with another man. For some reason though he'll not get as upset as one would expect about that. Besides, he has other things in his mind. Firstly he has to learn where his beloved Misha is, and then he has to honor his word and deliver a package to Stanislav's wife in Moscow.

How is he going to do that? Well, he'll once again be blessed with good fortune. Thus from the one day to the next he'll find himself landing a great job, as he will be hired by an ambitious politician to write his speeches. The latter will not only pay him good money but will also do whatever he can to discover the whereabouts of missing Misha. As they are both soon to find out Viktor can thrive in a job like this: he does not only write outstanding speeches but also organizes a few quite original events for his employer, while when needed he's not unwilling to offer his not so outlandish advice: "Once elected, you never stop promising."

His career in the political arena will not last for long, but during it he'll play his part in some outrageous events, while its end will find him on his way to Moscow. There he'll meet, as planned, Stanislav's wife and thus fulfill his duty. Hell, he'll do even more than that. However, as a man on a mission, he cannot stay still, so soon enough he'll hit the road once again, heading for Chechnya this time, where, according to his sources, Misha is. As expected when there he'll once again go through a kind of hilarious, for the reader, hell before reaching his promised land, the penguin. But that is not the end, since it's exactly then that his new odyssey into unknown waters will begin.

Kurkov, repeating the feat of Death and the Penguin, tells us a story that doesn't seem to take anything seriously, not even itself, and which can be read as an adventure or a comedy or even as social commentary. However, no matter what the Americans insist to say, for me this is not a crime novel. The author is interested in entertaining the reader, but not through the suspense and the action. He simply seems to say: "Just relax, and everything will be fine." Relax and enjoy, I would say instead! - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C8MFGQRFBAMO/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099461692[Lakis Fourouklas]

*****
My favorite Lafferty novel is Fourth Mansions, but this is a close second. Indelible images and ideas from these two books have forever penetrated my brain. I didn't have any good idea of who Thomas More was when I first read Past Master, other than that he had written Utopia and had perhaps meant it to be ironic. Since then, every bright idea for the future is tagged "utopian" (dark visions like Blade Runner are called dystopias).

After seeing the film of the play of A Man for All Seasons, about Sir Thomas More VS King Henry VIII, I'd think of that character when reading Past Master. But not much background is necessary to get the story, such as it is. A future utopia is falling apart, and its leaders ask a computer to find the perfect ruler. With Laffertarian irony, it turns out to be the man who coined the term "utopia" (or popularized it), the mediaeval scholar Thomas More.

Astrobe, the utopia, however, is only sustained so long as people believe in it. Or at any rate, mechanical wolf-like killers are dispatched to eliminate those who lose their belief in the Astrobe dream. The tone, however, is rollicking, with black (noir) humor, and much of the book would be at home on Futurama. Lafferty trumps himself by relating the story through the eyes of Thomas More, a stranger in this strange land. "Lafferty has the power to ignite fire behind your eyeballs," Roger Zelazny noted (or something like that). Laffertarians who've only sampled the short stories, get ready for the full-length ride of Past Master. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JISJGGPDQGRF/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441653030[Gord Wilson]

*****
An incidental remark about allegories reminded me of this little volume by R.A. Lafferty. In many ways, I think it is his finest, although all of his efforts are remarkable. Whatever your preference, 'Fourth Mansions' remains the most unusual of its genre, an allegory that refuses to take itself seriously.

When Freddy Foley, newspaperman and innocent, discovers that certain people seem to reappear at irregular intervals he insists on investigating and soon finds himself hip deep in a metaphysical odyssey. He discovers that there is not one, but four separate subcultures that share the world with humanity. The best of these are the badgers that guard the entrances of the human domain. The worst are the toads, the ones who sleep and are reborn. These are dedicated to keeping the world from evolving to the next level. Every time things get better they make sure they really get worse.

Then there are the snakes whose wild mental energy runs out of control. For them the rest of us are toys to play with, energy to use up. Finally, there are the unfledged falcons. Well intentioned, they are the premature warriors, champions of violent solutions. Best to worst they spell little good for Freddy, whose truth seeking will lead him to the tops of mountains and the cells of asylums. 'Goof gloriously,' the snakes order poor Freddy, and so he does.

Lafferty performs an unexpected deconstruction of the mythology of man's progress, and creates an entirely unique narrative for inner progress. Foley is Everyman (Foley = The Fool) on a journey towards a higher plane of being, impeded by creatures that symbolize his own weaknesses. The tale is told tongue-in-cheek, a burlesque parody of one pilgrim's progress. Filled with more mad characters than all of 'Canterbury Tales,' the reader is often left unsure whether to laugh or take notes.

Of course, this is the great flaw of allegory; it never loses the taint of lecture. Plot serves message unforgivingly. 'Fourth Mansions' is only partly fiction as we progress from lesson to lesson. The good news is that Lafferty refuses to fall into the trap of being tedious, and, instead, allows the allegory to parody itself. Still, this is unusual entertainment, and not meant for everyone. Full of mind games and obscure symbolism made garish, it is a child of the late 60's, although I think it's intent is more valid now then it was then. Nowadays I sometimes wonder if the toads have managed to win after all. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSNDK3ESTXNP/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557850488&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Marc Ruby]

*Nine Hundred Grandmothers* (1970)

*****
"Excitement is in the discovery of the machine..." This is a great collection of short stories; a few of which have continuity to each other. "Nine Hundred Grandmothers" is a spiraling inside joke and a nested doll. "Land of the Great Horses" is a great migration to a gap in space and time. "Ginny Wrapped in the Sun" is a particular favorite having an all-knowing monster-child at its center; the same goes for "Seven Day Terror". I loved the Benjamin Button-like challenge laid out in "The Six Fingers of Time": "It is only very good people who have no fear at all of the unknown.' "Frog on the Mountain" called to mind Burrough's John Carter of Mars works, with a very nice twist. The blindness and subsequent self-awareness of AI runs a neat yarn through "All the People": "Anthony had a sad feeling at leaving his brain behind him." Two of the linked stories featuring the Camiroi race, "Primary Education of the Camiroi" and "Polity and Custom of the Camiroi", were thickly detailed studies (packed with nice glimmers and sharp lines: "Even buzzards sometimes gag.") but my least favorite stories in the book. They were heavy, not as nimble as the rest of the collection. Two other linked stories, "Thus We Frustrate Charlemagne" and "What's the Name of that Town?", follow the exploits of Epiktistes, a super computer, and his scientist pals with too much free time at their disposal. "Slow Tuesday Night" was in the vein of Moorcock's "Dancers at the End of Time". The snake-oil salesmanship versus the angry mob in "Hog-Belly Honey" was neatly done as were the Rip VanWinkle antics of "One at a Time".

I love how Lafferty takes Earth-human confidence and superiority and turns it on its ear. The Earth-human goes to study the universe, head high and looking down his sharp nose at all he observes. And Earth-human is handed a big serving of rotted crow each time. The hunter becomes the hunted. The observer is being observed. "Snuffles" is a shining example spinning around the definition of dumb animal. As is "Name of the Snake" - and its good old-fashioned punch line: "My wife makes a fine soup. I will miss her." The same goes for the Twilight Zone-like "The Hole on the Corner" and the stinging disillusionment of Charles Cogsworth when he invents a way to see the world "Through Other Eyes". Powerful stuff.

Without fail, Lafferty whacks humanity on the head: "A roomful of miracles wasn't enough." - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22HHQZYW288FJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1880448971[Akethan]

*****
Another truly unusual book from RA Lafferty. Describing Lafferty's writing style is almost impossible. Oklahoma surrealism? North American magical realism? Lafferty is, in my opinion, the most neglected substantial American writer of the last half century. This book is a bit different from his science fiction novels. This is a historical novel set in mid-19th century Europe. This is a genre Lafferty explored previously. His novel Okla Hannali is about the notorious 19th century Indian removals to Oklahoma. This book is part of a projected tetralogy. The second book was published, but is now almost impossible to fine, but not apparently the 3rd and 4th books, for which there are supposedly complete manuscripts. The Flame is Green is a distinctly unusual view of the revolutions of 1848-1851. As is common with much of Lafferty's writing, the book is hard to describe concisely and distinguished by an almost hallucinatory style. Again, like much of Lafferty's work, the result is compelling but somewhat puzzling, though much may have been revealed in the projected later installments that were never published. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R13W66BAIQG1BG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802703461&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[R.

[[The_Devil_Is_Dead]]
*The Devil Is Dead* (1971)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Devil-Is-Dead-Lafferty/dp/1557850461/[Amazon]

*****
To fully appreciate this literally wonderful book, one must realize that it is only one part of a sprawling saga, the "Argo Mythos", revolving around that legendary ship and those who have sailed on it. Within that saga lies the "Devil Is Dead" trilogy, of which this book (confusingly, of the same name) is but the middle part, its predecessor being "Archipelago" and its successor being "More Than Melchisedech" (which, to further complicate score-keeping, was published in three volumes, named "Tales of Chicago", "Tales of Midnight", and "Argo"). Also part of the Argo Mythos is the novel "Dotty", and--arguably--the "Coscuin" tetralogy (of which the final two books are yet unpublished, though the manuscripts exist).

Finnegan, the chief protagonist, is adapted from the character Finn McCool of Irish legend, and parts of the saga derive from that legendarium; he also, however, partakes to some extent of the nature of Jason, the hero we normally associate with the Argo. Further--though one can read the saga without needing to know this--Lafferty has adopted the Argo itself as symbolic of the Roman Catholic Church, of which Lafferty was--to put it mildly--an ardent adherent.

This novel, the saga, the entirety of Lafferty's work: it is all literary genius of a high order, something the casual reader may miss owing to Lafferty's very down-to-earth writing style, which in many ways is almost conversational in tone. But then, the definition of a professional is someone who makes it all look easy. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVMHHOQ229VK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557850461&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lynn Walker]

[[Arrive_at_Easterwine]]
*Arrive at Easterwine: The Autobiography of a Ktistec Machine* (1971)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Arrive-Easterwine-Autobiography-Ktistec-Machine/dp/B000JWRBUQ/[Amazon]

*****
Arrive at Easterwine is a deeply religious and very carefully structured book. It is an autobiographical story, told in the first person, of an intelligent computer, Epiktistes the first Ktistek machine. The novel focuses on the three tasks for which he was created, to find a leader, a love, and a liaison--an understanding of the true shape of the universe. When Epikt announces these tasks near the beginning of the novel, he states that he is likely to fail in one or all of them, and that his failure may be as important as the tasks themselves. Each of the three tasks fails to some degree, and each failure tells us about humanity and asks us how ready we as a species and a culture are for the approach of the divine.

The book is broken into three fairly well defined sections, one for each task, and each section is broken into several smaller episodes. Some episodes are straight narrative of events and some are ruminations on the meanings of symbols. Some of the events described turn out to be metaphor and not real. However each smaller episode has as its theme the subject of the main task. For example, when Epikt is investigating the nature of love, there is a wonderful story about a well-meaning clod who goes to see a speech by a fire-eyed prophet. Both the clod and the prophet are mobile extensions of Epikt himself, and they both have overwhelming love for humanity, but express it in nearly opposite terms.

I must admit that when I first read the book, the structure completely went over my head, and the book seemed like a terrific mess. My first impression was that the plot quickly unraveled and went nowhere. Then I read it a second time and paid attention to what Epikt told us in the first chapter. I realized just how tightly structured this novel is. Nothing is wasted in the narrative. The beginning of the book tells us what the structure will be, then the story unfolds to fulfill that structure.

The book contains many wonderful moments that are a joy to read for themselves. There are the interactions of the members of the Institute for Impure Science--among the most beloved recurring characters in Lafferty's oeuvre. There is wonderful wordplay, such as the riff on how most of the characters are fellahin, or fellah (look it up), and Valery comments that she looks kind of strange for a fella. There is beautiful, spiritually moving visual description, like the time they start creating snow with unusual geometries that builds towers that give tantalizing almost-glimpses of the form of the ultimate city--the shape of the truly fulfilled and evolved community. There is the introduction which plays on the old fictional trope of an autobiography being mysteriously delivered to the author. Most impressive among all of this is how well Lafferty maintains the voice of Epikt as something slightly outside of and apart from Humanity--providing us an outside perspective from which to examine ourselves.

This book takes patience and an open mind to finish, and it may require at least two readings to understand its structure. If you are willing to give it that effort, it is a richly rewarding read. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SNX2J6H2ZKWA/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JWRBUQ&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Kevin A.

*****
Fans of R. A. Lafferty (1914-2002) can make a very strong case for him as the greatest American author who has ever lived. Yet even so, he has always been an little-known author and now seems fading towards total obscurity. Both in the speculative fiction community and in the world of 'serious' literature, few of even the most devoted fans will recognize his name. If Lafferty does drop out of people's awareness entirely, the world will lose more than merely a lot of great books. Lafferty's body of work, produced in a amazingly short thirteen years, is one of the great creative achievements of the human race.

"Okla Hannali", not even viewed as one of Lafferty's better novels, is a stunning achievement. Every element of the author's craft is used to near perfection: plot, character, setting, emotional arch, and language. And language. No review could do justice to Lafferty's brilliance with words, yet I must try.

"Okla Hannali" is written in many voices. An individual paragraph may sound entirely different from the next, with different vocabulary and different structure. Yet as with all of Lafferty, there is an enormous amount of method behind the madness. The voices Lafferty chooses are at every time the appropriate voices. They are the words, the styles, the flows that are exactly right for communicating the story. Lafferty set out to tell the history of the Choctaw people. To do so he had to overcome both the racist view of Indians as savages and the romanticized view of them as peace-loving and perfect. Crushing these barriers meant using some odd linguistic styles.

For instance, Lafferty tells us early on that the Choctaws never understood punctuation, and simply spoke in a stream of words without clear starts and ends. He captures this style:

"Pushmataha say that I leave my grin there grinning at him and walk out from behind it and take a ramble and a drink and a nap all the while he was hold his breath and swell up and turn purple and then I come back rested and slip into my grin again and so have him tricked"

Is reading this difficult? That's your call, of course, but you get used to it as the book goes along. But this is important. Lafferty wants to show you what life was like among the Choctaw Indians. What life was really really like.

Of course Lafferty would never settle for merely so small a goal. There is purpose here. The purpose is to document the abuses that were heaped on the Indians during the eighteenth century, bu the government. To show that no matter what excuses are offered up, there's no decent explanation for what was done to the Native American tribes in these years. And to that end, Lafferty fights with every imaginable weapon: understatement, overstatement, misdirection, fantasy sequences, subplots, historical notes, and more. Most often, though, he tells the truth. For instance when the Indians assess the land that the government tricked them into accepting in Oklahoma:

"They examined the land to the south for a month. They all realized now - (what the worldly of them had always known) - that the north-south distance was about a third of that represented to them, and that the unidsputed domain of the Plains Indians was much closer than they had been told. Three quarters of the land for which they had traded their southern acres did not exist."

Rafael A. Lafferty believed in things. He believed strongly, believed passionately, and fought to make readers see things his way. "Okla Hannali" is a majestic novel (though as I said it's not even one of his better books) It swings from outrageous comedy to terrible tragedy to poignant romance to gritty action so deftly that you don't notice till the end that the entire world, for one group of people was destroyed. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DL75RRTV4Y5D/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671783017&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[not4prophet]

*****
This book is two separate novellas about consensus reality. "Where Have You Been Sandaliotis" is about the sudden appearance of a 300-mile long peninsula in the Mediterranean that upon reflection has been there all along, or has it? Constantine Quiche, the greatest detective in the world investigates whether this is real or a fraud of unprecedented scale. Is he really the greatest detective in the world, or was he created as part of the same fraud?

The stronger novella of the two, "The Three Armageddons of Enniscorthy Sweeny" follows the life of a great playwright and the change in history of the 20th Century. The 20th Century is the golden century, the century in which humanity realizes war is no longer possible and universal prosperity and well being is. It starts with the inauguration of Harold Standpipe, the tall, thoughtful black statesman and humanitarian from Chicago as President of the US in 1901. Then in 1917, Enniscorthy Sweeny produces his first Armaggedon opera about a tremendous world war, and soon history adjusts to make it have been real. Then he produces his second Armaggedon opera about an even more horrific world war, and history adjusts itself again. They are preparing to produce his third Armageddon opera--as one historian notes, the situation worsens.

This was R.A. Lafferty at the top of his form in the early '70s. Dense, introspective prose filled with wordplay and events rushing by breathlessly. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29217B6F89OIN/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0523401485[Kevin A. Cheek]

An allegory with a teenage girl as the Savior? Yes, but in Lafferty's inimitable style, this battle between good and evil takes on more than Christian undertones. It reads like a myth from many cultures. OK, she arrives in a spaceship, but to call this science fiction is like squeezing an elephant's foot into a baby's shoe. Like many of Lafferty's novels, this will reward a second reading. The man goes that deep, and that high.

*****
Having been treated unfairly, Brannagan had sworn that, as soon as he acquired a billion thalers, he would set up a fund whereby any one-legged Irishman anywhere in the universe could receive free transportation to Klepsis and also could receive any help he needed upon arriving at that blessed place.

"How will we define 'Irish'?" the first adminstrator of the fund asked Brannagan.

"If they have Irish names, they are Irsh altogether," Brannagan laid it down. "Few of the other breeds would be caught dead with an Irish name."

Of the three peg-legs on the flight from Apateon Planet to Klepsis, one was clearly Black, one was probably Gaea-Earth Eurasian, and one was plainly Latino; their names were Andrew "Gold Coast" O'Mally, Long John Tong Tyrone, and Conchita O'Brian. Gold Coast and Long John had their left legs missing, Conchita her right.

"When are you going to have your leg cut off, Terps?" Conchita sked Terpsichore Callagy. "There's several people getting amputated right now down by the ship's handball courts. You get a rebate on your passage after you get your leg cut off. you'd better go get it done now."

- page 3 of "The Annals of Klepsis".

That is classic Lafferty, as, indeed, is the entire book. The man is hilarious. Beyond hilarious, uproarious. Not just in little chunks, but constantly from start to finish, every page delivers the laughs. Indeed, almost every paragraph. However, R. A. Lafferty was never about being funny. The humor, despite being possibly the best ever written, is only a clever cover and distraction device to get you off balance. You're laughing so hard that it may be thirty pages or more before you realize that what you're laughing at is murder, torture, mutilation and so forth.

So now, what is "Annals of Klepsis" about? Buggered if I know, but it has something to with a lawless planet called Klepsis. Two identical twin princes, Franco and Henry, are vying for control. Meanwhile, we also have some ghosts, buried treasures, slave auctions, interplanetary jumping in canoes and all the other good stuff. Of course, no one can truly summarize a Lafferty book and only a fool would try. No one can even explain his tone or even categorize his books by genre. But as has been said before, he certainly was extremely good at what he did, whatever it was. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIY5R8LDVNVR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441023207&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[not4prophet]

*Ringing Changes* (1984)

*****
I probably shouldn't even be writing this, as it might spoil the joke. But after all these years, where's the harm?

You might have read a lot of quotes from science fiction writers about what a wonderful science fiction writer R A Lafferty is. He isn't. He is wonderful indeed, but he is not a science fiction writer. He is an anti-sci-fi writer, the best and only. He is a Trojan horse in the science fiction community, what contemporary people call a "troll".

Simply put, everything Lafferty values is the polar opposite of what science fiction writers and fans typically value. His work is a very thinly disguised mockery of everything science fiction stands for, and that's the joke.

Here's why it is so funny: none of the much more famous sci-fi writers like Delany, Gaiman and Ellison, who give him high marks and write nice little blurbs for his books - even realize Lafferty can't stand them and is making fun of them.

Lafferty is a religious man and a traditionalist and every word he writes is an attack on modernity and its worldview and institutions. To anyone with a background in ancient religion, Platonism, or especially the perennial philosophy, this is screamingly obvious (I don't know if he arrived at this position through study of such subjects but it hardly matters; he was a practicing devotee of an orthodox traditional religion and that will get you there just the same, eventually).

But to anyone still inside the bubble of modernity, such things are inconceivable. They have such a huge blind spot to reality that they simply can't process what Lafferty is saying, so they interpret every word he writes as somehow conforming to their own deviant, relativist worldview. They always seem to feel like Lafferty is getting at something deeper that is just beyond their reach, but they don't know what it is, so they invent rationalizations for why it must be the same kinds of things they believe in - since he ostensibly writes about the same kinds of things they write about. And Lafferty knew this would happen, in fact he deliberately brings it about, and makes fools of them all.

Lafferty states his position over and over, but always just a little sideways, tongue in cheek, and the sci-fi people, being what they are, never figured it out. He consistently and repeatedly attacks every institution of modernity that science fiction writers hold dear, especially the notions of progress, materialist science, relativism, egalitarianism, technocracy, atheism, darwinism, and so on, and none of them even realize it is happening.

Some simple examples from this volume. I have seen more than one analysis of Lafferty favorably comparing him to Joyce or Pynchon, who are in fact exactly the kind of modernists beloved of the hippy generation that he mocks in this volume's "Sky" - and very clearly says he is making fun of in the introduction to the story. In "Ungodly Mice", Ringing Changes pg 105, he openly refers to darwinists and democrats- small d; Lafferty is no believer in mob rule - as "confused" and many of his stories about "evolution" state that men were never monkeys or that evolution, whatever it is, was sudden and not gradual as Darwinists believe. He says in the intro to "Name my Name" that the world is an "apish shambles now", which obviously means (especially in the context of much of his other work) that the ancient world was superior to the modern, but the modernists don't realize that's what he is getting at. He often uses ghosts as characters, such as the recurring character Mary Mondo who appears here often, to indicate the traditional view of a higher, platonic reality of which the material world is only a reflection, contrasting this to the modern scientistic, progresivist view that matter is all that is real. He attacks the automobile in "Interurban Queen" and finds it lacking against the superior pastoral world that existed before it appeared, again, the spaceship jockeys don't get that he hates the whole modern world because he symbolically and satirically sets a few stories on other planets here and there. If he hates cars what do you imagine he thinks of their precious rocketship fantasies? He loves (american) Indians and features them in lots of stories - such as Days of Grass here - because they had a traditional culture, that is, one in which all social activity was centered around religion. Conversely he attacks what white men have become not from the political correctness typical of sci-fi types who believe in progress, but from the opposite side of the spectrum. I could give a thousand examples and prove this beyond any doubt but even then the moderns would not be able to see it, and only a few examples will suffice for those who are in on the joke, so there is no point in going further.

Of course, along the way he makes plenty of other good jokes, but the big joke is especially on the humanist modernists who praise him, thinking he is one of them. He very openly lets us in on it in the last sentence of the intro to this book, saying "the superior ones among you will even be delighted in several places". I promise you, he wasn't referring to other science fiction writers, so-called. And the only critic I have seen that is even in the same ballpark that is necessary to understand Lafferty is the literary elitist Eric Walker.

Oh, and by the way - Lafferty is the best fiction writer that America has produced, or at this late hour in its history, the best it ever will, and if you must classify him as such, the only "science fiction" writer worth reading. But to me there is an easy way to tell what is sci-fi, and what isn't. Like everything else that bubbles up from the cauldron of relativism and modernity, sci-fi is made of the artificial and the superficial, and therefore has no permanence. Modern ideas and artifacts must be replaced constantly because they are only a facade; as soon as the fad ends or the emperor's nakedness is exposed, the next new thing must immediately take its place, so the constant lie of consumerism and illusory progress can keep churning out new garbage before the whole thing implodes - because if anyone stopped to actually think for a minute, the illusion would disappear into its own emptiness. Thus, sci-fi stories from the past are always obviously ridiculous, anachronistic and unreadable after a few years, like any other of the discarded trash of modernity. Heinlein and Asimov and Ellison and the rest, even Dick and the later wave of sf writers, are even sillier now than when they were published. But Lafferty, like his distant cousins the science fantasists (think Jack Vance) is smelling fresh as a daisy and only gets more and more right as the years go by. I bet he outlasts Pynchon and Joyce and that gang of rambling relativists that everybody talks about and nobody reads, too, because unlike them he has method to his madness. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2VJQK6E754D/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441726070&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[k wolf]

*****
This is Ray's autobiography, except that he does not appear anywhere in it as a character.
It is a semi-fictionalized account of the time and place he grew up in,
the people he grew up with (volume one, MY HEART LEAPS UP, concerns Tulsa, Oklahoma
in the 1920's as seen through the eyes of a group of schoolchildren), and the things he saw during his life.
It is without a doubt the best of the Lafferty books coming out from the
small press, and someday Chris may even get around to finishing all
four volumes.

If you are new to Lafferty, the place to start is with one of the collections, either LAFFERTY IN ORBIT or the
older collections like 900 GRANDMOTHERS or STRANGE DOINGS or RINGING CHANGES that
you might be able to find in second-hand shops. The best novels to start with
would be REEFS OF EARTH, SPACE CHANTEY (rare Ace double from the '60s), SINDBAD, ANNALS OF KLEPSIS,
PAST MASTER (his best-known, but not the easiest read), ARCHIPELEGO (OP small press book), THE DEVIL IS DEAD. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FKRYCP65GN5/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=093605526X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*Serpent's Egg* (1987)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Serpents-Egg-R-Lafferty/dp/0809532441/[Amazon]

*****
Meet the Twelve Children of the Experiments, each one hyper-intelligent, each one a Mega-Person, each one under suspicion and surveillance as a potential Serpent's Egg to be crushed in the shell:

The Lynn-Randal Experiment: Ruddy Lord Randall, the young male human; Inneall, the young female ambulatory computer; Axel, the young male Golden Ape (or Blue-Eyed Ape or Gargoyle, a member of the Unfallen People or Second Humanity).

The Wintergreen-Luna Experiment: Marino the young male seal ('his mind and his personality and his outgoing spirit gleamed as his hide gleamed with its wetness in the sun when he came out of the water'); Luas the young male angel (who wouldn't be greatly missed in heaven - 'he was of one of the lower classes of the highest of creatures'); Henryetta, the young female human (flame-haired, flame-tempered, and flame-powered, gifted with pyro-kinesis).

The Dorantes-Saleh Experiment: Lutin, the young female python (a prophetess); Dubu, the young female bear (whom all the other children called Little Mother); Schimp, the young male chimpanzee (erudite, degreed with a doctorate, he regularly wore an academic cap and gown).

The Gruenbaum-McGregor Experiment: Gajah the unborn female Indian elephant (in the tenth and final year of her gestation in the womb of her mother, an Empress elephant; she communicates by telepathy as well as by means of a percussion language on a tiny drum inside her mother's belly); Carcajou, the young male wolverine (half animal, half devil); Popugai, the young male parrot (from New Zealand, big enough to kill and eat a sheep; with perfect recall and understanding and pronunciation, 'he knew the basic vocabularies of six hundred human languages, and of many thousands of insect, reptile, animal, and bird languages').

The location is only barely named, but this is one of Lafferty's many Oklahoma stories. It is the end of summer in the year 2035, specifically the Last Three Days of Summerset.

Each set of three 'children' grew up together and now all twelve have been brought together as each approaches his or her tenth birthday. Their project has been to find 'new ways of looking at the world, but not too cockeyed new'. But it looks like they have indeed been 'too cockeyed new' in their shining intelligence and vision and thus the Dolophonoi, the knife-wielding assassins, are drawing near to put an end to it before it really gets started.

Serpent's Egg is another of Lafferty's many apocalypses and shares themes (e.g. 'is this world an Egg that will shortly birth a new world?') strongly in common with Past Master (1968), Arrive At Easterwine (1971), and Annals of Klepsis (1983). The novel also shares, in a more minor key, the theme of 'is any of this real or are we just dreaming?' with Where Have You Been, Sandaliotis? and The Three Armageddons of Enniscorthy Sweeney (these two short novels are collected together in Apocalypses, 1977) and East of Laughter (1988). The novel's satiric dystopian quality (e.g. a Kangaroo Court rules the Global Village) resonates with works like Lafferty's novella Ishmael Into the Barrens (1971) and his short story 'And Walk Now Gently Through the Fire' (1972). The characters are said to be living on the Floating World and this critique of modern society's lack of depth frequently recurs in Lafferty's fiction - e.g. Fourth Mansions (1969), 'Encased in Ancient Rind' (1971), From the Thunder Colt's Mouth, (1975), and 'Bequest of Wings' (1978).

*****
Lafferty in Orbit is an anthology of the Lafferty stories appearing in the famous Orbit series edited by Damon Knight. Playful, outrageous, ridiculous and sublime, Lafferty the magician performs open-heart surgery on reality, and just for kicks removes the lungs, liver and both kidneys, juggles with them, puts them back in random order, sews up the patient and walks away grinning. The operation is always successful, and we wake up feeling hunky-dory. Included in this collection is "Narrow Valley" an often-anthologized fantasy that is one of the funniest stories ever written. What happens when an Oklahoma valley a half-mile wide appears to be no bigger than a drainage ditch to the family of homesteaders who just bought it? "The Hole on the Corner" is tour-de-force science-fiction that will leave you rolling in the aisles. Lafferty the usher leads you back to your seat and mesmerizes you with "Continued on Next Rock," one of the most haunting and transcendent fantasies ever penned. Then comes a story, "Configuration of the North Shore" of a man obsessed by a recurring dream. Lafferty takes you out of normal consciousness and into the dream world where everything is possible, yet you never quite find the thing you are searching for so desperately, if it is a thing at all... Every story is unique and bears the Lafferty watermark, each time held up the light never appearing the same, but forcing you to see in a completely different way. Read this book, but check your reality after every story--or you may find yourself trapped inside. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBBIHU356R3V/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0962382485&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ron Ginzler]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Tales-midnight-More-than-Melchisedech/dp/0921322305/[Amazon]

*****
"Rather longer than the first two books in the "Argo" or "The Devil is Dead" trilogy, _More Than Melchisedech_ is a polymorph, it keeps changing shape. It starts out looking like the life of a magician (the titular Melchisedech, or sometimes Michael, Duffey). Then it becomes a set of apocalyptic fantasies. And it ends as - but that would be giving away too much, wouldn't it?

And that's just the main novel: it is epilogued with a few short stories that compliment and contribute to the whole, and, indeed, the ending of the trilogy proper is embedded in the last of these stories, "How Many Miles to Babylon," in which - but that would also be giving away _much_ too much.

But this third book _does_ explain the lanky and disjoint feel of the trilogy as a whole. It is about huge issues like, well, the Apocalypse, and the nature of the Church, and what it means to be human (and superhuman and subhuman and parahuman), and the whole thing may be a huge shaggy human story.

But be that as it may, it's an engaging - in a lanky and disjoing way - novel, funny - in a "H'mmm" way more than a "Bwahahaha" way - and full of depth, though the depths of it are not easily plumbed: I'm quite certain that I missed a great deal.

The closest thing to a comparison I can come up with for Lafferty's masterpiece is Gene Wolfe's Solar Cycle, a monumental work that says as much by what it doesn't say (and alludes to or elides) as by what it does. Sadly, Lafferty never had the publicity or popularity (well, more or less) of Wolfe, but his work is still there for those who can find it." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDFYGXLQ3IEXX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0921322305[Dan'l Danehy-Oakes]

*****
Born into a family of nobility, Tommaso Landolfi was an erudite man of letters - author of novels and stories, translator of Russian and French writers and literary critic at large. He was also a reclusive, eccentric, peculiar man who enjoyed lots of gambling. Italo Calvino, a personal friend of Landolfi, writes a most informative introduction, providing the historical, cultural and literary context for Landolfi's writing. The 24 stories in this collection may be read on many levels of meaning and analysis, or simply read for sheer enjoyment, enjoyment because these stories, which can be as fantastic, obsessive or horrific as the tales of Poe or Borges, are accessible and fun. Thank you, Kathrine Jason, for your clear, easy-to-read English translation.

To give a taste of what is to be found in this collection, I offer the following comments on 5 stories:

Chicken Fate - Told with tongue-in-cheek humor, this tale begins with a strong sense of foreboding as two chicken farmers, Ted and Joe, talk about how their new hormone-rich chicken feed is causing some serious changes in their chickens; Joe tells Ted how a chicken even looks at him as if it were a human and not a chicken. The story moves along and Ted and Joe find out just how huge and human-like their chickens turn out to be after having eaten all those hormones.

The Kiss - A tale of horror, where a notary and bachelor who is `hopelessly timid with women" is visited by a incorporeal creature who gives him kisses. The story becomes progressively more fantastic, reaching a crescendo as we read, "On the last night, a gigantic, overturned chasm opened before his eyes - his body and soul - a grayish whirlpool like a matrix or a conch; it loomed, and from the apex of its spiral, it beckoned to him." What is really beckoning to the notary? Is it his own sexuality? His own fear of women? His fear of death? --- Or, perhaps all of these. This story reminds me of a number of scenes from Fillini's film - City of Women.

The Werewolf - A short-short story about two werewolves and their relationship to the moon told in first-person by one of the werewolves, a story that is something of a spoof on a traditional werewolf tale. The werewolf narrator tells us how his friend returns to their house one night carrying a bright round object, which turns out to be the moon. The werewolves consider the moon, who they refer to as `she', a disgusting and evil thing and stick it under the hood of their chimney. The moon tries to pass up through the flue. We read, "Perhaps she had to compress and deform her flabby little body to pass through; foul droplets of liquid hissing into the fire . . . " But this is the moon, after all, and the universe ultimately gets its own way. And throughout the story we are given the werewolf-narrator's running philosophy about fate and freedom.

Uxoricide - "Murdering people is easy. I have never understood all the fuss murderers make, or why they still haven't brought off or perpetrated the perfect crime; it must be simply that they haven't studied their victims closely enough." So Landolfi begins this story with tongue even deeper in his ironic cheek. The author's narrator goes on to tell us how he bound and gagged his wife before proceeding to verbally attack her in ways that would surely bring on her heart attack. Told with the panache of an aristocrat, every line of this story is laugh-aloud funny.

Words in Commotion - One morning, after brushing his teeth and spitting out the mixture of toothpaste and saliva, the narrator relates what he sees, "I don't know how to explain this: not only were they words, but they were alive and darted this way and that in the sink, which, luckily, was empty." He then has a running dialogue with a half dozen squiggly words before trying to gather them up. We read, "They didn't want to cooperate and put up a struggle, trying to befuddle me, but I forced them to explain themselves point by point. But they didn't want to be caught, to say the least, and fled every which way, so I caught and squeezed them in my cupped palm . . . " Now it is one thing to live as a member of the decaying aristocracy, it is quite another to have the toothpaste and saliva you spit out transform into talking, unruly words right there in your very own sink, providing you with first-hand experience of decaying reality. This story gives a new and expanded meaning to Nietzsche's statement, "The irrationality of a thing is no argument against its existence, rather a condition of it." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FP46U1RML6WY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670805181&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

They were good enough to express the thought that when the author grew up and became educated there might be hope for his intellect. This expectation is of no avail. All that education could do in this case has been tried and has failed. As a Professor of Political Economy in a great university, the author admits that he ought T’ to know better.

*****
STEPHEN Leacock (1869-1944) was a living paradox. A humorist and satirist with a jolly style and a stinging wit, he took delight in skewering targets ranging from contemporary college life to the works of Jane Austen. But these entertainments, most of which are still relevant and funny, were only half his output. The other half was serious political polemics. A Briton by birth, he was raised and spent most of his life in Canada. He was both a small-c and capital-C Conservative, a full-out flag-waving British imperialist who advocated immigration to his adopted country provided only that the immigrants be of pure British stock.

One of his most notable books was titled Afternoons in Utopia (1932). The lead entry, "Utopias Old and New," includes an hilarious send-up of every imagined paradisiacal society from Plato's Republic to last month's issue of Flabbergasting Fables. Probably the most influential of all utopias was Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward: 2000-1887. It spawned endless sequels and rebuttals, of which I particularly recommend Mack Reynolds's Looking Backward from the Year 2000 (1974).

I wish I had room for some hilarious excerpts from Leacock's collection, but the bottom of the page is looming. You'll have to snag a copy of the Leacock book for yourself. Just keep an eye out for Dr. Oom, the sandal-wearing and berobed, bearded future sage speaking oddly pseudo-Biblical English—and his lissome, doe-eyed daughter. Leacock's humor is wonderful. In his own time he was hugely admired by Groucho Marx, Jack Benny, and Robert Benchley. Add to that list the undersigned! - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2013/cur1303.htm[Richard A. Lupoff]

http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Pieces-Semiotext-Henri-Lefebvre/dp/1584351594/[Amazon]

*****
The Missing Pieces is an incantatory text, a catalog of what has been lost over time and what in some cases never existed. Through a lengthy chain of brief, laconic citations, Henri Lefebvre evokes the history of what is no more and what never was: the artworks, films, screenplays, negatives, poems, symphonies, buildings, letters, concepts, and lives that cannot be seen, heard, read, inhabited, or known about. It is a literary vanitas of sorts, but one that confers an almost mythical quality on the enigmatic creations it recounts -- rather than reminding us of the death that inhabits everything humans create.

Lefebvre's list includes Marcel Duchamp's (accdidentally destroyed) film of Man Ray shaving off the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's pubic hair; the page written by Balzac on his deathbed (lost); Spinoza's Treatise on the Rainbow (thrown into a fire); the final seven meters of Kerouac's original typescript for On the Road (eaten by a dog); the chalk drawings of Francis Picabia (erased before an audience); and the one moment in André Malraux's life in which he exclaimed "I believe, for a minute, I was thinking nothing." The Missing Pieces offers a treasure trove of cultural and artistic detail and will entertain even those readers not enamored of the void. - http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Pieces-Semiotext-Henri-Lefebvre/dp/1584351594/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
If you enjoyed Joseph Heller’s “Catch 22”, which is to say you like gallows humor that scoffs at the folly of thinking of “bureaucratic logic” as anything other than an oxymoron, then Stanislaw Lem’s “Memoirs Found in a Bathtub” will be right up your alley. The premise is that future archaeologists are trying to decipher what happened to humanity from a dearth of remaining documentation. One of the best and most extensive of these records is the memoirs of a bureaucrat telling of his experience in a subterranean complex that reads a lot like a spoof on the Pentagon. The 31st century timeline in which a future generation tries to understand the intervening dark ages is only discussed in the prologue, the remainder is the first person account of this bureaucrat of ill-chosen profession.

The narrator tells us about his final assignment, one that was so secret that his superiors couldn’t even tell him what it was. When he finally does get some written guidance, it’s stolen. Throughout the story, the author is shifting through various departments of this complex trying to figure out what is going on and with little initial success. At first he’s trying to figure out what his mission is, but later he’s just trying to figure out what’s real and meaningful--and if those concepts retain any usefulness. Along the way, odd and spectacular events occur that leave him thinking he’s being framed. He doesn’t know if he’s in a test, in the middle of a conspiracy, or amid a collection of lunatics.

There are sections that read quite like a “Monty Python” sketch, and the absurdist humor is sometimes like that of Douglas Adams--though more sparing and dark. There’s a scene featuring an officer who tries to talk the narrator into confessing, and I could only picture said officer in my mind as Eric Idle. Among the absurdist elements is the explanation of office operations. We are told that command was unable to deal with accurately and swiftly circulating memos because of the volume, and so they took to a random system in which paperwork was indiscriminately circulated until it happened upon the correct desk. There’s an officer who begins to chew and swallow envelops to prevent information from falling into the wrong hands. One of the best examples of absurdist humor is a conversation with a cryptologist who suggests that everything is a code and, ignoring messages that seem to be of military value and that are not coded, takes to using a machine to “decipher” random literature into nonsensical messages.

Nothing is as it seems in this book, and the humor derives from the narrator being the only individual who insists on the world making sense. If you’ve ever been in a position where you had to interact regularly with a bureaucracy, you’ll understand the value of laughing at such humor to avoid weeping. Much of the humor comes from the desire to keep things secret while trying to know everything there is. The narrator keeps finding not-so-subtle fly-shaped spy devices on his coffee saucer. There are blatant lies about behavior that takes place right before the narrator’s eyes. When he’s institutionalized, it turns out that the other inmates are not at all who they seem to be either.

If Stanislaw Lem is not an author familiar to you (he’s a Polish writer who died in 2006), this is a good work to cut your teeth on. It’s not one of his most well-known pieces, but it’s humorous and easier to follow than “Solaris.” Fans of Kurt Vonnegut and Robert Heinlein are also likely to enjoy this book. I recommend it. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RAQ0ZJUGTQDQ/[Bernie Gourlay]

*****
The title of this assembly of stories is the translator's clever triple pun: an allusion to Othello, "mortal engines" are manmade, impermanent, and sometimes deadly machines--robots, to be exact. Included are all the tales from Lem's "Fables for Robots" and three other stories ("The Sanatorium of Dr. Vliperdius," "The Hunt," and "The Mask") that double the size of the book.

The fables are like--well, fables. That is, the prose style resembles Aesop or Andersen ("Once there lived..."); the narrative recounts long-ago events; and each tale presents a message--or, at least, a lesson for us humans disguised as a moral for them robots. These eleven shorts recall Borges (or even Poe) at his most playful, but read in sequence they tend to become a tad formulaic (several robots are sent on a mission; each fails, but the last one succeeds). And if you're a lover of science jokes, these stories will be your playground; Lem packs references to chemistry, physics, geology, computer science, and electronics--often in the same sentence: "self-motes came from distant lands, like the two Automatts, vector-victors in a hundred battles, or like Prostheseus, constructionist par excellence, who never went anywhere without two spark absorbers, one black, the other silver; and there was Arbitron Cosmoski, all built of protocrystals and svelte as a spire...."

If, like me, you prefer a little more story and a little less pun, you'll find that the gems of the book are the three bonus tracks. The last two, in particular, are among the best I've ever read by Lem, and have nothing in common with the fables other than the automaton theme. "The Hunt" is a rollicking adventure story featuring Lem's famous alter ego, Pirx the Pilot, on a mission to destroy a homicidal robot. "The Mask" may well be the best Lem story I've read: the haunting stream-of-consciousness of a robot who, like an otherworldly Tristram Shandy, narrates its own birth, consciousness, self-realization, metamorphosis, rebellion, and--above all--its futile pursuit of love. The opening pages have a deceptively languid pace, until the robot sheds its "mask" (in a surprisingly squeamish scene) and, during the ensuing chase, reveals its lethal assignment. These last stories are worth the price of the whole book. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU6473O2S25FB/[D. Cloyce Smith]

*****
Here Stanislaw Lem embarks on a pretty unique method of satire - reviews of nonexistent books. Most interestingly, Lem takes the opportunity to advance his own ideas on technology, ethics, and logic while satirizing both writers and the literary criticism establishment. Getting a grip on these multiple levels of satire is the key to understanding Lem's purpose in this book. In several "reviews" here, he skewers literary criticism by pretending to be an exaggerated version of an academic critic, first by criticizing his own nonexistent longwinded introduction to this book, then by over-analyzing his fictitious books to the point of solipsism. Examples include critiques of a book that is apparently about nothing and another book in a language spoken by neither the writer nor the critic. All the while, Lem satirizes the ridiculousness of such endeavors with ironically overblown professor-isms like "The self-novel is a partial striptease; the antinovel, ipso facto, is (alas) a form of autocastration." Just like you would find in any literary critique written by a professor wishing to impress no one but another professor - a phenomenon that deserves to be satirized.

Lem also "reviews" several fictitious books that adapt the themes and plotlines of old classics to modern settings, which in the real world is the type of literary reinvention that is often slavishly over-praised by academic analysts - making Lem's satire necessary in bringing all these eggheads back down to Earth. In other "reviews" here, Lem provides commentary on the fictitious scientific and philosophical theories of his fake writers, providing him with a very sneaky method of advancing his always interesting thoughts on those same topics. Meanwhile, some brutal social satire (an underappreciated strength of many of Lem's proper novels) pops up in his "reviews" of fictitious fictional works. This book often seems to be the work of boring over-analytical ivory-tower scientists and snobs, but that's exactly who Lem is satirizing, in a sly fashion that would probably go right over their lofty heads. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SEPMKX5MYZQ6/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810117339[doomsdayer520]

*****
If, like me, your only real exposure to the works of Polish science-fiction author Stanislaw Lem is Solaris, The Cyberiad will likely throw you for a bit of a loop. Solaris is a moody, philosophical, complex work about human longing and loss, using the trappings of science-fiction to tell a story about love and death. So when it turns out that The Cyberiad is a collection of comedic, goofy stories about robots and inventors - and that they're not only genuinely funny, but wildly and comically inventive - well, that wasn't what I expected. But it certainly didn't keep me from thoroughly enjoying every wonderfully weird page of this collection.

The stories in The Cyberiad revolve around Trurl and Klapaucius, two of the greatest inventors of the universe, and their various competitions, journeys into the universe, rivalries, and more. What this allows Lem to do is make a wide variety of stories, all of which touch on rich ideas about cybernetic intelligence and the nature of self, all within deeply comic, even silly frameworks. In one, Trurl makes the dumbest computer of all time, and then has to run from it when it refuses to believe that 2 and 2 don't make 3; in another, Trurl and Klapaucius encounter the famed "PHT" pirate, only to discover that he's actually a PHD pirate who wants knowledge, and demands the inventors make him something that can feed his desire for more information.

Trying to convey the plots of any of these stories is a fool's errand, to put it mildly; the closest thing I can sometimes compare this to is Voltaire's Candide, where the sheer inventiveness of the silliness can provide its own joy, even as it sometimes makes the plots wonderfully incomprehensible. And while The Cyberiad isn't as insightful as Candide (or Solaris), that doesn't mean that the collection doesn't have a lot to say. Whether it's exploring man's desire to dominate others through technology or the appeal of stories or wondering what the Highest Possible Level of Development of life in the universe can be, Lem has no shortage of ideas and thoughts about the world, and his stories allow him to play around with his ideas in ways that encourage thought while still focusing on just having fun. And if you can't appreciate a world in which someone creates a machine that can make absolutely anything, as long as it begins with the letter "n," well, I don't know what to tell you. But it was a genuinely fun read, and a different side of Lem than what I knew existed. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P742GD83CGFN/[Josh Mauthe]

I purchased the hardback version and I am very pleased. The authors have made an excellent job of translating Leopardi's biblical Zibaldone in English. Having gone through some sections of the original Italian version I soon realized that the enchanting aspect of Leopardi's style had not been lost. His contrived arguments still provoke a subtle need to unravel and unlock his most intimate thoughts on an infinite variety of subjects, from classical to modern literature, science and philosophy, all wrapped up in a melancholic veil characteristic of the anticipation of the postmodern era.

The index provides the necessary information to navigate through the 2000 pages of writings, by classifying each of Leopardi's entries by subject (e.g. Love, Life, War, Homer, etc.). - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7ZLKC9IECYYI/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374296820[SteveC78]

[[Satan_His_Psychotherapy]]
*Satan: His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, J.S.P.S.* (1983)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"Old cynic that I am (what new can be said about sin?) this is better than I dared hope - philosophical laff-fest (I would say metaphysical but I don't want to fluster the dovecote) that leaves peers Elkin(S), Friedman(BJ), Charyn(J) (The Tar Baby, anyone? omigod, he's still writing!) in the starting blocks. Though I note that Dalkey Archive are reissuing the former; hmm. Anyway, try this:

'The *unavoidable* evil of lust..leads, as night follows day, to the *understandable* evil of infidelity, and consequently to the *unfortunate* evil of divorce, a commonplace reaction to the *necessary* evil of marriage...So it is, I hear tell, that the Great Magnet of Necessary Evil draws into its field all other indicretions which become charged with necessity. Very neat, I think.' And didn't he set it up well?

Leven gets in digs at that noxious film Cuckoo's Nest and the preposterous Woody Allen, but mostly he has you and me in his sights with our preposterous pretensions. Who said satire was dead? Oh, I did actually. But there's so much in this book - think CS Lewis batting for the opposition. My British 1984 Panther edition's retro sci-fi cover with slippery Allen Jones-style female strikes deliciously the wrong note - or does it? In a world such as that outlined above, can sex ever be gratuitous - or is it ever anything else? Perhaps the act can be trivialised, the urge never. 'There in no passion so serious as lust' (Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy) Though I have to say the actual sex SCENES here depicted are as gratuitous as they come (no pun intended) and written in cartoonish car manual-ese; 'Lupa's v clamped onto K's organ, causing him the greatest pain man has so far acquired the physiology to suffer' probably marks the book's, if not our hapless antihero's, nadir, but by p380 (like sex itself) you'll likely be past caring." - Simon Barrett

*****
"As he did with Creator and Satan's Psychotherapy and Cure, Jeremy Leven has once again created pure magic with this hilarious, moving, and thought-provoking tale of a man who abandons all to search for Perfect Love. And what could be more perfect to love than the Messiah, who now reappears in the prophesied Second Coming as a knockout young female. Declared to be the God of All Gods, She (her name is, in fact, She) beckons our protagonist, the somewhat bewildered Max Pincus, on a journey which is part Canterbury Tales and part, it becomes increasingly evident, a tongue-in-cheek reworking of the New Testament, from virgin birth to Sermon on the Mount, to... well that would give away what Leven has carefully crafted in this extraordinary tale.

Ultimately a love-story, along Pincus's journey to find the new young female Savior, he finds himself attracting a growing cast of self-proclaimed apostles (who, it appears, are neither called nor chosen, but don't especially care), including Rosalie (questionably a - not the - Virgin Mother), Theo Wainwright (an antique dealer who is seeking a satisfactory explanation for the recent passing of his wife of many decades), Sister Gloria Gloria (who keeps the assembly on the most devout spiritual path), Florence (the owner of a New England Bed and breakfast who longs for a life that can be called special), her husband, Sparky (a romantic without the normal bounds one might expect with this designation), his brother, Elliott (along with Sparky, the inventor of the gigantic - and perhaps lethal - Singing Machine, a device with a will of its own and a continually morphing and haunting song which leads all who join Pincus to seek out the new Savior to explain the song's true meaning, dragging the Singing Machine along with them as they go), Meyer Steinmeyer (a philosopher seeking to define with great precision the exact moment a girl becomes a woman and whose nationality and accent seems to change depending on his mood and the weather), and The Thaumaturge (the father of the present Virgin Mother, who may or may not have been responsible for the possibly immaculate conception and who is a fervent anti-synoptic, having an extensive list of reasons why the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are not to be taken seriously).

But it is the budding romance between the Savior and Max Pincus which drives the story, as the so-called apostles attempt to determine whether She is, in fact, the Savior, in which case they have strong reservations about Pincus dating her.
At the end, Leven ingeniously leaves us with a tale which puts us in the midst of what might have been occurring had we been among the original apostles as they encountered the Messiah, and he suggests a world which might have been had the true intentions of the Messiah been realized. It is a comedy of the highest order." - https://www.amazon.com/Savior-Singing-Machine-Comedy/dp/096003532X/[Amazon]

*****
"_Report From Iron Mountain: On the Possibility and Desirability of Peace_ first appeared in 1967 published by The Dial Press and claimed to be a government report compiled by leading scholars who met at Iron Mountain in New York on the possibility and desirability of peace following the Cold War. This edition is published by the Free Press in 1996 and makes the claim that the report itself was a hoax (a spoof on think tank jargon) and was written by Leonard C. Lewin. However, whether or not the report is actually a hoax is difficult to determine, as disinformation is a speciality of the government agencies which release such reports. It should be noted though that even if the report itself is a hoax, that it nevertheless represents the kind of thinking that is typical of the elites. Unfortunately, in the Introduction to this book, written by Victor Navasky, we are treated to the usual establishment apologetics with much fustian about "paranoid ultraright conspiracy theorists", "militiamen", and "right wing libertarian weirdos". Such commentary is all-too-typical and should be simply ignored by anyone who has a working brain and dares to think outside the box. The report itself composes the majority of this book, followed by an afterword by the "author" and some appendices on the "Iron Mountain Affair". It is alleged that when L.B.J. discovered that this report had been "leaked" that he "hit the roof". And, this represents the typical reaction of government officials to those who dare to challenge their reigning hegemony.

The report claims for itself to have been received by Leonard C. Lewin from one "John Doe", who leaked the report to him after it was compiled by 15 leading scholars who met in secret. (Later, Lewin would claim that the entire thing was a hoax and that he wrote the report himself. Whether or not this is accurate is of course difficult to determine.) The report claims that it represents a sort of "peace games" study similar to the "war games" played by the Rand Corporation. The report claims to be a study examining the central issue of the transformation of American society from one in which there is a constant readiness to make war to one in which peace would be sustainable. However, the findings of this report are such that a lasting peace is neither desirable nor sustainable that is most disturbing. Following the Cold War (under constant threat of turning "hot"), the United States entered a period in which disarmament became an option. The author(s) first consider various scenarios under which disarmament may occur, including effects of disarmament on the economy (potentially highly negative). The author(s) next consider war and peace as social systems. Following this, they turn to a discussion of the functions of war. The first function of war is economic, in the sense that the author(s) claim that rather than being a "drain" or producing "waste", war actually vitalizes the economy and provides protection against depressions. The second function of war is political, in the sense that the author(s) claim that the elimination of war would lead to the elimination of the nation-state and that war provides a safeguard against class conflict. The third function of war is sociological, in the sense that the author(s) claim that war gives rise to social cohesion and serves as a means of controlling social dissidence and destructive antisocial tendencies. The fourth function of war is ecological, in the sense that the author(s) claim that war serves as an evolutionary device for maintaining an ecological balance between human population and the supplies available for its survival. The fifth function of war is cultural and scientific, in the sense that the

author(s) claim that creative arts and scientific and technological progress are made possible by war. Finally, the author(s) include a section entitled "Other", where they consider war as a general social release, war as a generational stabilizer, war as an ideological clarifier, and war as the basis for inter-national understanding. The author(s) then consider substitutes for the functions of war. These include economic (social-welfare expenditures, the problem of unemployment, health, education, housing, etc.), political (mentioning the possibility of uniting experiences, "alternate enemies" such as space aliens, and the flying saucer phenomenon), sociological (Peace Corps and Job Corps, but also more bizarre phenomena such as human sacrifice among primitive cultures, blood games, and inquisitions), ecological (birth control and eugenics), and cultural and scientific (creative arts, science, and space-related research). The author(s) conclude that each of these substitutes is fraught with difficulties and thus it will be necessary to continue maintenance of government control over war and peace.

This report is infamous for what it has to say about the possibilities of peace. It would seem that the author(s) (noted high government officials and scholars of repute) believe that a lasting peace is neither possible nor desirable. For those who doubt this on the other hand, it would appear that such officials cynically manipulate the public so as to consolidate their own power within the military-industrial complex. If war is indeed a sort of "make-work" project similar to the Great Pyramids of ancient Eygpt, then it remains to be seen whether or not a lasting peace cannot be achieved. This book is highly recommended for those who seriously consider the possibilities of war and peace. Despite the fact that it is alleged to be a hoax, it nevertheless has much to say to us about the thinking and direction in which the global elites intend to take us." - https://www.amazon.com/review/RIH4XG6JPXW17/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm[New Age of Barbarism]

*****
This is a gem of a book, but it's a rarified thing. We live today in a world of fiction that has been heavily influenced by movies and television. Today's fiction assumes we have no prior knowledge, and it spoon-feeds us everything we need for the purposes of getting through to the end. In the past, however, books were frequently written with the assumption of a great deal of external knowledge. A trivial example of this is the use of Latin tags: it assumes (i) the reader knows Latin, and (ii) the reader knows the entire work from which the tag is taken. A writer, using this device, can create ironic counterpoint. But of course it doesn't work at all if the reader doesn't know Latin and doesn't recognize the tag.

Likewise with The Evolution Man. Unless you come to it with a great deal of external knowledge, much of it is just flat and not funny at all. This is a book full of bone-dry English wit, not in-your-face jokes. It was written by a highly educated writer for his own amusement and that of his friends, all of whom had equivalent knowledge to his own. The jokes, therefore, worked for this audience and continue to work for readers whose range of knowledge is equivalent. But for everyone else, "fugeddabahdit."

For those readers who do appreciate the quasi-Dickensian counterpoint between erudite language and physical squalor, the conceit of a sub-human worrying about his exact location in geological time and possessing a consciousness of the need always to evolve, always to think of the next big thing, this is a wonderfully funny book. It combines several critiques of then-current sociological and psychological dogma with a perceptive view of the different kinds of human motivation and the outcomes they predicate. It also shows clearly how technological progress is a slow and sequential thing: until you have fire you can't have hardened spear-tips; until you have hardened spear-tips you can't have arrows, and therefore bows. There's a ladder of necessary preconditions for any advance, and the author gently leads us up this ladder. By doing so, the book give us pause to consider the wretched condition of prehistoric hominids and prompts us to be profoundly grateful to all the nameless innovators stretched out across time whose creations enable us to live warm, secure and comfortable lives. And the book accomplishes all of this and more in a style that is a delight to read. We see Uncle Vanya railing against progress when his brother creates the domestic fire - and Vanya rails most often against this unnatural innovation when the nights are cold and damp. Likewise Vanya protests against the unnaturalness of cooking meat before eating it, and comes to protest repeatedly as his teeth fail him and his digestive system can no longer cope with the roots and tough vegitation that formerly constituted his natural diet. Points are made with subtle humor throughout the book, which is its main charm. Nothing is belaboured.

But this is not a book for the casual reader, for whom it will largely be disappointing. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZXUZROE8RUDK/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679750096[Allan M. Lees]

He has been a philosopher, but his writing-style was more comfortable to any reader, than the work of the other German genius of that time: Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Lichtenberg loved the ideas of the French Enlightenment and he tried to explain the ideas of empiric science with humor. He was critical against Christian dogmatics. He once shortly noted: "An Amen face." Or longer: "Nothing offers me such clear proof of how things stand in the world of learning than the circumstance that Spinoza was for so long regarded as an evil, worthless person and his opinions as dangerous." Lichtenberg has been a philosopher - but writing with esprit. If you can tolerate his bile, buy his book: "Who has two pairs of trousers turn one of them into cash and purchase this book." But bear in mind: "A book is a mirror: if an ape looks into it, - an apostle is unlikely to look out!" - http://www.amazon.com/review/RGY18LROM9KWZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322501&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[FrizzText]

*****
"I would argue that Paradiso is the best novel of the 20th century. I don't believe this because of the plot; as a matter of fact, I don't really think there is much of a plot here. I say it because of factors that have to do with the author, the time in which he wrote this, and how those elements combined to make this incredible piece of literature.

A little bit of history: by the time Lezama Lima wrote this novel, he was already a well-known writer in Cuba. He and some friends had started a literary magazine, and actually, he was best known for his poetry. When Castro's revolution came to be in 1959, it marked the end of Cuba's literary life. Writers like Lezama Lima could keep writing so long as they wrote nothing controversial, nothing too "out there," nothing that could even hint a thought of anything that could be deemed "counter-revolutionary." And soon after Lezama Lima wrote Paradiso.

Now a little bit about the novel. Consider it, really, a long, endless conversation with many, many asides. It is complex if only because there are so many run-on sentences, so many thoughts and descriptions and details, that it's easy to lose track and just find yourself thinking, period. And I think that's what he was going for. The book covers just about everything: politics, ethics, philosophy, homosexuality, love, religion, etc. I thought when I read it that basically Lezama Lima just wanted to express his thoughts and opinions on everything (I later learned I was pretty correct about that, but more on that in a minute). What this brilliant man had to say is well-worth reading, even today.

But now, let's go back to the time and place when this was written. A few years after Castro came into power, and after he had declared his Communist intentions. With the publication of this novel, Lezama Lima's fate was sealed. As a homosexual man living in a country with a severely homophobic dictator, life had already been getting more and more difficult for him. But when Paradiso came out, he was officially declared "non-person" by the regime. For those unfamiliar with the concept, I will explain that being declared "non-person" essentially means just that: you cease to exist in the eyes of the government. You are erased from the history books, from the record books, you lose your job, people who visit you or have anything to do with you risk losing their government freebies and suffering reprisals. Lezama Lima was no longer a national literary treasure, and the man who up until that moment was considered one of the most respected writers in Latin America, was reduced to nothing.

I had the honor of meeting his younger sister a short while ago. She was sharing the contents of private letters between her and her brother from the years after the publication of Paradiso to those before his death. They revealed so much about Lezama Lima as a person, how he saw life, how he regarded his family (all of whom were in exile and whom he missed terribly). They reveal his gentleness, the tenderness he felt about nature, his family, his memories. And they also reveal the hell that his life had become: the loneliness, the constant vigilance, the pain he felt over what had become of his country.

Being privy to such an experience really only affirmed my thoughts about this novel. He must have known what lay in store for him, and yet it didn't stop him. He still wrote it. When the government demanded that he denounce his own book, the one he considered his masterpiece, his message to the world, in essence, he refused. It simply fills me with awe. For that alone the book is worth reading." - https://www.amazon.com/review/R31JDWM7ZAP1JJ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm[Tere]

*****
One of the best books of the 20th century. Limonov stirs up a poet's rage against everything that is anti-human, everything that is repressive and stifling . . . His solution - tear it all down. Eddie-Baby leaves the USSR for America with promises of riches, women, drugs, and artistic liberty. He finds abject poverty, his wife leaves him, wine and vodka still suffice, and unique voices are marginalized as much in America as they are in Russia; in short, nothing changes. Passion and love are juxtaposed with the rote boredom of work and urban life. Along the way, Limonov takes aim at political activists, Russians, Americans, men, women, and especially our predilection to surrender to life. He rarely misses his mark . . . The sentiment is close to that one found in the romantics, especially the 19th century rebellion against urbanity and the industrial mode of life.

There's a short section early in the book where Limonov accuses his reader of being a slave to work, of having a petty bourgeois mentality, and a pathetic soul. This is capped off by the admonition, "You're ****!" [apologize for amazon's filter] It's hard to disagree, put in those terms. With Eddie as my accuser, I'd confess to anything . . .

Ignore the reviewers who are shocked by Limonov's provocations. What is shocking is not sleeping with a black man on the street, but living a beige life in the face of so much possibility.

For those interested, Limonov's politics also show an early alignment with national bolshevism and a repudiation of anglo liberalism. We see somewhat weaker critiques of the early Bolsheviks, and especially a condemnation of the post-Khrushchev Russian bureaucratic state.

Limonov's prose has a tendency to reach hysterical levels of emotion; whether this is a good or bad mark will probably depend on the reader. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R35QNT4ISJ9RT0/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802130070&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[John J. Christy]

*****
"Limonov's best novel. After the explosive It's Me Eddie he learned how to construct a story and overall this book is less uneven and immature than his more famous debut. It lacks the poetic quality of his Diary of a Loser but still has its moments of elevated language within a more traditional structure. In this book Eddie has become a butler/housekeeper for a Manhattan millionaire and spends most of his week taking care of a townhouse while the owner is away. He's snobby and angry but you can't help but like him most of the time. The plot is a bit thin but the figure of its protagonist is interesting enough to make it a story worth reading. It is based on Limonov's real life experiences, though how much actually happened and how much comes from his imagination is something that critics and academics have spilled a lot of ink on without sorting out. Great for anyone who liked his work in the eXile or is interested in the Third Wave of Russian emigration to the U.S." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R200I7D3QKV3FS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394556070[Amazon Customer]

"This is an account of Limonov's adolescence in Kharkov, a provincial Soviet city, in the years after Stalin's death. But Limonov's hero Eddie-Baby is nothing at all like the Russian heroes English-speaking readers have come to expect and his Kharkov is nothing at all like the tightly-policed USSR we usually encounte in emigre novels. In Eddie Baby's Kharkov, there is no law. Police are goons, and the quickest way to become a legend in the housing projects of Saltovka is to beat up a cop. Eddie-Baby is a nearsighted brain who decides, at the age of eleven, to become a hooligan--and does so with the same quiet, scary determination which once led him to fill notebooks with data on the fauna of the tropics. He devotes himself to learning the rules of his punk/proletarian world with a slightly crazed pedantry, and takes the reader along with him through one holiday weekend in this astounding, completely unknown habitat: the steel jungles of the Soviet nine-floor housing projects.

But the book is by no means gritty or grimy, or any of those silly words reviewers use to describe urban descriptions. In Eddie-Baby's mind, his world is a forest, full of ogres and prey--and all of it is worthy of caressing, precise description. He makes you love this world. There are paragraphs in this book I've read something like ten thousand times, they are so perfect. A middleaged lecher pouring a glass of vodka; a gang beating a pedestrian to death; a precise account of the sort of glue and paper you need to break a window quietly for a burglary; Limonov invests every one of these moments from a vanished, outlandish world with a calm and uncanny beauty. Get this book at any cost. There is nothing like it in the world." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30HXEJME8YPWL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802110266[John Dolan]

[[Landscape_in_Concrete]]
*Landscape in Concrete* (1963, 2009)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/Landscape-Concrete-Letter-Modern-Classics/dp/1934824143/[Amazon]

*****
The first thing we learn about "Jakov Lind" in Joshua Cohen's introduction is that the author of this 1963 novella (written in German) was, in fact, a man of many names, as well as something of a cipher. He was known, in the records of several long-dead regimes, by at least three other pseudonyms, which Cohen interprets as a sign of "trauma." That is, the inability to ever know oneself as a singular individual, despite Lind's several published autobiographies which are also our only sources of information about him. When Hitler's annexation of his native Austria shattered his close-knit Jewish family, young Heinz Jakov Landwirth was sent with a sister on the Kindertransport to the Netherlands. Infuriated at what he perceived to be the "complacency" of the Dutch Jews, "Jan Overbeek" eventually went underground as a bargeman. After a bout of clap from a prostitute, Overbeek found new work as a personal courier for the German Institute for Metallurgical Research of the Imperial Air Ministry of Traffic. (Posing as a Nazi is really an unconscious act, Lind later said, one merely "nods and obeys, one adapts.") In 1945, "Jakov Chaklan," Palestinian Jew (!), left for Israel, where life on a kibbutz merely annoyed him, as did religion. He then made his way back to London, where he would remain until his death in 2007. Throughout his life, "Jakov Lind" would hold many occupations, including photographer, fruit-picker, air-traffic controller, actor, private detective, journalist, and literary/film agent. He was married twice.

"Landscape in Concrete," Lind's famous tale of tragedy and absurdity, concerns one Gauthier Bachman, a giant oaf of a German soldier who is also the sole survivor of a regiment that got drowned in mud. He is subsequently declared mentally unfit to serve. But Bachman's ardent determination to support the Fatherland's war effort is undiminished and, having been released/escaped from a Polish sanitarium, he has now begun a quest to locate and join any regiment willing to take him. Along the way, however, instead of an idealized mission of duty and purpose, he is repeatedly abused, manipulated, and humiliated into acting in ways contrary to both his nature and (supposedly) that of civilized society. From Peter von Göritz, the stylish homosexual sergeant, to murderous psychopath Hjalmar Halftan and lecherous police chief Heinz-Otto Muschel, a dominant running theme is the corruption of power and the frightening ways in which authority figures can use it to influence their subordinates. (Similarly, in Stanley Krubrick's film "Dr. Strangelove," it is unanimously agreed that Colonel Jack Ripper has gone completely nuts, yet no one seems to question the psychological health of General Buck Turgidson, who delights in spectacularly destructive military action.) "[A]fter all," says Cohen, "the Holocaust was legal, as are most wars." In other words, as "Landscape in Concrete" also makes quite clear, the definition of sanity and criminal behavior depends purely on context.

The perversion of language and distortion of meaning in "Landscape in Concrete" is also reminiscent of Joseph Heller's 1961 novel "Catch-22" (also about World War II). Both books explore the illogical madness of war and the cognitive dissonance inherent to its various acts of institutionalized horror. Heller's hero Yossarian is told that, in order to be discharged from duty he must be proven mentally unfit (like Bachman). Unfortunately, the very act of trying to be discharged is indicative of a sound mind, as no normal human being would ever want to go into combat. Likewise, when Bachman begs to be reinstated despite his many issues, he is told that a "war can only be fought with sound men. The highest demands are made on every individual, it takes nerves of steel. We have to do things that may not be to our liking. Yes, sometimes we have to do violence to our own nature. Most of the duties a war imposes on us, Sergeant Bachman, are revolting, let's face it, insane, and yet the soldier who performs them has to fully responsible." The collapse of solid meaning in language is visualized through Bachman's distaste for the chaos of trees, rocks, and mountains, as well as his desire for the transformation of the natural landscape into one of concrete: flattened, paved-over, bombed to oblivion. All he wants to do is serve his nation and obey his orders, but it is this naive yearning that is gradually transforming him into a monster at the hands of others.

Though undeniably thought-provoking, "Landscape in Concrete" is also a very intense tale that can be difficult to read. I was even forced to skip a couple of pages during the scene in which Halftan has Bachman murder a family simply because it got so gruesome. Overall, Lind is certainly a talented writer whose narrative shifts smoothly between horror and pitch black humor. A common literary criticism is that a particular book could have been shorter; here, however, I feel that "Landscape in Concrete" probably should have been longer, especially given the comparatively weak third act where I felt the storyline became rather confused. (Like, what was the deal with the lesbian-landlord-gynecologist? That weird little subplot just had me going, "Huh?") "Landscape in Concrete" is nevertheless an important literary addition to library of World War II and Holocaust writings, as it forces the reader to both sympathize with and revile a hapless protagonist-turned-"criminal" and demands that we examine within ourselves that same capacity for mindless, befuddled obedience.

Also recommended: Victor Serge's "Unforgiving Years" and Tod Strasser's "The Wave." - https://www.amazon.com/review/R2FH1KNI7WA9JM/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934824143&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E. L. Fay]

*Soul of Wood* (1964, 2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
"I had, consecutively, been a sailor on a tugboat, an assistant to a spy, an employee in a food rationing office, a fisherman in the Mediterranean, a road worker in Jerusalem, a beach photographer in Tel Aviv...". Jakov Lind's capsule autobiography, of which this is only a part, omits his separation from his parents and escape from Vienna to Holland on a Kindertransport after the Anschluss, or the fact that the first three of these jobs were conducted in Nazi Germany, a Jew hiding in the enemy camp under a false name.

Normally, I do not bother with an author's biography before reading his works, but Lind's case is different, because his wild, surreal, grotesque stories are only explicable -- perhaps only tolerable -- in the light of his own suffering and bizarre escape. One of the six shorter stories in this book, "Hurrah for Freedom," concerns a family of refugees from the Soviet Union who live together in an overheated barn, obese and naked, delightedly dining on their own children. Even freedom can exact too high a price. Cannibalism appears in one of the other stories too, as does a mass murderer, a former SS officer turned Jesuit priest without losing his taste for seduction, and a sleepless man's midnight encounter with God.

The title story, the longest in the book, is basically a novella. It is not hard to see Jakov's own background in the opening situation of two Jewish parents departing by train for Poland, leaving their paralyzed son in the care of the one-legged WW1 veteran whom they have paid to look after him in secret. The veteran keeps his promise and conveys to boy to a hut in the mountains. But then the story turns surreal, as the boy undergoes a sudden transformation that can perhaps be understood as a metaphor for Jakov's own escape. Meanwhile, the focus shifts to the veteran who, well-meaning but weak, is inextricably drawn into participation in the Nazi killing machine. Then, with the war coming to a close, it becomes valuable to produce a Jew whose life has been saved, so he heads back to the mountain....

But the most penetrating of these stories -- I won't say my favorite, since none of them can be called enjoyable -- may be the last, "Resurrection." Here is the arresting opening: "'Deum Jesum Christum in gloriam eternam est. Nu.' Goldschmied turned over on the other side, put down the prayer book, and tried to sleep." We are back in a place that Jakov Lind must have known well, a sealed-up closet in a boarding house in Holland. Goldschmied, who has been baptized a Christian and clings to his new faith like a life-line, is forced to share his hiding hole with a Jew named Weintraub, who is a liability because he is sick with tuberculosis. The dialogues between them about faith and the price of freedom go deeper than the Kafkaesque grotesquerie of the shorter stories. And the title comes to mean more than their release from the coffin-like closet. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZIHTHEKA17HO/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590173309&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful[Roger Brunyate]

*Ergo* (1966, 2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Ergo-Jakov-Lind/dp/1934824178/[Amazon]

*****
If you aren't smirking as you read, if you aren't chuckling often and guffawing at least every third page, throw this book away! It's not for you! It's a book that assumes a lot, perhaps unjustifiably, about your prior readings and meditations. It doesn't merely allude to Spinoza and bowdlerize Wittgenstein; it presupposes that you will recognize what is being mocked and relish the mockery. Being and Non-Being! Sense and Nonsense! ossia Being and Nonsense! Sense and Non-Being! It's nonsense that sense exists in a nonsensical world; ergo existence is nonsense. Which is to say, it's sense that no non-nonsensical world can exist. Capisce? "Ergo" is a relentless commedia dell'arte in which the fools are philosophers and the philosophers -- the existential philosophers queued up from Spinoza to "You yourself, dear reader" -- are scabrous parasitic dangerous fools.

However, relentless mockery does wear out its welcome, no? Spott und Gäste stinken nach drei Tagen. Derisione e gli ospiti dopo tre giorni puzzano. La moquerie et les invités puent au bout de trois jours. There's the same proverb in every language, although the first word is normally "Fish." Okay, on the off chance that you stop smiling as you read, it's likely that you've lost the thread or the mood. Lay it aside. The nastiness of Nazism will keep festering and Jakov Lind's scorn for the cataclysmic side-effects of Idealismus will, I fear, become ever more persuasive as our lives blab on. Pick the book up in ten days, or ten years; it gets funnier as you don't read it.

However, if you are inherently an earnest reader who wants to think she/he is getting the message as he/she reads, I'd suggest looking at Lind's English-language autobiography before confronting "Ergo."

*****
There would be stiff competition for that title -- Emperor PuYi, Sir Ewan Forbes, Howard Hughes, to name a few contenders -- but none of them would rival Jakov Lind at the art of making a strange life even stranger in the telling of it. Lind was the author, in German, of some of the most disturbing Holocaust fictions -Soul of Wood (New York Review Books)- of the century, despite the fact that he hated the German language and professed ecstatic release when he eventually mastered the confidence to write in English. "Counting My Steps" was his first English-language book, written in London in 1968, three chapters of autobiography of three different personages: Heinz Jakov Landwirth, born in 1927 in Vienna, an 11-year old Jewish boy whose parents had immigrated to Palestine before Germany annexed Austria, who found precarious refuge in Holland; Jan Gerrit Overbeek, who survived inside Nazi Germany by assuming a Dutch identity and working on a barge transporting goods between Holland and Germany, evading both the SS and the allied bombings; and Jakov Chaklan, who impostured his way to Palestine, married, fathered a son, moved to Vienna for three years and finally settled in London, where he wrote in German the stories and novels on which his stature as a writer is based.

Like all autobiographies, "Counting My Steps" stops of necessity in mid-life, though if any autobiographer could ever write his final chapter posthumously, it would be Jakov Lind. The photo of Lind on the dust jacket of "Counting My Steps" looks a lot like Kurt Vonnegut masquerading as Groucho Marx. It's an apt image. In German, Lind was relentlessly grim; Lind in English is a waggish self-satirist, a writer who knows that his truths are stranger than fiction, who is simultaneously shameless and guilt-ridden about his survival. He has been, in effect, kidnapped from each of his three former selves and thus liberated to confess his own human absurdity. He might well have titled his book "Three Ways of Being Jewish in the Twentieth Century Without Matzoh-Ball Chicken Soup," a kooky monologue bedizened with profound speculations about "identity" and "belief." That it's also a tale of audacious survival simply adds zest to the reading. Hollywood should recognize a blockbuster film to be made from the adventures of "Jan Gerrit Overbeek" on the Rhine, with Ben Stiller pretending not to be Jewish and getting away with it. - https://www.amazon.com/Counting-My-Steps-J-Lind/dp/0025723901/[Gio]

[[Parallel_Botany]]
*Parallel Botany* (1978)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Botany-Leo-Lionni/dp/0394733029/[Amazon]

*****
Leo Lionni created a baffling, even maddening, encyclopedic compendium that describes, illustrates, arrays, and summarizes a host of imaginary plants---his parallel botany. Besides the detailed descriptions of these odd plants, Mr. Lionni, who is best known for his various children's books, rendered numerous illustrations of the various parallel plants. But he doesn't stop here: 23 figures and photographs of various scientists, researchers, explorers and parallel plants together paired with another 32 plates or charcoal or pencil drawings fortify the seeming reality of the world of parallel botany. (Keep in mind that a number of these plants are not visible.) The end notes to the chapters add more authenticity, and I assume, that many of the publications cited are real. The only component lacking is an index.

There are layers and layers of complexity to this spoof, for Mr. Lionni draws the reader into more than the facts and lore of his creations by also intertwining issues about philosophy, language, and the scientific method. He presents multiple points of view bantered by experts in this subject matter, and this debate enlivens the discussion. He firmly roots the research by drawing upon imaginary but real-sounding folk tales and legends, made more real by invoking actual historical figures. Hence, imaginary notes from Magellan's historian or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus are dissected and scrutinized for clues and encounters with various specimens from the realm of parallel plants. Such luminaries as the Swiss biologist Max Spinder or the Greek botanist Professor Spyros Rodokanankis, and many more, espouse their various theories and findings, often disagreeing about their findings and the implications of their research.

His methods remind one of both Borges and Lovecraft, two masters at creating real-sounding imaginary worlds supported by tier upon tier of crafted scholarship and science.

This book is unique and arguably the last, and the only, word on the subject of parallel botany. Some consider it hilarious, others a mere spoof, but certainly it is more than that, for Mr. Lionni expended considerable effort and time to document this imaginary segment of the plant kingdom. The fact that a major publisher issued the book in hardback suggests someone thought highly of this idea.

I take away a sense of astonishment at the amount of detail invoked to underscore the verisimilitude of the premise, and see this book as a wry jab at the reductionistic tendencies of a scientific method that seems at times to value cataloging over understanding our world.

(I also once had a vision many years ago that may have come from whatever source Mr. Lionni tapped for Parallel Botany, a vision of an asylum that housed crazed and dangerous plants that I rendered in an oil painting a friend of mine smuggled into the art gallery in the Saturn Bar down in New Orleans.) - http://www.amazon.com/review/RYS15Q8RCHASG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394733029&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[loce_the_wizard]

*****
"FIRST published in Italy as La botanica parallela, this illustrated "non-fact" work is presented as popular science. It earnestly expounds the oddities of an elusive, frequently invisible, and wholly imaginary plant kingdom that coexists with botany as we know it.

Parallel plants exhibit "masslessness," seem frozen in time, lack internal structure, and generally collapse to dust at a human touch. Some defy the laws of perspective. When visible, their coloration tends to be "a gamut of blacks." The latest, still unclassified discovery is black but casts luminous shadows.

Tirils, resembling dense-packed fields of grissini, include species that emit strange whistles, strangle one another, or implant themselves disturbingly in the memory like Jorge Luis Borges' Zahir. Woodland Tweezers' distribution patterns echo positions in the game of Go. Giraluna the moonflower, once perhaps "an aerial plant," is naturally visible only by moonlight.

The list goes on. Protorbis, the "parallel mushroom," varies in size from infinitely small to infinitely large; specimens have been mistaken for mesas. The Labirintiana lure ants into elaborate mazes embossed on their leaves. The Artisia echo the styles of human artforms—"Nature imitating Art"—and one species of Camponara looks uncannily like a menorah. The various convoluted forms of Solea are most plausibly decoded as music.…

Parallel Botany is full of teasing paradox and baffled scientists. Neat invented folktales from Africa, Russia, and other countries suggest that our ancestors knew of these non-plants. Overall, though, Lionni's tongue-in-cheek descriptions of weirdness become a trifle repetitive. Borges would have deftly condensed all this imaginary science into a review of an imaginary book." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2007/cur0712.htm[David Langford]

Subtitled "A Joke Book," Lish's Extravaganza follows Jewish comedy
team Smith and Dale through a series of jokes, sometimes short and to
the point, sometimes lengthy and "shaggy doggish". Along the way
we see into the family lives of the two men, lives which also seem
to be, primarily, fodder for a burlesque act. But occasionally something
else rears its ugly head: antisemitism. Poor Smith and Dale are attacked
as "f*cking kikes" by virtually everyone imaginable, including a herring in the lake.
But nothing is capable of derailing their comic responses to life in general. Or is it?

Is Extravaganza an oblique commentary on the Holocaust? Or maybe just on Holocaust fiction? Is it a recreation of the prejudice many Jews have
experienced as a part [but not the whole] of their lives? I, for one, am not smart enough to answer those questions.

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802143202/[Amazon]

*****
This is Dustin Long's first novel Icelander and I can't recommend this book highly enough. Although the premise is slightly confusing, you are soon caught up in the plot and by page fifty or so it becomes that rarest of things: a literary page-turner. The book focuses partly on the discovery, commercialization, and quest for independence of a fictional underground Icelandic kingdom called Vanaheim. Most of the action, however, takes place in the U.S.A. in upstate New Uruk on "Bean Day," a local celebration of the deceased adventuress Emily Bean, who along with her family discovered Vanaheim. Despite the book's humorous tone, there are a number of surprisingly moving characters - French-Canadian ex-cop Blaise Duplain struggling to come to terms with and solve the murder of his wife; Jon Ymirson an aging adventure hero stricken with Alzheimers; and his daughter "Our Heroine," in a Hamlet-like state of indecision over following in her deceased mother's adventure-seeking footsteps. At many points in the book I laughed out loud or marveled at the author's clever use of language. (Also watch for hidden clues throughout the book). My favorite parts include overly self-conscious actor Nathan, philosophical investigators Wible and Pacheco, the fox-shirted Refurserkir (guardians of Vanaheim), and rogue library scientist Hubert Jörgen. If you love (but don't mind poking fun at) mysteries, Nabokov, Norse mythology, adventure novels, literary pretentiousness, and Hamlet (the Thomas Kyd version) order the book! - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32GHAG17REUS9/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802143202[C.

The Desert recounts, in diary form, Loti’s month-long journey from Cairo to Jerusalem through the Sinai and Petraean deserts in the company of two European companions and twenty or so Bedouin. Translator Jay Paul Minn notes that Loti took the trip both to indulge his obsession with Islam and, hoping to find inspiration in Jerusalem, in an effort to reconcile his atheism with his mother’s Christianity. Rejecting the most commonly traveled routes, Loti opted for the more forbidding, dangerous passage through the Petraean, at the time beleaguered by internecine clashes and conflicts between Arabs and Turks.

"I can't imagine why this book is so very little known when lesser books are famous and considered British comic classics. I learned of it only because a few pages were reproduced in the catalogue for an exhibition devoted to Bataille's journal 'Documents'; Queneau, I then found, had written an essay about it, and I've the impression that it's received more attention from French thinkers than from the English-speaking public. If you do happen to pride yourself upon being a John Bull type--or a Joe Six-Pack--who considers 'French intellectual' a contemptuous term, stick that in your pipe and smoke it. (Mine's a Gauloise, thanks.)

Lucas and Morrow used images from a department-store catalogue to illustrate a cod autobiography. Whilst the book could be read in five or ten minutes, it wants far longer than that to be looked at because, while there's a certain charm and some humour in the words, the appeal of the book lies largely in the illustrations in juxtaposition with the text. The catalogue pictures are used without regard to scale or style: On one page might be a line drawing of an archery target and at the top of the next a fashion plate next to a densely cross-hatched piece of furniture. Flat-irons are used to illustrate swans, a brooch stands in for a bird in flight, and one of the body parts strewn about by a train wreck is a box shaped like a heart. Rum bottles rest on a table that could never support their weight and figures who, given the relative scale, would be giants or midgets pop up often. The story itself seems to be inspired by the pictures, not vice versa--after all, who could resist mentioning a horse with a swollen neck simply in order to display a strikingly inept drawing of a horse with what seems to be the grandaddy of all goitres?

Off-hand, I can't think of another British book whose overall feel is as surrealistic as this one's. Certainly I can't think any such book as old as this one. A little treasure." - monica

Lugones, Leopoldo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Strange_Forces]]
*Strange Forces* (2001)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891270052/[Amazon]

*****
Judging by the personal descriptions of author Leopoldo Lugones that translator Gilbert Alter-Gilbert offers up in his introduction to Strange Forces, Lugones was kind of a crank. I have no problem with that; I like cranks, even ones who are "inflexibly doctrinaire," "histrionic, vain, and precocious from infancy," and a "systematic bore," or who pal around with military cabals and oligarchs and change philosophical and religious ideologies as if they were underwear. It's all forgivable--provided one can produce superb fiction. And though it's admittedly unfair to judge Lugones on the basis of one collection of short stories--even a collection that had a significant influence on Borges--I came away from Strange Forces more bored by the crank than awed by the author.

Strange Forces contains 12 stories, and it's a qualitatively motley group, short on humor and atmosphere and long on pedantic, quasi-scientific theorizing. Unlike Algernon Blackwood, Edgar Allan Poe, or similar authors to whom he's been compared, Lugones is more interested in postulating occult theories than in setting a mood that might just make those theories believable. The result is that many stories in Strange Forces contain an exhaustive setup and short anticlimax. In his introduction, Alter-Gilbert tries to place the by-now threadbare mantle of "prescience" on Lugones' shoulders by ascribing to him an anticipation of the "destructive potential of science," despite the fact that the same thing is said of virtually every science fiction author from Verne to Huxley. Such authors can keep their prescience. I'd rather have a little pleasure.

So what is there to like about Strange Forces? Well, The Pillar of Salt, the book's penultimate story, was the only piece that made me "read with my spine," as Nabokov has so nicely put it. It's about an aged Armenian monk and his encounter with a pilgrim who suggests the potential redemption of Lot's wife. Viola Acherontia, the tale of a gardener who wants to create a "flower of death," carries its pseudo-scientific setup to a creepy conclusion. And the final story, Psychon, features a startlingly whimsical and genuinely funny ending in which a little subconscious lunacy creeps out from beneath the intellectual decadence.

Ultimately, my impression was that Lugones, who took his own life after being spurned by an "immortal girl" 30 years his junior, was in love with the sound of his own voice--or more precisely, the cleverness of his own thoughts. Then again, perhaps he was just a true believer, madly (and I do mean madly) trying to convince his audience of the likelihood of his latest theory. As Alter-Gilbert writes, "The difference between Lugones and other authors in this line was that for Lugones, his notions of supernatural operations and secret forces were not merely framing devices or dramatic pretexts on which to hang his stories, but actual verities; confirmed truths to which he wholeheartedly subscribed." If so, then God help Gomorrah. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BXG2J2H781S/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1891270052&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Gordon Comstock]

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1859840736/[Amazon]

*****
Professor Caritat (named after the surname of the Optimistic philosopher better known to us as the Marquis de Condorcet), a specialist on the thinkers of the Enlightenment, is a cross between a sophisticated Candide and a Gulliver. He is a citizen of Militaria, a repressive state run by a military dictatorship. He has to flee from that and embarks on a mission to find a state in which the ideas of 18th century philosophers have been applied and to see how these ideas have turned out in practice. He is looking for the best of all possible states. But in each of these countries he gets into trouble, wittily described, and has to move on.

The first country he visits is Utilitaria, which is governed by the ideas of Jeremy Bentham; and a soulless place it is, where there is no place for anything that cannot be proved to be `useful' to its society.

The next country is Communitaria. Its government is committed to total respect and equal treatment for every ethnic and every religious community, but it interprets respect in such a way that any comment which might suggest that one way of living or one set of ideas is superior to another, and every criticism of any group, is severely punished, so it is in effect an extremely intolerant state.

From there Caritat escapes to Proletaria - named, he is told, after the class that had brought it into being, although that class, like all others, has since withered away, as indeed has the state itself.

This turns out to be a phantasmagoria, from which he awakes to find himself in yet another country, Libertaria. Here free enterprise is rampant, every public service is in the process of being privatized, financial extortion is the name of the game, and woe betide those who can't play it. The country seems to be an ally of Militaria: though Libertarian `freedom' is missing there, Militaria's maintenance of `order' is something the Libertarians admire.

Finally, on his way out of that country, the Professor makes it to Minerva, a border town in the North of Libertaria. There he comes to the wise conclusion that what was the matter with all the dystopian states he had visited was that the single-minded pursuit of just one desirable aim (Order, Welfare, Respect, Equality, Freedom of Action) leads to the suppression of all the others. Condorcet had observed that all human ideals are linked together in an indissoluble chain. More practically, Isaiah Berlin (whom Lukes does not name in the text, though he does mention him in the bibliography) has taught that there needs to be a trade-off between all these desirable aims. How to strike this balance must be a never-ending quest, requiring much Wisdom.

One of his interlocutors in Libertaria had told him that people once believed that there was a state called Egalitaria north of their country, but that they had found that it did not exist and was in fact a utopia. Perhaps that is the reason why the book ends in Minerva, with Caritat seeing that just beyond the border is a crossroads from which several roads extended. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL611TQ20CE8S/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1859840736[Ralph Blumenau]

"Otherwise known as the Chronicle of Portents and Prophecies, this book was written in 1557 by the French humanist Conrad Lycosthenes. Laid out like an encyclopedia, the book transcribes otherworldly happenings since the time of Adam and Eve. But while the encyclopedic Codex Seraphinianus was a book of fantasy, Lycosthenes�s Chronicle was relatively factual�at least in the sense that it covered actual reports. Sandwiched in between well-documented disasters, floods, and meteor showers (including Halley�s comet) are descriptions of sea monsters, UFOs, and various biblical themes.

The Chronicle was incredibly detailed and contained over 1,000 original woodcut illustrations of the phenomenon described. There are still several copies floating around, usually on rare book websites, where they sell for several thousands of dollars." - http://listverse.com/2014/03/30/10-of-the-most-bizarre-books-ever-written/[Andrew Handley]

[[The_Face_on_the_Cutting_Room_Floor]]
*The Face on the Cutting Room Floor* (1937)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Face-Cutting-Room-Floor-Cameron-McCabe/[Amazon]

*****
There’s no good reason why a detective story
published in 1937 should be so cussedly postmodern.  
But The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor is just that.
Over the course of 200 pages, our mysterious
author—whose identity
remained a secret until
1974—dishes up enough
intertextual intrigue and meta-
narrative mischief to keep a
Yale graduate seminar busy
for a full semester.  I'm not
surprised that crime fiction
author Julian Symons called
this novel "the detective story
to end all detective stories."

Here readers encounter a text
within a text, a mystery story
that keeps on returning to its own first principles,
a possibly unreliable narrator, and a crazy-quilt
deconstruction of the entire tale akin to what
Roland Barthes attempted in S/Z. The author
of the book inevitably enters the story as a character
—also as a murder suspect. Famous literary critics
are eventually drawn into the mix, where they
offer conflicting opinions in a cascade of
misattributed quotes. Different interpretations of
the text clash and contradict each other—not just
outside the text, but in the very pages of the novel.
The extravagance of the whole is so extreme, that
the reader barely blinks an eyelash when the author
starts comparing his work to James Joyce's Ulysses
and the paintings of Picasso.   

In short, this is a novel that doesn’t want to settle
for being just a novel. It also wants to fill the role
of a commentary on itself, and on the detective
story genre in general.   

The book starts out with no hints of the excesses
to come.  An actress’s body is found in a film
editor's office, the fatal wound either a sign of
suicide or evidence of murder.  But this
straightforward opening gambit soon develops
into a series of maddeningly complex variations.
No fewer than three people step forward to
confess to the murder. Then it turns out that a
camera had filmed the whole event, and the
footage indicates that the actress took her own
life.  Or did she?

But the reader ought not get too focused on this
crime—it’s all just misdirection. The real murder
has yet to take place in this novel. And, yes, there
is a detective, but he falls several notches below
Sherlock Holmes—and, for all we know, might be
a murderer himself.  The fakeouts and stutter steps
continue unabated until the novel’s
conclusion. Even the final page throws a parting
curveball.

The experimental quality of the story coexists with
a great degree of banality.  Many scenes are awkward
and formulaic, almost to an unbearable extreme.
The dialogue often sounds like a bad parody of a
Hollywood crime movie script—and the reader is
not quite sure whether this is a sign of the author's
clumsiness, or part of a deliberate effort to poke
fun at the movie industry.   Many years later, when
the author was identified as Ernest Borneman—
the anglicized name of Ernst Bornemann, a refugee
from Hitler’s Germany who had settled in London—
the real story behind the odd writing emerged:  
Borneman had arrived in his new country knowing
very little English, and was still learning the language
when he wrote The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor.  

Other writers have written books which keep
returning to their own starting points—such as
Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style or Italo
Calvino's If On a Winter's Night a Traveler—but
the mystery genre is especially resistant to retelling
and rereading. Once the reader knows "who
done it," once the puzzle is solved and justice
served, the allure of the story dissipates. But
Borneman delivers a quirky exception to the rule
in The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor, a mystery in
which the same facts are recounted again and
again, yet with a different twist at each retelling.  
According to the author’s own tabulation, the
story is related nine separate times—but even that
admission comes too soon, since at least two more
retellings takes place after the final count—include
one from a dead witness.

Sir Herbert Read commented, when this novel was
first released:  "This thriller is cunningly constructed
on the formula of the Hegelian triad: thesis, antithesis,
synthesis."  The author describes the same effect in
more matter-of-fact terms, explaining that "every time
the story is told you learn more about it, new clues
are discovered, new facts are disclosed, you see the
thing from a new angle."  Yet I’m not so sure—I
suspect that some of these accounts do more to
mislead than inform, and I could imagine more than
a few readers debating the murderer’s identity even
after finishing this peculiar and unprecedented book. - http://www.postmodernmystery.com/the_face_on_the_cutting_room_floor.html[Ted Gioia]

*****
"After seeing blurbs on Mawrdew Czgowchwz in two magazines and an on-line newsletter, I said "I have to read this book!" Now I have read it and I didn't. The writing is gorgeous, but too much so. Brobdingnagian aggregations of rare multisyllabic verbiage traipse, saunter, stroll, galumph across the page-sometimes arm-in-arm with an idiomatic epigram or eponym-implying to the ophthalmic interlocutor notions of sylvatic artistry, ecstatic glamour and libidinous merriment. Do you know what I mean, toots?
McCourt's theme is the transcendent power of art. The problem I have with the book is McCourt makes you work too hard. His style and vocabulary get in the way of his message. Achieving transcendence in a spiritual sense takes discipline and stamina. But to be whisked away in the concert hall, all you have to do is listen.
Mawrdew Czgowchcz has engaging characters (with fabulous names) a terrific plot, wicked satire and many fun incidents all of which you will enjoy, if you can pry them out McCourt's thickly gilded sentences. Yes, it is very much like Firbank, but Firbank, for his baroque obtuseness, is still swift and immediate on the page.
I wanted to be engulfed and swept away by Mawrdew, instead I just bobbed along the surface, admiring but not fully appreciating. A little less gorgeousness would serve Mawrdew Czgowchcz much better." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RJ03YG39ZW0X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322978[Eric Leventhal]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/A-Smugglers-Bible-Joseph-McElroy/dp/158567351X/[Amazon]

*****
There are many authors who deserve a larger readership (one thinks of William Gaddis, John Hawkes), but none more so than Joseph McElroy. A Smuggler's Bible fell on deaf ears when it was published in 1966, and because of this is often compared to The Recognitions and Under the Volcano. And the comparisons are valid, to a point: For while Gaddis's and Lowry's novels *have* received a deserved amount of, well, recognition (though it's never enough), McElroy's first novel hasn't. This goes for his entire opus of seven novels, all vastly intelligent, structurally and metaphorically brilliant, and, yes, challenging (and equally rewarding). If, as a reader, you feel you should be treated with respect and not have the novelist lead you by the hand and play you for an idiot, then I highly recommend this and McElroy's other novels. There are few voices as unique as his. Few novelists as concerned with what makes us what we are. And fewer are as capable. To summarize A Smuggler's Bible is a difficult task, but, essentially, an easy one (have I contradicted myself?). David Brooke, on the verge of a breakdown, is attempting to assemble, from eight very different manuscripts, his identity, his place in his friends' lives, as seen through their eyes. And in a variety of styles (the influences are strongly Nabokovian & Joycean), with each single manuscript having more material than many respected novels, the story unfolds, and we too begin piecing together what makes David Brooke David Brooke (and possibly what makes us us). McElroy shows a command of characterization, setting, voice, and metaphor that many a lesser novelist has been praised for. I highly recommend this novel, along with McElroy's Lookout Cartridge (currently out of print and perhaps the single most neglected work of the '70's). Joseph McElroy's are works far, far better than this hastily composed "review." Please read him. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EE9A01HRUQJG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158567351X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

"If you're looking for a book to become truly absorbed in, one you'll probably want to re-read as soon as you've finished the last page, this is it. There is such a richness and abundance of thought in these pages, now that I've read it twice I feel like I can dip into it at random and find something worth rediscovering, whether it be earthquakes, improvisational jazz, the physics and engineering of dam construction,the particularly haunting old structures from pre Civil War years that abide today right next to modern buildings of glass-box construction, of course woven elegantly into the main elements that compose a love story: obsession, personal revelations and concealments, humor, mystery, and enchantment. There is a Proustian consciousness of the profound ambiguities of memory, and how its hidden secrets yield a determining influence on our lives, until they rise to the surface and can be overcome, absorbed.... Perhaps I'm wieghing this down with too many generalities, but this novel contains so much, any simple "rendering" or "encapsulation" of the plot would be to do it an injustice. So let something intentionally simplified suffice: a middle-aged man and a young woman fall in love in pre-millennial New York City, both of them are survivors, and in falling in love with each other, both of them come into much closer contact with just what it is that they have survived - its implications and consequences - which brings their budding relationship into serious jeopardy.

It seems that McElroy has been compared throughout his career to authors like Pynchon, DeLillo, Coover, Barthelme, and Barth, but here you find much less of the antic (and sometimes silly) humor of the latter three, something much more accessible and less self-consciously "important" than anything Pynchon has written. DeLillo would be the closest comparison. McElroy has the same gift for capturing the rhythms and nuances of everyday speech, the same sort of global consciousness, the same ability to capture and captivate the reader. But DeLillo, in my opinion, is more likely to be self-indulgent, abuse your attention as a reader (see Cosmopolis, The Body Artist, Ratner's Star, The Names...), where McElroy's serious purpose is always evident, even when he is charming you with humor.

Since reading Actress in the House I've also read the author's ingenious first novel, A Smuggler's Bible, and am now looking forward to the December publication of Lookout Cartridge before undertaking the mammoth Women and Men. Joseph McElroy is a true discovery for me. I hope to share it with many, many people." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37DW1X5XMNVMF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585675792[Yan Fong]

*****
When the Mayor of New York announces his resignation in order to have more time to play with his model trains, his staff is finally forced to acknowledge the epidemic underway has reached an advanced stage.

In McHugh's scientifically, politically, and psychologically convincing account of several weeks when Manhattan and her sister boroughs are besieged by a South American virus that releases the inhibitions of its victims, we encounter a bridging work between Thorne Smith's Prohibition-fueled comedies and the dropout road novels of Kerouac. Neither as silly as the former nor as sober as the latter, Darling builds a strong case for a nascent hippie credo, before finally settling with wistful regret on the side of law and order, presciently rehearsing the actual tumult of the Sixties and Seventies.

Jim Rowan, our narrator and a pivotal mayoral assistant, arrives back in town from Washington and is immediately swept up in the chaos of a city gone arcadian. His wife, Niobe, has succumbed to the virus and become a ringleader among the free-love anarchists. Striving to manage his city and search for his wife simultaneously, Jim nonetheless finds time for several affairs of his own, finally catching the virus himself, but still clinging to his duties.

McHugh's jazzy book scats like an Andrews Sisters ditty, recalling the hepcat stylings of Bester and, at times, the "competent man" philosophizing of Heinlein. McHugh (1904-1983) wrote other novels, including one about an immortal man, but this one is infectious. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2002/cur0207.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

[[Memoirs_of_a_Gnostic_Dwarf]]
*Memoirs of a Gnostic Dwarf* (1997)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1873982712/[Amazon]

*****
This is a hard novel to categorize. It's part historical fiction, part tragic-comedy, part treatise on gnostic thought, and it's part historical lecture on European renaissance-era religion and politics. But somehow it works.

In essence, "Memoirs of a Gnostic Dwarf" is a story of the mysticism of Gnostic thought, orbiting around the interesting and sometimes madcap reign of Pope Leo X, Giovanni de Medici. Peppe (the dwarf) serves as narrator by providing glimpses of his youth, his introduction to Gnosticism, love, and education, which ultimately lands him in a circus, and then the 'court' of Leo X (itself not an actual circus, though one could make that arguement based on Peppe's descriptions).

Peppe is more tragic than comic. He ruminates on his physically painful youth (did I mention he has a rather large hump on his back?) "In the beginning was the pain, and the pain was with me, and the pain was me. It constituted the entirety of my burgeoning consciousness."

And one can't help but make comparisons to George R.R. Martin's own tortured dwarf, Tyrion Lannister. Peppe's mother, in a drunken fit, says, "God knows, I should have suffocated you at birth." Peppe responds in his narrative, "There was a time when I would have wholeheartedly agreed with this; now, however, I am rather glad that she did not suffocate me at birth. Strange, isn't it, how one can always learn to love oneself, however ghastly one is?"

Madsen displays a large and complex vocabulary which dually proves the literate nature of the writer as well as the value of having an e-reader with a built-in dictionary. His writing is big, bold and vividly descriptive.

In one particularly expressive scene, Peppe's only love is tortured for heresy. His description displays well Madsen's vibrant writing abilities: "...what followed fills me with anguish; the memory of it grips my heart like an icy vice. As I write, I know that tears will soon come. A huge and heavy sadness covers me like a shroud, and I cannot shake it off; indeed, I do not want to - for every act of recall, every rearoused memory of what they did to her, merits the expiation of a fresh agony of the soul. A sword pierced and entered the fabric of my psyche that day, and it is there still, for I feel its blade, as sharp and as deadly as ever, move between the infinitesimal spaces where socket meets socket and joint meets joint."

The middle third of the book, author David Madsen focuses much of his time on the political wranglings of and around the papal states. I'm always very appreciative of the historic angle of any historical fiction, however the complications surrounding the Vatican, Spain and France come at the cost of any real propullsion of Peppe's story.

The themes are rather large and heavy, and several plot lines are laced with overt sexual activities. Some may argue that it's gratuitous, but I would respond that it works effectively with the overall tone and themes of the novel.

What is Gnosticism, the reader may ask. One needn't wait long as Peppe provides his definition early in the story. "We hold that there are two equally-matched powers in the universe, one good and the other evil, and these are perpetually at war with one another. The good power created spirit, while the evil power created matter. Matter...corporeal form, the body, flesh, is evil...The devil (or at least a devil) created this world and it is hell." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0P4LJ9SEKA5/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1873982712&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jason Golomb]

*****
"Confessions of a Flesh Eater" serves up a gourmet meal and does not hold back on the condiments, though the cooking remains simple despite reflecting the complexities of Orlando Crispe - chef extraordinaire, gnostic and hedonist.

Single-mindedly devoted to his cause of inducing in the Eater the emotions he wishes to convey, he lets us taste the lives of others with the unique flavours imparted by their experience and demise.

Crispe is delightfully prurient, and there is method to his madness, which justifies his actions on the basis of what he terms 'absorptionism': The consumption of flesh is a final act of love, with the weaker being eaten, ascending to ultimate fulfilment by becoming part of the stronger. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKC86C4G3WH1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=187398247X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Semioticghost]

*****
Connected to Madsen's previous book "Confessions of a Flesh-eater", "Orlando Crispe's Flesh-eater's Cookbook" is a hodgepodge of recipes, culinary activities, memories, and dining experiences. Crispe is a famous chef, whose culinary art has intriguing effects on those who consume it. Using all sorts of meats in his dishes (including human flesh and juices), Crispe documents and reminisces about his friends and acquaintances. It's all rather fascinating, but not having read "Confessions", I was quite lost, like it was all a private joke I was missing out on. Nonetheless, this is an interesting addition to such cannibalistic fiction as Virgilio Piñera's "René's Flesh", Slavenka Drakulic's "The Taste of a Man", and Poppy Brite's "Exquisite Corpse". - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TK3NZLZVIMIT/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JHXDXQ&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

[[The_Postmortal]]
*The Postmortal* (2011)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143119826/[Amazon]

*****
In 2019, the "cure for aging" -- gene therapy -- is legal in only four countries, but immortality can be purchased on the black market. The issue is divisive: gene therapy's opponents use terrorist tactics to attack the black market while protests in favor of legalizing the cure turn ugly. The desire to cheat death ultimately triumphs.

John Farrell takes the cure without devoting much thought to its downside: If you stop aging, retirement isn't an option and you can forget about social security. If your parents don't die, you don't inherit. If you live forever, you never experience eternal respite from annoying relatives and politicians, it's less easy to ignore future threats like global warming, and the escape clause from your marital vows -- until death do us part -- becomes a nullity. Couples often say they marry so they can grow old together. Would they bother with marriage if eternal youth made possible an eternal choice of partners? On a more serious note, the pressures of overpopulation would dramatically increase the already unsustainable consumption of finite resources, a predicament that would initially lead to hoarding, then to war, and ultimately to a barren planet.

Beginning in 2019, Farrell blogs about the impact gene therapy has on his life and the world. The introduction to The Postmortal advises us that Farrell's text files are discovered in 2090. Through Farrell's eyes, we watch the escalating disaster: the rise of pro-death pressure, the burgeoning prison populations resulting from life sentences that last forever, the harsh measures China imposes to assure that its citizens forego the cure, the glorification of suicide, the fracturing of society. Some blog entries reproduce news stories, political punditry, and advertisements (including a FAQ promoting a new religion). Some of Farrell's entries are observational, others are personal.

Postmortal is not immortal; death still occurs from injury and disease, suicide and murder. Death is a frequent subject of Farrell's blog as people close to him are killed. After a few decades, Farrell becomes an end specialist (sort of a futuristic Kevorkian, except that the government not only approves of assisted suicide but rewards it with a tax rebate). It is difficult to fault Farrell's role in the postmortal future. Compared, at least, to the roving street gangs, organ thieves, and religious charlatans, Farrell's job seems both necessary and altruistic.

Although Drew Magary describes a terrifying future, he keeps the tone light -- perhaps too light. The Postmortal works surprisingly well as a dystopian comedy (if there is such a thing), but the incongruity of laughter and disaster robs the story of its potential power. In the novel's third act, after an event called "the correction" occurs, the story appears to take a more serious course. The disconnect between humor and horror at that point becomes jarring; it is not a line Magary straddles comfortably. Viewed as a cautionary tale about the consequences of overpopulation, the comedy seems misplaced; viewed as a farcical take on the desire for immortality, the drama overshadows the farce.

Those reservations aside, I have no qualms about recommending The Postmortal to readers who aren't put off by dark comedy. While I got a kick out of Magary's humor (his dialog is both realistic and insanely funny), I also enjoyed pondering the issues he raises. Magary obviously gave considerable imaginative thought to the consequences of a genetic cure for aging (including its impact on home run records). There were times when I thought the story went off course, but there was never a moment when my interest in the novel waned. In the end, Magary tells us, there is only the inevitable end. If you can accept that -- even more, if you can laugh about it -- I suspect you'll like The Postmortal. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAV6TL3MAYFV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143119826&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[TChris]

*****
 This short book contains two pieces of writing by Xavier de Maistre, both based on the same premise - a journey around a room. In fact, this premise is an excuse for a semi-serious, semi-comic series of flights of fancy. The author was a late 18th century French aristocrat with a romantic attitude and I was concerned that I might find these writings dated and inconsequential, which to some extent they are, but I enjoyed reading them. I was aware that these writings were relatively short so there was always an end in sight. However, when the ends came I was a little disappointed that there was not more to read.

There is one journey, "A Journey around My Room", and one expedition, "A Nocturnal Expedition around My Room". Both rooms are in Turin, where de Maistre was serving in the army, but the rooms are in different buildings, at different times. The first building was destroyed when the Fench revolutionary war reached Turin. The Journey lasted 42 days, when de Maistre was confined to his apartment after fighting a duel, so it is really a prison diary. The Expedition lasts for only 4 hours, from 8pm to midnight, and consists mainly of the author sitting astride his window in the top floor, looking out at the sky, the roof, his neighbours and the city and describing his thoughts.

Towards the end of the book he describes his method: "There was an old woman, a relative of mine, very witty - her conversation was always very interesting. But her memory, both inconstant and fertile, often led her to leap from one episode to the next, and from one digression to another, to such an extent that she was obliged to ask her listeners for their help: "So what was it I was telling you about?" she would ask, and often her listeners too had forgotten, which plunged the whole assembly into indescribable perplexity. Now, it may have been noticed that the same thing often happens to me in my narrations, and I have to admit that, yes, the plan and order of my journey mimic exactly the plan and order of my aunt's conversations"

"A Journey around My Room" is 69 pages and "A Nocturnal Expedition around My Room" 62 pages. There is a 4 page Foreword by  Alain de Botton  and a 7 page Introduction by the translator, Andrew Brown. Alain de Botton concentrates on the journey aspect, noting that in familiar places "We have become habituated and therefore blind". Andrew Brown emphasises the literary comparisons. He mentions  Beckett , Bunyan , Proust , Spoerri  and  Perec . Asterisks(*) in the text indicate a reference in the 7 page Notes at the end of the book. I found these very useful. - https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Around-Room-Alma-Classics/dp/1847493084/[Mac McAleer]

*****
Curzio Malaparte was like me, an infantry officer and a journalist. He served in the ranks of the French Army in World War 1 and then as a war correspondent on the eastern front with the Germans, on the northern front with the Finns, and in Poland with the occupation authorities during world war 11. A man who acquired both culture and status by sheer force of personality he was the director of press at the fatal 'Peace' conference of Versailles in 1919, which half ended World War 1 and set the scene for World War 11. The book, as Walter Murch wrote in Zoetrope magazine in 1998 is a searing revelation not only of war and its manifest evil, but of something much more serious, that of the evil that apparently civilised men and women can do, when all restraints are lifted. There comes a time when the facts soar out of our reach, either of the imagination or of the mind, when they are too terrible to contemplate. I find this with the Holocaust. My mind simply refuses to grapple with the enormity of it, taken together with the enormity of the Russian losses, which always make me weep as I enter Moscow past the anti tank traps that are still there. In Kaputt I can feel Malaparte cringing from the horror, but at the same time determined to find some way to decscribe it. And I feel he succeeds. He does enable a person to confront the fact that it was a bunch of classical music lovers, led by Frank, the Nazi Governor of Poland, who created the Ghetto in order to "liberate the Jews". More than almost any other writer on World War 11, he gets under the skin of the Germans, and into the Nazi mind and perhaps even more so, into the mind of the anti semites of Roumania, Poland anD Russia, who made their own awful contribution to the Holocaust. Younger readers should not let the slightly dated style put them off. Here is the inner reality of war as it has seldom been described. Here is the Nazi mind as seldom seen. Here is the terrible truth of World War 11, made accessible (just) to those who did not directly experience it. And learn from the two most poignant scenes in the book; the one in which he fails to do anything about the Jews of Jassy, and the one in which he tries to get under the skin of Frank, a man in whom banality and evil fought for control and in which evil emerged triumphant and out of which 6 million Jews died. Few can have come so close to the ultimate malignancy and lived. But seldom has the effect of guilty and the burden of hoplessness been so well portrayed. A book for all time. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0QZ2FMABD3P/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171470&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[kevin cahill]

*****
"As is stated in the Hofstadter's Afterword, in my edition, Malaparte's writing is "....haunted by the desire to have been Proust." For anyone who has read Proust, this is clear from the title of the first chapter of the work, "Du Cote de Guuermantes". But of course, Malaparte is no Proust. No writer in all of literature is. Further, the setting of the opus is not the dinner tables of the aristocracy or of the haute bourgeoisie, but battlefronts in Eastern Europe and the dinner tables of ruthless men at war-Nevertheless, Malaparte does manage to capture some of the Proustian effect in his camera-eye, vivid, detailed snapshots of this environment.

But-caveat lector-this environment is so loathsome, bestial and vile-as wars tend to be-that one is in danger in becoming, by absorbing one's self in this book, in losing any hope in or affection for humanity. From horseheads rising from the surface from the frozen over Lake Laguda (perhaps the most lasting image, because so beautiful and horrific at once), to the officer who keeps a jar of human eyeballs of the partisans he is fighting on his desk to, well, any number of ghastly scenes, it is impossible for the reader to come away from Malaparte's take on the war, unaffected (excepting, of course, "readers" who dismiss the book out of hand and leave it deliberately on the airplane as one reviewer admits to doing).-But, perhaps, this reviewer's reaction is understandable. None of us relish looking on the dark, bestial side of men and women who might well be ourselves, given different circumstances of time and place.

But what significantly marks this book apart from all other war writings is the unwillingness to overtly take sides. It sometimes seems that one is reading an account of an extraterrestrial who has visited Europe to give an account of human behaviour. You won't find any Neo-Nazi glorification here, but neither will you find any of the late Stephen Ambrose's "Greatest Generation" American triumphalism. This is what truly makes the work great and a must have for every literate human unafraid of the tableaux that war presents: This, seemingly at least, disinterested depiction of the behaviour of men at their worst-The only writer Malaparte resembles, really, is not Proust, but the German writer Ernst Junger, whose journals, alas, have not yet been translated into English.

Well, prospective reader, there's the gauntlet-pick it up, if you dare." - https://www.amazon.com/review/RSMW7C2ZQ7CPA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm[Daniel Myers]

*The Skin* (2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Skin-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590176227/[Amazon]

*****
"The Skin" is a complex and fascinating book.

Ostensibly it is about the American army arriving in Italy during WWII and coming into contact (often for the first time) with Europe's spiritual and moral corruption and degradation. The idea was copied a (little) bit by Joseph Heller in Catch-22. If you've read Catch-22, you have SOME an idea about what to expect.

But "The Skin" is a deeper book than Catch-22, and Malaparte was much more interested in the differences between the decadence of the old world and the brash, conquering innocence of the New World, where things such as defeat are considered physically and morally impossible. Defeat is actually seen as morally reprehensible and somehow or other, the fault of the defeated.

Unlike Heller, Malaparte never portrays the military or the politicians as out and out bufoons: he realizes that people are invariably more complex than that.

It is a rare combination of intellectual writing, combined with moments of vibrantly dark humour. An example: when an American liason officer speaks about Italian women selling their bodies, Malaparte replies that all that they are actually selling is their hunger. And that it'd be a marvellous thing if every American soldier could take home a piece of hunger to show his wife what amazing things you can buy for money.

The title, by the way, refers to Malaparte's comment that once flags have been proven worthless and shamed, the only flag people are willing to fight for is that of their own skin. The indomitable spirit of mankind is shown to be a greedy, grasping thing that will stop at nothing in order to continue existing. And the spectacle is anything but edifying. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BIB2FPSB8JUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590176227&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Vince Cabrera]

*****
HEROVIT'S WORLD is the third book by Barry Malzberg that I've read (OVERLAY and BEYOND APOLLO the other two), and so far, I'd have to put HEROVIT'S WORLD at the top. Barry Malzberg is, I think, always only going to appeal to a small subset of readers, and many of those who WOULD appreciate him have probably never heard of him because of his close association with genre fiction. Which is a shame--HEROVIT'S WORLD, for instance, really has no `science fiction' about it at all; instead, it's about a science-fiction writer who is essentially having a nervous breakdown. Yet it still should have special appeal to lovers of science-fiction, as it satirizes the field, the writers, and the subjects, while at the same time giving us a glimpse (probably quite accurate) of the lifestyle of a pulp fiction writer.

Jonathan Herovit, successful author of ninety-two novels, has been going downhill for a long time--everybody knows it; his fans, his editor, his wife, himself. Even his alter ego, the pseudonym Kirk Poland knows it--Kirk Poland, who Herovit imagines to be everything Herovit is not, and who offers, finally, to step in and replace Herovit, and to get everything back on track again. Herovit can only avoid the lure of this kind of escape for so long, and soon enough, Poland is calling the shots--but is Herovit's life as easy to direct in reality as it seemed from the sidelines?

In many ways, HEROVIT'S WORLD reads as if Mr. Malzberg never really had a clue where he was going with it--just kept inserting paper into the typewriter, and whatever came to him next was what went into the novel. For me, this actually added to the charm of it--several times I thought I knew where it was going, and it took off in a completely different way. Conversely, there is a somewhat disjointed feel to it, as well as material that reads like filler. All of which conforms to the way Herovit is described as writing--I don't know if Mr. Malzberg's descriptions of Herovit gave me the idea, or the material itself, but knowing that Mr. Malzberg wrote dozens of novels himself, I have to believe at least some part of his description of the writing process was taken from his own experience.

This passage, in particular, seems to sum up the idea of churning out book after book, and might be an insight gleaned only from real life:

"But he tries never to revise. It was an old policy settled from the beginning. Once you started revising, there was just no end to any of it: first it was a line here or there, then a paragraph or a shred of dialogue that didn't quite work; soon you were up to whole scenes that didn't work...if you got deep into the revision question, you might never be able to write new stuff again. Hunks of novels and short stories, like dismembered limbs, would be fed through the typewriter over and again and nothing would ever be right. That was the problem once you started looking at this stuff critically: it NEVER could be right; it was already rotten to the bottom."

Whether or not HEROVIT'S WORLD is another `rotten to the bottom' piece of pulp-fiction hack work, or something that rises above is surely a matter of taste. For myself, it seems to fit well into the Stanley Elkin, Bernard Malamud style of humor, with the added benefit of dealing with a genre that I've dearly loved in the past. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8VVW8LPLIW8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WE11TI&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bryan Byrd]

*****
I think one of the reviews posted on the book says much the same thing about it, but chances are you the people out there have never seen this book, let alone heard of it. Shame on someone. I was vaguely familar with Malzberg, having heard of his great works Beyond Apollo, Herovit's World and Chorale, but seeing this slim volume in a comic book store (three bucks!) grabbed my attention. The plot summary on the back of the book does no justice to the actual content of the book and indeed makes one wonder if the person who did that actually read the book, unless Malzberg himself wrote it as a complicated joke. The "plot" then. Basically, just as the author writes in the beginning, it's the series of notes for a novel called "Galaxies" where a woman space technician accidentally pilots her ship into a black galaxy (a black hole, essentially). The author uses the idea of sketches for a novel and this as a jump off point for some of the funniest explorations of the nature of writing and science fiction ever, both as a genre and as a publishing market. I've rarely laughed out loud so many times, Malzberg dips from seriousness to hilarity while keeping that same dry cynical tone (even funnier if you've seen a picture of him, he has the most dour, long face I've ever seen), all the while seeming to wink just at the edges that it's all in good fun. He debates the content of the novel, how much sex to put in, where science comes into play, the nature of science in science fiction, the entire bit and manages not only to hit his mark each and every time but manages to make all this stuff just as relevant today, probably the hardest part. Back then people probably thought this book was "weird" after all it is written as notes for a novel but that's the entire point there was no other way for the point to be gotten across (and as the author says the novel could never be written properly, since it takes place in the 40th century). A slim work that won't take up much of your time, you'll probably spend more time thinking about what you've read and pondering it than actually reading the book. Alas, maybe it's good that it's not in print today, genius publishers would probably turn it into an expensive trade paperback, inflate the price and no one would want to spend that kind of money on such a small book. Easier to snag it in some garage sale or used book store (not that he doesn't deserve the money) and pass it along to friends. One of the more essential science fiction books, especially if you want to understand what this genre just might be all about. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9XD7R34MMBR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989239144&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Michael Battaglia]

*****
"Let's face it, I bought this book for its cover and its slim size. I have seldom been disappointed by NYRB books, and thought this would make a tart little sorbet between more substantial courses. Besides, I was curious about this "genre-redefining French crime novelist" who died in 1995 at the age of 53, and the inclusion of an afterword by no less than Jean Echenoz, who has done a bit of genre redefining himself, promised at least a pedigree.

It is a short work, only 91 pages, and of little substance, but I was not disappointed. It begins with a bang, when a rich hunter in Eastern France is shot at close range by a beautiful woman, who then changes her appearance and boards a luxury night sleeper to the other end of the country, headed for the fictional port city of Bléville. Now calling herself Aimée Joubert, she insinuates herself among the movers and shakers in the place, uncovers the rivalries and shady dealings, and ends with an astonishing high body count for such a short book.

Manchette was apparently a practitioner of the "néo-polar": that is to say, a crime thriller with a politically radical agenda. And Aimée is decidedly an anti-establishment killer. The name of the city, which translates roughly to Bread Town, indicates that it will be a gathering place for the rich people who are her usual prey. But it carries an almost playful air of satire, utterly different from the social realism of French "policiers" in the manner of, say, Simenon. Killer though she is, we come to like Aimée, and though the town's oligarchy are mired in corruption and we certainly do not admire many of them, they seem more like caricatures than class oppressors. Indeed, when the first death occurred in this new setting, I almost took it as a piece of surreal absurdity.

Perhaps I was influenced by the endorsement from Jean Echenoz, whose JE M'EN VAIS has also its fair share of black absurdity. Also like Echenoz, Manchette revels in precise details of dress, measurements, and accessories, whether describing Aimée descending from the train ("boots in fawn leather with very high heels, a brown tweed skirt, a beige silk blouse, and a fawn suede car coat"), or her orgiastic celebration of her ill-gotten gains on the train the night before: "And here in this luxury compartment of this luxury train her nostrils were assailed at once by the luxurious scent of the champagne and the foul odor of the filthy banknotes and the foul odor of the choucroute, which smelt like piss and sperm." [The racy translation is by Donald Nicholson-Smith.] Not your everyday crime novel, by any means, but often surprising, and consistently entertaining." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QT2CPM2LJI3X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590173813[Roger Brunyate]

*****
Jean-Patrick Manchette whose early demise certainly robbed us of a brilliant French satirist and social commentator could teach the current crop of American writers a thing or two about subtlety as well as sophistication. I am not writing about the typical American predisposition towards French culture that is seen through the prism of Lost Generation Paris or French food or pop culture observations of French culture which assumes that all you must do is put a "Le or La" in front of something and you understand it.
Manchette, especially in this book manages to satirically savage everything in his sights without seeming to be on a soapbox.

This is the story of a contract killing gone terribly wrong. Without becoming too explicit about, the target is a wealthy man's nephew who is overseen by a woman who has recently been released from a mental institution. Manchette is not coy about motives but he is incredibly adept at weaving the tale in order to comment upon society. It is action that speaks and conveys his opinions about the wealthy, the bourgeois, materialism, architecture, etc. This book must be read to be understood. The violence depicted is so fast paced and over the top that you will not be shocked but propelled to read at an even faster rate. Each character no matter how peripheral is intricate to propelling the plot and action. The chase says it all and if you have ever gone to a large retain store, you will be impressed about the psychology of the people. Gallic understatement surrounds the conversations, as when the supposedly hit man extraordinaire is followed by blindly by his gang of misfits because as they say "he is a professional."

So experience this unique talent and watch out for the lethal laughs. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GLC5RJ5U1J2I/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590177207&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

"The Mad and the Bad is the latest Manchette novel to appear in English, which has been skillfully translated by Donald Nicholson-Smith. Originally published in 1972, the novel shares the same nightmarish and unclassifiable qualities of what Kingsley Amis said of G. K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday: "not quite a political bad dream, nor a metaphysical thriller, nor a cosmic joke in the form of a spy novel, but it has something of all three." Yet unlike Chesterton's novel, The Mad and the Bad is an entirely profane nightmare, which only flirts with moral or ideological messages, throwing them out in offhand ways, so as not to distract too much from the thrill of the ride. And what a ride! The novel begins with a strange, unassuming premise: Julie is somewhat randomly plucked from an asylum by the immensely wealthy philanthropist and businessman Michel Hartog, to care for his bratty, orphaned nephew Peter. It doesn't matter that Julie is psychologically unbalanced or that she's unqualified as a nursemaid, Hartog seems as well-meaning as he is eccentric and filthy rich: according to his chauffeur who has a debilitating limp from the war, "The boss's way of doing good is over the top. He only hires retards . . . The cook is epileptic. The gardener only has one arm, pretty handy for using the shears. His private secretary is blind. His valet suffers from locomotor ataxia - no wonder his meals arrive cold!" Julie is an odd fixture at this modern mansion lined with Mondrians and Pollocks - but her time here is short-lived: the day after beginning her new job as a nursemaid, both Julie and Peter are kidnapped and flung into an elaborate plot, which begins to spiral out of control as the unlikely pair are pursued across France by a sickly hired assassin named Thompson and a couple of his cronies. Thompson, the veteran killer, perfectly contrasts Julie's inexperience with the criminal world: he's an exemplary hard-boiled character, who embodies many of the genre's ideals - an unsentimental thug who spouts wooden lines like, "Don't move or I'll hurt you" and "They'll have to be killed, all three of them" - but he's tired and washed up, as though these ideals have decayed inside of him, hollowing him into a saggy balloon-like caricature of the typical hard-boiled hero. Killers become a bit ridiculous in old age - murder is a young-man's game, increasingly so as the reality of a bullet is replaced by ulcers or emphysema (and perhaps unintentionally, this also echoes Manchette's broader ideas about the crime genre, which, by the seventies, already had more than a few wrinkles). Thompson, though he lacks any fully articulated psychological depth, is still one of the most intriguing elements of the novel, at least to me, following the reasoning that Don Quixote's relationship with chivalric romances wouldn't be as strange or interesting if he had begun his journey as an able-bodied young man. The reader inevitable senses, after spending only a few pages with Thompson, that this job will be his last.

Despite the kidnapping, shootouts, thefts, killings, and many other criminal offenses that Thompson and his men - as well as Julie - get involved with, the police have almost no involvement in the novel. The police are capitalism's servants and therefore the enemy, even to Julie, who is being pursued by assassins: Manchette, in one brief essay, tried to encapsulate his political response to the crime novel: "Social and political power is exercised by bastards. More precisely, by unscrupulous capitalists, allies of or identical to gangsters brought together in organizations, having in their pay politicians, journalists, and other ideologues, as well as justice, the police, and other henchmen." In this light, the fringes of society are reduced fighting with an aggressively individualistic morality - bitter existentialism with a taste for blood, and here, the law only clutters things up. The best that the criminals or Julie - who escaped from a different imposed order, the mental institution - can hope for is to escape, or having failed that, to fight the law and lose with unwavering convictions. One of the most unforgettable scenes of the novel is an example of this utter neglect for order or the law, in which a department store is set on fire by Julie, and it's amid this pandemonium that Thompson finally finds himself truly in his element: "Fragments of plastic flew from the display. The store was filled by an intense tumult. This is exciting, I am enjoying this, Thompson told himself as he spat gastric juice onto the ground." If Zola was the novelist of the department store, Manchette is the novelist of the destruction of the department store." - http://www.musicandliterature.org/reviews/2014/8/3/jean-patrick-manchettes-the-mad-and-the-bad[Tynan Kogane]

It just keeps zooming down at you, a perpetual cycle of hate, hate, frank, horrific dreams packaged with the knowledge that you can attain them, the state of being such a FRANK, a being self-condemned to hovering within and controlling all that is disreputable and eternal, violent and intellectual, such a Frank that enacts each twinge of his brain with such clarity and skillful desire to bring about horror and sickness that each seemingly unlikely turn of events gradually and subversively brings the world from happy day-glo mental static/stasis into the plaything of frank's own desire.. Put it on the same bookshelf as "Time's Arrow," by Martin Amis, and "Chants de Maldoror," by Isidore Ducasse. George Mangels is my hero!

[[Secret_Tibet]]
*Secret Tibet* (1950)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Tibet-Fosco-Maraini/dp/8173030154/[Amazon]

*****
I have read a lot of books about the old days in Tibet, and this is the best, despite the fact that Maraini never went to Lhasa, the holy grail of most adventurers in those days. But Mariani made no attempt to accompany his employer, the famous Tibetologist Giuseppi Tucci. Tucci claimed to be a Buddhist in order to be allowed to visit Lhasa, and Maraini wasn't a Buddhist (and suggests that Tucci wasn't either) and so chose not to try to trick or bully his way in to the capital. That alone makes him more admirable, in my book, than most of the arrogant Europeans who took it for granted that it was their God-given right to poke their noses into other people's cultures any way they could.

Maraini actually travelled in Tibet on two different occasions, 1939 and 1948, and telescopes both visits in this book, although most of it is based in the 1948 trip. As an Italian, and a highly cultured European, he has a somewhat more sympathetic view of Tibet than English and American writers. He compares Tibet not to Nebraska but to Florence, the Italian Alps, Italian Catholicism, and the Vatican. While Tibet was medieval, in many ways Catholicism in the 30s and 40s could also be called medieval. Maraini thinks like a man of science, but he knows the mind of Italian peasants as well, and an old woman repeating a mantra is not so different from an old woman in Italy saying her own rosary. So there is a lot of sympathy in his view.

He is also clear-sighted. He does not like dirt and smells, for example, and when he describes the Tibetans, he doesn't pretend not to notice the level of filth. He admires Buddhism, but not so much that he loses objectivity. Underground chapels which contain animal carcasses stuffed with straw and rotting away and artwork filled with skulls, human bones and bloody images horrify him, and he says so.

He also conveys a wonderful sense of the beauty, the air, the silence, the scale and scope of the Tibetan land. His book is about people and events, which he describes with piercing insight and analysis. He describes faces and bodies in terms of the character they reveal. He doesn't fill pages with descriptions of ornery porters and bad trails. Instead he takes the hardships of travel for granted and describes the personality and character of every person, mountain, monastery, dance, and meal. The fact that he was not hell-bent for Lhasa allows him to be present in each place that he visits.

Because he is along on the trip as a photographer, he observes the art intensely. His writing is vivid, poetic but not pretentious, and the translation from the Italian is flawless, at least as English style goes. You would never imagine that you are reading a translation.

Maraini also had another advantage that makes him the perfect travel companion--he lived and taught in Japan in the years between his first and second trips to Tibet (because WW2 had broken out and he got stranded there) so he can see Tibet not only as it appears to a European but also in the greater context of Asia.

The updates that contrast the Tibet he saw and the Tibet of 1998 are saddening but give even richer context to the story. He intersperses these at the end of each chapter, so you don't have to try remember which monastery or city he is talking about. The book is skillfully edited so that the three time periods involved flow smoothly into one fascinating narrative.

I am eager to read Maraini's other works, because he is a man of great insight, an open heart and a clear mind. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GK3KJ4XAQNI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8173030154&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Evelyn Uyemura]

[[Plant_Thinking]]
*Plant-Thinking: A Philosophy of Vegetal Life* (2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Plant-Thinking-A-Philosophy-Vegetal-Life/dp/0231161255/[Amazon]

*****
This is a brilliant piece of academic satire. By employing various popular facets of au courant post-structuralist philosophy (Levinas, Derrida, Deleuze & Guattari, ecocriticism, etc.), Marder has put together a perfectly professional assemblage in favor of extending human and animal rights to plants.

Marder has gotten a lot of flak for his views, but whenever he debates others in his field, he wins. Why? Because they have no defense but to fall back into essentialist and hierarchical positions that their tradition has rejected as anathema. One critic said that plants aren't "sentient" and lack "intentionality," but these are not tenable arguments in the post-structuralist argot. So Marder calls his opponents reactionary and hegemonic, and by their own standards, they are. Marder writes:

"First, it seems that the "food chain," at the top of which we, humans, presumably are, is the contemporary reflection of the metaphysical Great Chain of Being. In my view it is not enough to meddle with only one aspect of this structure (the relation between humans and animals), while leaving the rest intact. I would think that we need to question such hierarchical formations in all respects, and I am yet to hear my vegan friends endorse this position."

"The other who (or that) bestows upon us our humanity need not be--in keeping with Aristotle's preferred points of comparison in The Politics--a god or a beast, the magnificently superhuman or the deplorably subhuman. It may well be the most mundane and unobtrusive instance of alterity, to which we do not dare to compare ourselves: the plant."

"Apropos of the multifaceted sexual differences of Dasein, Derrida writes in the Geschlecht series: ``If Dasein as such belongs to neither of the two sexes, this doesn't mean that its being is deprived of sex. On the contrary, here one must think of a predifferentiated, rather a pre-dual, sexuality--which doesn't necessarily mean unitary, homogeneous, or undifferentiated...[but] more originary than a dyad.'' Multiple vegetal sexualities will reinforce the dispersed multiplicity of vegetal being that does not adopt an oppositional stance toward its surroundings. The pre-dual sexual-ontological constitution of animals and humans is a legacy of vegetal dissemination. Just as the ``neutrality'' of Dasein saturates it with sexuality to the brink, overﬂowing the dyadic relation, so the indifference of vegetal sex life surpasses the logic of oppositionality and produces differences without regard to the exigencies of sameness."

There is nothing in here to raise an eyebrow--Marder's arguments are as sound as any in his field, and better written than most. How can a Derridean or a speculative materialist object to Marder but with an incredulous stare? But Marder has David Lewis's knock-down response available to him: "I cannot refute an incredulous stare."

Many would prefer just to ridicule or ignore Marder. But until they can provide reason to do so without looking like hypocrites, Marder has triumphed. Alan Sokal made the mistake of announcing his hoax, causing his paper to be identified as a virulent entity and shut out from further damage. Marder is not so foolish, though his association with neo-conservative Russell "Freedom or Terror" Berman may well raise suspicions and left me with a sour aftertaste after the irreverent fun. Perhaps, however, that only makes Plant-Thinking more appropriate to our time. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZ0E5KC8U3IK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231161255&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[David Aeurbach]

This review has left me amazed, crippled and unable to formulate a coherent reaction. In fact it has left me in an almost vegetative state.

I'm in the midst of reading Marder's book, and so far I rate it highly as it is giving me useful new perspectives and ideas. Then I stumble on this review, which asserts that Plant-Thinking is satire! Either Marder is being disingenuous, or Auerbach is steeped so thoroughly in the anglo-saxon ways that he has lost sight of what is meant by thinking, and the only option allowed by his logic is to identify the book as satire, I thought.

The third option is that Auerbach is being disingenuous, but in a constructive way. After having given the matter some more thought, I realised that this review itself is brilliantly satirical. It is a perfectly professional assemblage painting an honestly felt work as satire. Effectively, it preempts and renders impossible most of the superficial reactions that one might expect from the analytical camp. What are these would-be critics of Marder to say? There is no space left for them to occupy. Commentators keen to slap the "postmodern gibberish" label on Marder must now see themselves in the mirror that this review holds up, and as they do so, the futility of their position becomes apparent even to them themselves. The Sokal maneuver has been turned back on the Sokals.

Something like a fractal structure can be made out. I am in awe of the meta-academic maneuver that has been pulled off here and I applaud it. I do hope that it will not make people who take things too literally avoid Marder's work. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZ0E5KC8U3IK/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231161255&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[J.

*****
A modernist urban novel in the tradition of James Joyce, Adam Buenosayres is a tour-de-force that does for Buenos Aires what Carlos Fuentes did for Mexico City or José Lezama Lima did for Havana - chronicles a city teeming with life in all its clever and crass, rude and intelligent forms. Employing a range of literary styles and a variety of voices, Leopoldo Marechal parodies and celebrates Argentina's most brilliant literary and artistic generation, the martinfierristas of the 1920s, among them Jorge Luis Borges. First published in 1948 during the polarizing reign of Juan Perón, the novel was hailed by Julio Cortázar as an extraordinary event in twentieth-century Argentine literature. Set over the course of three break-neck days, Adam Buenosayres follows the protagonist through an apparent metaphysical awakening, a battle for his soul fought by angels and demons, and a descent through a place resembling a comic version of Dante's hell. Presenting both a breathtaking translation and thorough explanatory notes, Norman Cheadle captures the limitless language of Marechal's original and guides the reader along an unmatched journey through the culture of Buenos Aires. This first-ever English translation brings to light Marechal's masterwork with an introduction outlining the novel's importance in various contexts - Argentine, Latin American, and world literature - and with notes illuminating its literary, cultural, and historical references. A salient feature of the Argentine canon, Adam Buenosayres is both a path-breaking novel and a key text for understanding Argentina's cultural and political history. - http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Buenosayres-Novel-Leopoldo-Marechal/dp/0773543090/[Amazon boilerplate]

http://www.amazon.com/Ballad-Dingus-Magee-David-Markson/dp/1582434107/[Amazon]

*****
David Markson was recently (2007) named as one of the 60 best authors you've never read by New York magazine. Up until yesterday I counted myself as one of the unread, but no more. I did not read one of his postmodern works like The Last Novel or Vanishing Point: A Novel, but rather one of his earliest works, the anti-Western The Ballad of Dingus Magee.

The back matter on the recently reissued paperback asserts Markson wrote Dingus Magee in a `much more traditional narrative style' than his postmodern works. That claim makes me wonder if the publisher actually read the book!

Whatever. The Ballad of Dingus Magee is a hoot from beginning to end as it relates the feud between the desperado Dingus Billy Magee and Sheriff C.L. Hoke Birdsill. The book starts in the middle and then runs in hilarious circles to and fro, but basically Magee seeks feminine companionship (and fortune) whilst Hoke Birdrippings seeks fame (and fortune). Sheriff Birdbottom repeatedly captures Dingus only to fall victim to some folly before Hoke can collect the reward money. Dingus and Hoke conspire to inflate Dingus's desperado repute so that the reward grows even when Dingus is down in Old Mex.

The hapless Turkey Doolan finds himself in the middle of the feud on more than one occasion and wants nothing more than to bask in the shade of Dingus Magee's glory. Markson holds the whole Old West in some disregard. Witness his description of the (allegedly!) phony heroics of the Earps, Hickok, and Pat Garret to name a few (pages 109-110) , and of George Armstrong Custer as: "nothing but a mule-sniffing, boastful, yeller-haired fool that dint have the sense to wait on the rest of his troops and got massacred for it..."

What Markson's Old West lacks in heroism it makes up in overflowing randiness. As the independently operating entrepreneur Anna Hot Water might have said, there's a bim-bam here and a bim-bam there, everywhere a bim-bam. Even the equine Miss Agnes Pfeiffer manages to engage in intimate contact with Dingus, Hoke, and Turkey after convincing each of them that her chills can only be cured by brotherly cuddling.

Nacherly, Dingus runs afoul of the town's business woman, `Big Blouse' Belle Nops who enraged describes him as, "The lamb-ramming, rump-rooting, scut-befouling, fist-wiving, gopher-mounting, finger-thrusting, maidenhead-barging, bird's-nest-ransacking, shift-besh*tting, two-at-a-time-tupping lecherous little pox."

Markson riotously debunks the heroic image of the Old West in ways reminiscent of Thomas Berger's Little Big Man (Panther) and has great fun with the dialect along the way. Highest recommendation for anyone with an interest in the Old West mythology or in need of a few laughs. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSQO9W856SLU/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582434107&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Douglas S.

An erotic... no, that sounds too simply pornographic...

A bawdy... no, this isn't "Tom Jones" for god's sake...

A tale of sexual (well, that's too clinical, but get on with the review, dammit) pursuit, success, failure, futility, jealousy, and ultimately triumph. A patently hilarious novel whose jokes run the gamut from Joyce to baseball. That's perhaps a smaller gamut that it appears at first look, but it hits my intellectual sweet spot for sure.

Comic novels are strange beasts, and this is no different. The syntax is bizarre, the protagonist hard to warm up to, the object of his affection alternatingly fetching, unsanitary, witty and aloof. But I fell in love with the whole unholy mess. If I remember right, there's a five page stretch that has laugh out loud jokes about anal sex, Aquinas remembered from *Ulysses*, and Mel Ott. (I may be wrong about Mel Ott. But it was some baseball player. I've lent the book out or I'd check it now).

*The Bohemians* (18th century)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812241940/[Amazon]

*****
This is a previously unknown example of the premodern French experimental novel, a genre that began with Rabelais and includes Barthelemy Aneau’s “Alector,” Charles Sorel’s anti-novels (a term he coined), Paul Scarron’s “Comic Novel” (alluded to near the end of chap. 9 of “The Bohemians”), Antoine Furetiere’s “Bourgeois Romance,” Adrien-Thomas de Subligny’s “The Mock Clelia,” Laurent Bordelon’s “Monsieur Oufle,” several of Marivaux’s early novels, Claude-Prosper de Crebillon’s “The Skimmer,” Denis Diderot’s “Jacques the Fatalist,” and Xavier de Maistre’s “Voyage around My Room.”

However, Pelleport’s main influences, as Robert Darnton points out in his very full and informative introduction, were “Don Quixote” and “Tristram Shandy.” Like Cervantes’ novel, “The Bohemians” is a road novel with many digressions, and like Sterne’s novel it is deliberately eccentric and metafictional. Though rather slapdash and not entirely successful, “The Bohemians” offers a raw look at life in 18th-century France--he shows that it was a boil that needed to be lanced by the Revolution--and how awful the life of an minor author was (is). It is more sexually explicit than most French novels of the period, bordering on pornography at times, though more farcical than obscene.

Darnton is to be congratulated for rescuing this outlandish novel from oblivion, and Vivian Folkenflik for her smooth, faithful translation. A model scholarly edition, the 148-page novel is preceded by 40 pages of front matter and followed by 44 pages of copious annotations (though the Scarron allusion is unnoted). Five stars for the edition, three stars for the novel itself. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R14RWNM48D53K6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812241940&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Steven Moore]

While the marquis de Sade was drafting The 120 Days of Sodom in the Bastille, another libertine marquis in a nearby cell was also writing a novel—one equally outrageous, full of sex and slander, and more revealing for what it had to say about the conditions of writers and writing itself. Yet Sade's neighbor, the marquis de Pelleport, is almost completely unknown today, and his novel, Les Bohémiens, has nearly vanished. Only a half dozen copies are available in libraries throughout the world. This edition, the first in English, opens a window into the world of garret poets, literary adventurers, down-and-out philosophers, and Grub Street hacks writing in the waning days of the Ancien Régime.

The Bohemians tells the tale of a troupe of vagabond writer-philosophers and their sexual partners, wandering through the countryside of Champagne accompanied by a donkey loaded with their many unpublished manuscripts. They live off the land—for the most part by stealing chickens from peasants. They deliver endless philosophic harangues, one more absurd than the other, bawl and brawl like schoolchildren, copulate with each other, and pause only to gobble up whatever they can poach from the barnyards along their route.

Full of lively prose, parody, dialogue, double entendre, humor, outrageous incidents, social commentary, and obscenity, The Bohemians is a tour de force. As Robert Darnton writes in his introduction to the book, it spans several genres and can be read simultaneously as a picaresque novel, a roman à clef, a collection of essays, a libertine tract, and an autobiography. Rediscovered by Darnton and brought gloriously back to life in Vivian Folkenflik's translation, The Bohemians at last takes its place as a major work of eighteenth-century libertinism. - http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812241940/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
I read a sampling of Polish literature as an undergrad, a sampling that was kind of a like a shrink-wrapped Christmas gift basket: A centerpiece fruit of Czeslaw Milosz, a cheese cube of Wislawa Szymborska, a hard candy of Zbigniew Herbert. The professor (himself American) made no bones about the notion that he thought of we Americans as Romans at dinner importing exotic delicacies for consumption and political conversation. Being the carless (as in, non-car owning) wage-slave struggling through school that I was, I didn't relate to being the fat beneficiary of an empire, but did understand that English was coming into its own as a major international commercial tongue, and therefore these books were available.

Jump cut to more recent years, a little more money in the pocket, travel behind me, internet blooming and the discovery of the dark wit of Irvine Welsh, and I began to see certain artists (aforementioned Welsh, plus William Gibson, Octavia Butler, to name a few), as celebrating the ability of the beleaguered masses to emerge from all the trash-heaps, acquire weird skills that are somehow worth money now, and be these sort of mutant successes. Thus, it is not in a `canon' of Polish literature that I consumed Snow White and Russian Red, when I came across it, but instead as a finely rendered, single malt Scotch, created by a 21 year old phenomenon, available to everyone in the world market.

I think it's too simplistic to say that Maslowska's anti-hero Nails, the tirade-prone speed freak, is just `caught between worlds.' Instead, the author speaks for a young, cosmopolitan generation that knows that whether you call it `communism' or `capitalism', we are only animals struggling for resources. What we can do to pluck our share has become bizarre, as espoused by the character Magda, who has dumped Nails and can sell her beauty both locally and abroad, or in the direct and thieving Natasha, who will snatch valuable speed out of your house like a drug-hungry Viking.

Jump cut back to Polish Lit: there are, I suppose, even in English, a few echoes of the grand voice in Maslowska's prose. All the characters are prone to tirades (even sort of sound like each other sometimes). Milosz is capable of some long poems, and writes a damn lot of them. The breadth of both their voices (albeit in translation), is like someone shouting into a valley, is notably different from the rat-a-tat sparky words from writers in the U.S. and U.K. It is closer to an older sounding literature-the fact that Milosz, a poet, can have such fame, is a bizarre sort of resurrection of the archaic, and a figure like, say, Robert Creeley, an American poet, doesn't have it in the common consciousness in the U.S. (Milosz may even be more well known in the U.S. than Creeley).

But what strikes me the most here, is that she makes fun of the anti-corporate mindset. Where in the West, in what I'll lump together as "literary, surrealist and sci-fi literature" the sympathy almost always goes with someone who is earnestly struggling against corporations, Nails, Maslowska's anti-hero, is made fun of for being totally lazy and unrealistic about economics. He is a do-nothing clown, a complainer whose thoughts are entertaining, but ultimately lead to his demise.

Whereas Bruce Robertson, the anti-hero of Irvine Welsh's novel Filth, breaks down at the end, seems to see his own faults, Maslowska's Nails gets locked up in the book itself, condemned to a hell of being 2-dimensional, always in the comic book, unable to realize that he is the tragic clown. Welsh's Robertson is a crooked cop who seems to take some genuine joy in the exchange of money and capitalism, even saying the "bloke who invented the Kit-Kat ought to be well-[bleeping] knighted"; and yet it's hinted at, when we learn his origins, that he might not have ever been born if the anti-abortion sentiments of his mother's family and community had allowed her to get rid of a pregnancy that was the result of a rape.

Maslowska's Nails, one the other hand, while quite the consumer of fast food and drugs, espouses a strong color of hypocrisy. He eats "Bird-Milkies" the rough equivalent of the Kit-Kat in Filth, but he reviles the capitalist factories that made them. He is a new species of anti-hero: "The lazy-leftist" party boy, bright enough to be funny, yet somehow paralyzed from taking enough joy in anything to work at it. Not that the book isn't critical of the cheapness of Western capitalism; it makes fun of college-primed, corporate bound nerdy types as well-it's just that gone is the idea that a complaint is enough without a solution.

Which, I think, is also why Maslowska includes herself as a character in the book. We get a look at her personal process, her attempts to get an education, her tenacity. She wrote this book at 21, astonishing, and incidentally, the same age I was being taught Milosz and the others in an American state college. Snow White and Russian Red comes through thus as both a tribute and an indictment-a tribute to the author (and reader's, any reader's) ability to remain steadfast with a project, to incorporate humorous setbacks into life's architecture, and at the same time accuse anyone who thinks human economics, anywhere, East or West, has ever been a free dinner. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R13008FSCDOZV0/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802170013&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Carl Moore]

*****
"The Scottish writer David I. Masson (1917-2007) published only a few short stories, the great bulk in the mid-60s in New Worlds, with three more following in anthologies in the early '70s. The New Worlds stories were collected in an anthology, The Caltraps of Time, in 1968. This book was reissued in 2003 with the other stories also included -- this is the edition I review here. The 5 star rating, I note is for the peaks -- the collection is uneven, but the best stories are unmissable.

"Traveller's Rest", his first and most famous story, does not disappoint. It is the story of a soldier fighting in a curious war. The opponent is not seen, not known. Apparently, the two sides fight across an impassable timelike barrier -- for their world is curiously constructed as to time flow. Near the barrier, time flows slower and slower, so much so that communication is impossible except over short distances. The change in rate of time is a feature throughout the world, but at greater distances from the barrier the time rate delta per linear distance flattens -- the overall curve seems a hyperbola. The soldier is relieved, and returns to the most inhabited areas, of relatively flat time gradients -- but of course it is long past the time he left. So he makes a new life, marries, has children -- and all these decades only minutes have passed at the front. Which hints at the inevitable conclusion. Masson's story has multiple lovely features -- some cute linguistic inventions, some nice explorations of the effects of even small time gradients, and a moving personal story. It provides real SFnal sense of wonder -- complete with a bitter and logical twist right at the conclusion. Outstanding.

The rest of the collection is not quite as good, but it is still well worth reading. Masson's abiding SFnal interests seemed to be time (and parallel worlds); and linguistic invention (including linguistic change over time). In some ways I am reminded of Ted Chiang, actually, particularly in a story like "Mouth of Hell" but also in "Traveller's Rest" and a few others. Indeed, in a lot of ways. (Noting, of course, that Masson was mining this territory before Chiang.)

My favorite among the other stories was "Lost Ground". Somewhat like "Traveller's Rest", Masson combines a couple of ideas. The first is a future in which weather is dominated by emotion-causing "fronts" -- a "bitter spell" might be in the forecast, or a "panic attack" -- the latter of which causes the death of the son of the two main characters. Then, oddly, but successfully, he introduces another notion -- time displacements -- places where you might suddenly walk to another time. (Reminiscent of Gordon Dickson's novel Time Storm, but again Masson was there first.) The wife vanishes in one, and the husband determines to follow her in, but these time displacements are not so predictable. The conclusion is quite moving.

Probably his other best known story is "A Two-Timer", in which a man from the 17th Century happens upon a time machine and accidentally makes his way to our time. Masson has a great deal of fun with the linguistic differences, and of course also the differences in attitudes. "Psychosmosis" is another highlight. It's set in a curiously different place, where mentioning the name of a dead person results in immediate disappearance. Thus any namesakes of a newly died person must change their names. But accidents still happen. The story examines the consequences of a few such accidents -- somewhat surprising results. This is one of those just plain weird ideas that may not make much sense but simply impress the reader with the writer's imagination.

In "The Transfinite Choice" a far future overpopulated Earth happens upon a means of reducing population pressure after the discovery of alternate worlds, separate from ours by an infinitesimal time interval. Of course, there is a (guessable) problem with this solution. Masson's most conventional SF story might be "Not So Certain", which is set on another planet, and deals with the problems caused by slightly imprecise translations of an alien language. Plausible, but really not terribly interesting. "Mouth of Hell" concerns a dangerous expedition to an apparently infinitely deep valley in the surface of the world. The title suggests what that valley might be, but Hell as such is not really dealt with in the story.

Finally, the three new stories are all somewhat weaker. Moreover, they are terribly bitter, indeed dyspeptic. Sometime between 1967 and 1970 Masson seems to have given up on the future of the human race. "The Show Must Go On" is not a story so much as a parade of descriptions of murder and violence -- mostly ignored -- in a decayed future. "Doctor Fausta" is the best of these late stories. A man meets a duplicate of himself and learns that it is possible to go to a parallel world, slightly different. It turns out his duplicate has a reason for convincing the man to switch universes, to do with a petty crime ring. Much of the story, however, has fun with the somewhat goofy linguistic differences between the two similar but not identical universes. Finally, "Take It or Leave It" contrasts two differing futures -- a not exactly utopian but livable, if busy, future and a bitter post-apocalypse future. The main point seemed again to be simply displaying a dyspeptic view of humanity -- there was little story (though some decent imagination).

Masson's best stories are profoundly worth continued attention, and this collection, though uneven, is absolutely worth reading." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XXX5NAF0ZZVY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0575118288[Richard R. Horton]

"As a small child of 10 of so, I was a teacher's brat who practically lived in the local public library of the small California town where Mum taught. In the course of my many trips to the library I discovered a small, whimsically illustrated book about a war between two nations, one comprised of fat people and the other peopled by thin ones. It was a wonderfully droll account of war between two nations over the silliest and most nonsensical of philosophies and I was terribly impressed by the moral admonishment it contained about the eternal senselessness of human warfare. That was in 1956. 51 years later, I was still trying to remember the salient identifying details of the book well enough to locate a copy for my personal library. I remembered the characters only as 'The Fattifers and the Thinnifers', although that was not an accurate title for the book. To my great fortune, I recently happened across a passing reference by someone on the internet about the book (in a totally different context) and was able to finally obtain the author's name, an accurate title, and an ISBN for this jewel of an allegorical children's book. The book was written originally back in the early 1930s by Frenchman Andre Maurois for his sons and its title was 'Fattypuffs and Thinifers' (or 'Patapoufs et Filifers' in French). Illustrated beautifully by Jean Bruller, this brilliantly witty (and highly ironic) parable about a war between fat people and thin people was not lost on me--even as a child. Some years afterwards I joined the uniformed Vietnam War protest while serving in the US Air Force and came back to Berkeley (CA) upon my discharge, where I ended up on the student barricades with Mario Savio and the other guiding lights of the Free Speech Movement of the 60s. Although as an admirer of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, I fully appreciated the greater benefit of thining out the world's population of thoughtless idiots that war bestows on us, I have incidentally been opposed to war all of my life. I am convinced that, aside from having read Proust and Hugo at an early age, my accidental encounter with Andre Maurois' marvelous book at a tender age resulted in that preference for diplomacy over bloodshed. Whether one is of warlike sentiment or totally in opposition to war, Maurois' wonderful parable about the essential folly of war is not to be missed. Suitable for children from 6 through 99, it is one of those books that every well-read and reflectively intelligent individuial should have in his or her library. If you are not terribly impressed after reading this timeless book, there's essentially no hope for you, friend, and in that case the Bush administration has a place for you on its Pentagon War Planning Staff as the outgoing Administration gears up for an invasion of Iran.

[It never hurts to recall Norwegian composer Carl Nielsen's famous quote "Patriotism has become a spiritual syphilis that devours the brains and grins out through empty eye sockets with moronic hate!", before bounding off into renewed battle with the 'enemy du jour']. There is a timelessness about this book that everyone would do well to familiarise themselves with, I think...child or Pentagon Chief of Staff alike. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLI04GOYWHY32/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1903252075[Kalikiano Kalei]

"IN THE twenty-first century, Lanny Martin dictates a memory-tape report of that awful week back in 1993 when the XP machine nearly destroyed civilization. The XP machine tape-records any human activity (yes, including that one), then plays it back so that anyone else can relive the same experience. And you can turn up the volume.

Martin works for ConChem, the glutcorp that owns everything…except the XP machine and its tapes. But nobody buys things anymore, except the bare nutrients required for survival. XP tapes of gourmet meals and other sensual activities are now outselling the actual experiences. Eventually, Martin saves ConChem's profit line…by acquiring XP, then using its technology to offer free samples of whatever people want. To get the full experience, they'll have to pay.

Shepherd Mead's future year 1993 is semi-plausible. Remember those picture-phones which every 1960s oracle predicted would arrive soon? Mead's future world has them, with one (very convincing) addition explaining why they never caught on in our own timeline. Mead's other predictions are less impressive. Lanny Martin drives a 1992 Buick to Idyllwild (sic) Airport, and he encounters "a colored fellow."

Shepherd Mead (1914-1994) joined an ad agency as the mailroom boy, and left two decades later as their vice president; this experience inspired his best-seller How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying. He also wrote the 1965 SF novel The Carefully Considered Rape of the World." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2008/cur0807.htm[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]

Ok, so to be totally honest, the title of this book was originally what compelled me to check it out. How can you not take a second look with a name like "The Carefully Considered Rape of the World: A Novel About the Unspeakable", if only to just find out what it is about! So I read the novel's synopsis, and surprise (!), it is not even remotely what I expected; it was so weird and imaginative sounding. After that I knew, I MUST read this book. And guess what? It was AWESOME! So far this has been my favorite read of the year. It's a funny, irreverent science-fiction in a similar vein to "The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy". It starts with women across the world- whether widows, virgins, lesbians, nuns, single or married all becoming pregnant after a visit from a door to door perfume tester. He spritzes, they black out for a couple minutes, next thing they know they are pregnant. But this isn't a pyscho rapist on the loose; it is actually a species of genius ape aliens. They want to invade the earth without a big uprising, so the best way to do it they decide it to implant women with their babies through a gas like substance and then promote their landing with a huge international public relations campaign. Comedic sci-fi hilarity ensues, along with some seriously thought provoking ideas. Long story short, don't let the title scare you, this book is absolutely fantastic!! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1K5ZP5ULU39/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006U5VF80&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Outerspace Andrea]

*****
Novellas usually focus on a situation, and Herman Melville’s most famous (and perhaps most successful) incursion into the genre is a magnificent example. The text bears as its title the protagonist’s name, but this figure is so enigmatic that we cannot justly call _Bartleby, the Scrivener_ (1853) a character study. The situation explored is extra-ordinary, yet simple: an employee refuses to do his job. Like most of the literary giants of the nineteenth century, Melville wrote a novel that secured him a place in the canon, _Moby Dick_ (1851), but he also produced exquisite novellas. Because our society values quantity, voluminous novels are often favored, but it seems to me that it is more difficult to produce a memorable novella than a memorable novel. _Bartleby_ is, if you ask me, just as impressive as _Moby Dick_; it simply has different narrative purposes.

_Bartleby_ is a psychological mystery that prefigures the work of Franz Kafka. Melville understands the anxiety of modern life, especially the form it takes in our cities. The novella’s subtitle is “A Story of Wall Street.” Bartleby is an ordinary man, just like Ivan Ilyich in that other famous novella (please see my review). It is not clear why the protagonist all of a sudden decides to rebel and reply to every request with, “I would rather not do it.” Can we even call them acts of rebellion? This is part of the mystery of Bartleby, and because the novella (unlike the short story) doesn’t rely on revelation, the mystery remains even after one has closed the book. Short stories and novels tend to answer the questions they raise; the novella simply enjoys raising questions. It is more often than not an open text, and there lies its charm: we may continue to discuss it, and as we do so we participate in the creative process. The narrator does not really tell us who Bartleby is. He lest us decide.

Whether conscious or not, Bartleby’s curt reply is a challenge to pragmatism and the Protestant work ethic, two of the tenets of American society. In a society that regards almost everything--including human beings--in terms of its practical value or usefulness, Bartleby makes himself useless. The year after the publication of _Bartleby_, Henry David Thoreau would write, “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” Bartleby incarnates this silent cry of despair.

Novellas, you will find, may often be described fairly in one short sentence. What is _The Death of Ivan Ilych_ about? It’s about a man who becomes aware of his mortality. What is _The Metamorphosis_ about? It’s about a man who tries to adapt after finding himself turned into a bug. This is also true of _Bartleby_, and of that other literary gem that is _Benito Cereno_ (1855). Both of these novellas are included in _The Piazza Tales_ (1856), along with three short stories and a collection of sketches on the Galápagos Islands. The novella is the genre of repetition and reexamination. We may feel the text has us going around in circles, and in a sense it does. The movement is circular, but we do not come back to the exact same place: the novella has a spiral structure. Bartleby repeats, “I would rather not,” but every time he says it it’s different.

I observed that the novella does not rest on a revelation. In the case of _Bartleby_, there is a revelation at the end, as the narrator tries to make sense of his unaccommodating employee, but rather than providing answers this revelation leads only to more uncertainty. The nucleus of the novella is unknowable. The novella is a series of conjectures that revolve around a void. The more we ask, the less we know.

_Bartleby, the Scrivener_ is one of the best American novellas ever written, by one of the American masters of the novella. It is no coincidence that a publishing house that focuses on the novella has chosen the name Melville House. And yes, they do have an edition of _Bartleby_. This novella is so refreshing within the Melville corpus that it will delight both lovers and haters of _Moby Dick_, for basically the same reasons. If you enjoy _Bartleby_, I recommend _Billy Budd_ and _Benito Cereno_, in that order. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25GWF2FCR47ED/[Benito Cerino]

*****
Here's a truly charming 19th Century fantasy from the acclaimed Victorian novelist & poet George Meredith, written in his youth. In what was obviously a labor of love, Meredith pours his considerable childhood affection for the Arabian Nights into this tale of a humble but heroic Persian barber, Shibli Bagarag, who finds himself charged with the quest of shaving the impressive beard of the powerful clothier Shagpat ... but let Meredith's own words introduce the story:

"Now the story of Shibli Bagarag, and of the ball he followed, and of the subterranean kingdom he came to, and of the enchanted palace he entered, and of the sleeping king he shaved, and of the two princesses he released, and of the Afrite held in subjection by the arts of one and bottled by her, is it not known as 'twere written on the finger-nails of men and traced in their corner robes?"

With the aid of the enchantress Noorna, Shibli Bagarag sets out on his journey, all related in the faux-Orientalist prose of the above excerpt. Those looking for even a tenuous relationship to the reality of the Middle East will look in vain; this is an Arabia of Western fancy, an Antipodes of the Western psyche. Clearly this won't appeal to everyone, so be warned. But when taken on its own terms, it's no less enjoyable & convincing than any faux-Medieval fantasy of today. And frankly, it's a lot more fun!

Returned to print by the legendary Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series some 40 years ago, this particular edition features the typically lush & vibrant cover art of those volumes, in this case by Ray Cruz, along with a short & enthusiastic introduction by editor Lin Carter. It's a perfect example of the possibilities of the heroic (or mock-heroic) fantasy, before the genre became so bogged down in overly-detailed literalism & poor mimicry of Tolkien, many times removed from the original source. If you can find a copy, you may be in for a delightful surprise -- recommended! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DO8EA6MNPLL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034501958X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[William Timothy Lukeman]

"'On the Shoulders of Giants' (which shall hereafter be referred to as OTSOG) is the quintessential study of the nature of academicism. It is thinly disguised as a dissertation into the origin (and originality) of Newton's famous aphorism 'If I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.' However, once the reader finds himself confronted by what might or might not be an attack on Richard Burton (the one that wrote 'The Anatomy of Melancholy'), suspicions grow, and in short order one begins to understand that a leg or two is being pulled.

Of course, it does not end there. Displaying the kind of dazzling scholarship that most academics can only aspire to, Merton zigzags across the intellectual horizon on a quest for the lighter side of truth. In doing so, he exposes many of the pretensions of scholarly work, plagiarism and specious logic. Leaving no stone unturned, we are as likely to find ourselves in pursuit of Tristram Shandy as we are to be wandering through the transept of Chartres Cathedral. All in a mad search to uncover who really used OTSOG first.

It needs to be said that Merton is, on his own, an extremely respected sociologist, one who often has used the scientific and academic world as the focus of his remarkable eye. OTSOG sets out to make points by mimicking its subjects rather than lecturing about them. Whimsical and witty, it still touches on serious issues while exposing a great deal of fascinating minutia. Certainly it is a one of a kind work that enjoys a large cult following among those who are reluctant to take themselves seriously. Look out for Umberto Eco's foreword and Merton's riposte-face as well." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N2R21XJN3EGT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151699623[Marc Ruby]

"Serendipity is an interesting concept and term that has an interesting history. It pretty much means "unintended fortunate find or discovery" and it has caught on in many fields from literature to the social and natural sciences. It's an important part of science that is often overlooked or not really emphasized in popular science writings. Discoveries in science are not linear or expected most of time and the serendipitous/complex reality that is encountered by actual scientists in their daily work is often ignored for more ideal and simple narratives of how science works in real time. This particular book was cited in Nobel Prizes and Life Sciences which emphasized the influence on serendipity on Nobel prize winning discoveries.

"The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity" is a pretty extensive book in looking at the etymology and the history of the term from its origin in the 1700s so it will be very useful for those interested in etymologies and how words travel through time. Furthermore, though this book was originally written in 1958 and was barely published in 2002 and 2003, with its original text intact and essentially unaltered, it may not be up to date to the beginning of the 21st century. Nonetheless, the practical use "serendipity" had already reached popularity in the late 1950s and the autobiography by Merton does provide some insights as to the use of the word up to the year 2000. Of particular interest to me was the origin of the term. Who would have thought that a fairy tale would inspire a cultural and scientific concept? There was no word in English that successfully captured what serendipity was able to catch in such a practical and simple way. Go figure. Even William Whewell, the wordsmith who coined many important technical scientific terms (neologism) which we are familiar with (i.e. physicist, anode, cathode, ion, etc) in the 19th century including the term "scientist" in 1834, seemed to have missed the opportunity to conceptualize the phenomenon of accidental discoveries/insights that do occur in scientific research. For sure it took a long time before the idea and the term caught on. It was dormant for 79 years after Horace Walpole had coined it in 1754 in a letter to Horace Mann. In 1833 this letter was published and the rest is history." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8V8Q64FSXHU8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691126305[Clandestine Library]

"This is a great book, particularly for those interested in knowing more about the Herman Melville legacy. The writer of this text is Herman Melville’s grandson, and a good portion of this book showcases the author’s thoughts while forcing himself to come to terms with his place in this legacy. However, this is not a documentary book or a biography, so please don’t dive into this literature with inappropriate expectations.

Paul Metcalf’s style is also worth mentioning here. He appropriates text from other writers, in proper form for a postmodernist like himself. For this reason, his writing style reads more like poetry than prose in many instances. I say this because his use of short excerpts breaks down the sentence/paragraph organizational structure in a way that makes it feel less simple narrative and more like quasi-verse.

As was mentioned before, Paul Metcalf takes portions of writings from Christopher Columbus’s memoires, segments from Herman Melville’s books and biographies, and fragments from medical journals (along with many other texts) to assist in the writing of his book. Thus, the continuity of Genoa is broken up by sedimentations from all of these texts. On every page, the author executes multiple double carriage returns (implying that the texts are nested amidst one another, as if initiating a chain of block quotes) to emphasize the textual cross-pollination each insertion provides the topic at hand. Some literary critics explain this style as an assemblage or a juxtaposition used to mythologize events. Thus, analogies or similitudes are not merely revealed for their own sake, but serve to further confound events, relationships, and characters in a meaningful way. Another description, this time by Guy Davenport (eminent writer, artist, and critic), describes this style as “architecture,” since a building up or sedimentation of meaning occurs as bricks/layers from many outside texts are integrated together. The connecting mortar is provided by the writer as Metcalf combines all this together to generate a structure precisely organized to produce meaning.

Also, within this book, motifs such as deformity, violence, and fantasy are elaborated upon. Indeed, Paul Metcalf uses this eccentric style to grapple with some pretty meaty subjects. I will not give the plot of the story away, but the ending of this book is quite fascinating, telling, and unexpected, a book well worth trudging one’s way though even if you are not always satisfied with the author’s digressive and meandering style. Give it a chance and you will find something worthwhile here." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK6H95TJNXBCE/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566893925[Zendigo]

The first part is WILL WEST about a Cherokee ball player. Will West goes to his mother to tell her he has quit the ball team and that he has killed a woman. She gives him the money he has sent to her to escape punishment. This work and the others in the volume consists of both poetry and prose. The story moves from Will and his traveling with a truck driver named Ferd to the Civil War and De Soto the Spanish explorer.

The work GENOA follows. We are in the city of Indianapolis, Crawford County. In the past Indiana was probably a rank lush swamp. Metcalf cites and quotes the works and biography of his ancestor, Herman Melville.

The narrator's brother Carl died in the electric chair. Michael Mills is a nonpracticing physician, a house husband. This work, as is the case with the previous one and others in this volume, has a mixed media feel to it, something virtually homespun. The work of Metcalf, as Melville's, is filled with medical lore, sea lore, scientific lore, and explorers' tales.

Carl Mills went to Alaska, to Spain to fight with the Loyalists, to China to participate in World War II in the RAF where he was put into a Japanese POW camp and tortured. The history of Christopher Columbus is used in GENOA. Columbus and Melville were both men of vision.

Carl ended up in St. Louis at the center of things. The narrator visited him and found him reading THE CONFIDENCE MAN. Carl said later in a mental hospital quoting that work that a sick philosopher is incurable.

A portion on Theodore Dreiser reminds me of USA, John Dos Passos. The crime resulting in the execution is a combination of fiction and history. GENOA and the latter sections in the volume have bibliographies. GENOA, in the collage-like use of materials, resembles EXECUTIONER'S SONG and leaves the reader with the same sadness.

PATAGONI is the third work of the collection. As indicated by the title it is a derivation of the place name Patagonia. We visit the world presented to explorers of the Amazon and the Andes. Henry Ford is a character in PATAGONI. The work owes a nod to William Carlos Williams, mentioned, and his poem PATERSON. Sialia is Indian for bluebird, the name of Ford's yacht.

The next section is the MIDDLE PASSAGE, and the final one is called APALACHE. They concern for the most part and in great detail North America. An exception is a wonderful treatment of the Luddite Riots. In terms of time one moves from geological pre-human history through Eric the Red and Roger Williams and Blackstone, dissenters from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to the Civil Rights Movement.

Paul Metcalf is a master of his craft. Where have I been, I ask myself, to have not encountered his work earlier." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUCVAPR8L0TH4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566890500[Mary E. Sibley]

[[A_Barbarian_in_Asia]]
*A Barbarian in Asia (1933, 1986)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811209911/Amazon]

*****
For the weird surrealist poet cum travelogue writer, Henri Michaux, as "barbarian" from culture capital of surrealism and Tahitian fantasy, Paris, travel (here using the travelogue as poetic ethnographic genre) enacted and mimed a form of self abnegation, a way of abandoning habits and smug values; with the culturally coded "I" fleeing from its past into a perpetual present which is always outside itself, always other (beholding, praying to, invoking the other).

Asian peoples were for this poet traveller of altered states, "the last resistants" to western monotony; everywhere in A Barbarian In Asia Michaux exults in excess, difference, makes poetic propaganda "for an endless variety of civilizations" by which to counter the idea of only one (monologue). His 'orientalism' is made explicit, ironic, and exaggerated enough to become what I would call, tonally, "mock orientalism," such as claiming that political domination is hard "even for an Asiatic."

Particular national or local cultures comprise for Michaux a hybrid personality "of a thousand different elements"; each culture in Asia provides a kind of sensuous style and confronts the barbaric outsider as a landscape not of humanistic sameness but of utter estrangement and a halting of predictable codes. Going beyond Marxist analysis and Christian pieties, Michaux contends that a miner's strike should be supplemented, and is, by "a miner's civilization."

Michaux journeys into cultural co existence: "To avoid war construct peace." That is, to avoid the monologue of imperialism, both political and cultural, construct estranging dialogues and multiple styles, interrogations of oriental and occidental, so called civilized and so called barbaric. Rather than a conversion experience into the commodity form there should be a conversion through voicing otherness, outsidedness. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AE6NQS0T7E37/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811209911&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Rob Wilson]

*****
There are books, usually paperback originals, you used to find everywhere. Every used bookstore in the US had two copies, and I'm just not talking about bestsellers, either. How many copies of The Mucous-Free Diet have you had to move to find something good, or Sidelong Glances of a Pigeon-Kicker?

You once could find copies of this one everywhere. You can't anymore, and it's a shame.

In the novel, a retired general disappears. His aide sets out to find him. He goes through the general's recent papeers and letters, and finds he's been corresponding with just about every nut-cult and proto-New Age crank you could have in those just-post Kennedy Assassination days. Health cranks, cancer quacks, space-brothers; there's a guy who wants to build a tower to the Moon with the help of the Indiana National Guard. The aide realizes Something's Up, and the general's on his way there.

The book is somewhere between fabulation, satire, and flat-out warning (the best analogy I can think of is a collaboration between Gabriel García Márquez and the Coen brothers . . .). It was written in the time of Au + H20 = 1964 and Dr. Strangelove. The hunt for the general becomes a search for what's happening to the U.S. (is something really changing? Or is the truth just finally coming out?). You read it and you begin to think Raymond Chandler was wrong when he said there's nothing the matter with America a 300-foot rise in sea-level wouldn't fix. There is a near-Apocalypse ending.

Miller was best known for his straight novel The Cool World (1959) and his one political sf/thriller, The Siege of Harlem (also 1964). But in this one, he was the avatar of the zeitgeist. He died in 1966, before most of the things he wrote about in this book came to pass. He caught a whiff of the last third of the century, and it smelled a lot like chaos and burning flesh.

Remember, this was written in 1964, before the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution: There's a throwaway scene as the aide's driving out of DC on the start of his hunt for the general. He describes the neighborhoods he's passing through: post-WWI renovations, post-WWII tract housing, post-Korean War homes, post-Vietnam War suburbs . . .

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Lud-----Mist-Hope-Mirrlees/dp/1434442179/[Amazon]

*****
The oddness of this story can be detected just by checking out the main character. Most fantasy heroes are not round, stodgy, middle-aged men who are respected pillars of the community.

But Hope Mirrlees' enchanting fantasy "Lud-in-the-Mist" defies many such fantasy cliches, written as if "The Hobbit" had been spun up by Lord Dunsany. It's a sweet pastoral story that slowly blossoms out into a very unique story -- there's a little murder mystery, an amusing village of hobbity people, and a quicksilver dream of beautiful fairyland and otherworldly danger.

Fairy is forbidden in the town of Lud -- not just fairy creatures and their exquisite fruit, but mentions of them, the dead who walk with them, and the Duke Aubrey who left with them.

But all his life, the steadfastly dull Mayor Nathaniel Chanticleer has a lingering longing/fear for a strangely magical musical note. Despite all this, life remains boring and rather pleasant -- until Chanticleer's son Ranulph begins acting strangely, claiming that he's eaten fairy fruit.

After Chanticleer sends his son off to a farm for a vacation, the teenage girls at Miss Primrose's Crabapple Academy suddenly seem to go pleasantly nuts, and then race off into the hills. Life seems to seep out of the old town,and Nathaniel must connect the present crises to a past conspiracy, all of which hinges on Fairyland, fairy fruit, and the sinister doctor Endymion Leer. The journey to discover the truth will take him out of the everyday world -- and change him forever.

Haunting music, mad dancing, and ethereal meadows filled with fairy people and strange flowers. All through "Lud-in-the-Mist," there's the underlying feeling that there's a frightening, exquisite world that is barely separated from ours. Rather than cliche elves with pointy ears, it relies on a dreamlike atmosphere and faraway lands that are only glimpsed in passing.

Originally written in 1926, Hope Mirrlees' third book is an utterly unique experience -- it takes place in a pleasantly ordinary British town and charming pastoral towns, with fairy magic seeping into the cracks. And it's something of a love ode to "fairy" -- even though the inhabitants of Lud cherish their prosperous, staid existance, the the strange and exquisite blooms over the course of the book.

And Mirrlees' writing is capable of bringing that to life -- she intertwines a fantasy, a murder mystery and a personal journey into one. The first part of the book is written in a pleasantly cozy, mellow style that focuses on the colourful, staid town of Lud. But as the story blossoms into a tangle of crises and mysteries, Mirrlees' writing becomes more lush, exquisite and haunting.

Chanticleer is very reminiscent of Bilbo Baggins -- he's pleasant, boring, stodgy but has a brave, eccentric interior that helps him become a very unusual hero. And the other inhabitants of Lud are similarly engaging and just a little bit quirky -- fairy-struck teenagers, snippy old ladies, the haughty farmer's wife, the quietly malevolent Endymion Leer, and the happily mad people.

"Lud-in-the-Mist" emerged before the mold was made for fantasy novels, and its exquisitely funny writing shows why it's an enduring classic. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CG1PZD15T84/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434442179&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E. A. Solinas]

*****
The back cover of this small volume boasts a blurb, which proclaims, "Monterroso is certainly the leading living Guatemalan writer..." Not being quite an expert on Guatemalan literature myself, I cannot personally vouch for this statement. What I can swear to, however, is the fact that this compilation of writings by Augusto Monterroso is a collection of brilliant short fictions, which quickly call to mind the works of Swift, Sterne, Kafka, J.L. Borges, and Italo Calvino (among others). Reminiscent of Borges, Monterroso is a master of the self-referential (art about art/books about books); his fictions abound with tales of the weaknesses and general absurdities of writers (and other story-tellers), bibliophiles, reviewers, critics, researchers, musicians, artists and other intellectual and historical figures who may or may not be "real." Like his predecessors, Monterroso's fictions often challenge our assumptions about literature and its conventions. He freely plays with the forms of fiction; there are short stories

"disguised" as letters, essays, and aphorisms. Several of his stories are far shorter in length than the literary quotes he uses to introduce them. One of these, "The Dinosaur," (perhaps his most well-known work) is a mere 8 words long ("When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there."). In other instances, his fictions mirror the rambling nature of the spoken word itself, as they amble on and meander for some 3 or 4 pages without a single bit of punctuation prior to the concluding period.

Like his (above mentioned) literary forbearers, Monterroso is a master of satire, irony, and the absurd. Resembling Swift ("A Modest Proposal"), Kafka, and Borges before him, Monterroso uses a precise, crisp and almost dispassionate writing style to put forth the most absurd and outrageous of fictions. In "Finished Symphony," for example, he casually relates having overheard in passing, someone tell of the discovery, and then destruction of the two lost movements of Schubert's great "Unfinished Symphony." In other instances, his irony can be self-deprecating. "Leopoldo (His Labors)," for instance, is a short story about a reluctant short story writer, who is eternally frustrated in his decades-long attempt to write his first perfect(and never finished)short story. This entire piece of fiction is a virtuoso bit of satire upon the author, himself (and perhaps on all authors). And what could be more absurd, or more comically inspired than "Flies": "There are three themes; love, death, and flies...Let others deal with the first two. I concern myself with flies...In the beginning was the fly...It is easier for a fly to land on the nose of the Pope, than for the Pope to land on the nose of a fly...Oh, Melville, you had to sail the seas before you could finally set that great white whale on your desk in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, not realizing that Evil had long ago circled your strawberry ice cream..."

Monterroso is clearly one of the important figures in the development of modern and contemporary Latin-American fiction. Along with such writers as Bioy Casares, J.L. Borges, Gabriel Marquez, Carlos Fuentes, Tomas Eloy Martinez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Julio Cortazar (as well as Italo Calvino, Tomasso Landolfi, John Barth, and Milan Kundera), Monterroso is a brilliant exponent of "Magic Realism". If you admire any of the aforementioned authors, I would urge you to look into this dazzling collection by an inspired writer. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUL158ZVCSEJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0292751842&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[David C.

[[Dantes_Inferno]]
*Dante's Inferno: A Comedy* (2015)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0557154812/[Amazon]

*****
My favorite books are literary curiosities that defy description, such as Tristram Shandy, Nabokov's Pale Fire or Beckett's Watt. "Dante's Inferno, A Comedy" by Declan Moran belongs squarely in this category. Like the epic poem at the heart of Pale Fire, Moran's "translation" is, on its own, artful, entertaining, surprisingly lyrical and true to the substance of the original. But the actual poem is only the starting point for the extreme literary madness of this bizarre and intelligent satire.

Moran's "translated poem" is on the left side of each page; on the right is a summary of and commentary on Dante's original for comparison. And this is where the literary insanity begins. For Moran's version of Dante's descent into hell, while true to the spirit and structure of the original, is a clever, high-IQ romp into meta-storytelling and anarchic satire.

Not only is the commentary on the poem a witty take-off on scholarly "notated editions" of the classics, but this section also has its own separate section of footnotes further notating the notations. These notations are worthy of Monty Python, co-mingling high-IQ, self-referential humor with low-brow jokes, a combination that had me either shaking my head in disbelief or bursting out laughing.

Hats off to Moran for his cajones, attempting something this original, complicated and sophisticated. Like one of the other reviewers, I'd be curious so see if his next literary project lambastes another classical masterpiece, or if he'll branch out into an entirely different literary mode.

I haven't even touched on the ridiculous backstory of the "translation", which Moran attributes to two legendary artist brothers dedicated to creating works which will make them notorious, universally hated, and get them beheaded by the reigning monarchy. Nor have I mentioned the witty chart which is a Who's Who of historical, literary and modern day celebs, showing which level of hell they occupy, or are destined for. I also didn't mention the book's illustrations, also executed by Moran who is a visual artist. The professional illustrations are the most conspicuous elements of this weird and unique book, which give it a post-modern feel rather than an antiquated one.

The only thing I would criticize is that I wished there was a "wrap up" at the end, perhaps an epilogue from the anarchic brothers who supposedly wrote the book. Something to "top" the final Canto, Dante's descent into the core of the earth where he has to climb down the giant frozen body of Lucifer to reach the River of Forgetfulness that will bring him home. Other than wishing there was a comic epilogue, I'm obviously a fan and give this book a big thumbs up. I would definitely recommend it to readers who crave an amusing, artful and unique literary experience. This is it, in spades.

Summing up, I'll quote part of Moran's eccentric prologue to the book, which he echoes at the very end:

"Remember, if you can imagine it, you

can make it be, that everything is made

[mostly] of nothing, that belief is a power

like no other - and that the human soul

does love a good mystery." - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AZE5Y9I5D6YH/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0557154812[E. Martin Olson]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Where-blue-begins-divine-comedy/dp/B00005X685/[Amazon]

*****
Christopher Morley, (1890-1957), is remembered primarily as an essayist, novelist and poet whose most well known works, ("Parnassus on Wheels" and "The Haunted Bookshop"), followed the experiences of bookseller Roger Mifflin. He was one of the founders of "The Saturday Review of Books", and collaborated with the likes of Don Marquis, (of "Archy and Mehitabel" fame), and Ogden Nash. He was very much a man of his literary, New York City times and was known to be gregarious and good humored. All of that is abundantly evident in this book, which is a testament to his enduring appeal.

"Where the Blue Begins" was written in 1922, a few years after the Mifflin novels, and is generally categorized as a "satirical novel", but that's a bit harsh given its rather genial tone. The characters are all recognizable human types, but presented in the physical guise of dogs. This allows for a great deal of sly humor involving tale wagging, wet noses, and the like, and some even more subtle jokes allowing dog species to stand in as character comments; (what species of dog would you choose to be the local vicar?). When you think about it, T.S. Eliot did the same sort of thing for cats, and I'd actually read Henry James if it had more cows and horses.

Anyway, our hero, Gissing, goes gallivanting off to seek new horizons, (where the blue begins), and has adventures. The results are amusing and instructive. This can be read as a child's adventure tale or as a more serious contemplative work, depending on one's inclinations and situation.
However you approach it, this is an accomplished work by a gifted author at the height of his powers. It suffers not at all from being dated; it may even work better now for that reason. Certainly a cheerful choice as a why-not? - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWUK765DS2UR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005X685&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Pop Bop]

*Thunder on the Left* (1925)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Thunder-Left-Christopher-Morley/dp/1443734918/[Amazon]

*****
TO CONCOCT a unique fantasy novel, mix a dash of Virginia Woolf's interior monologues, a jigger of Robert Nathan's whimsy, a soupçon of Noel Coward's witty sophistication, a handful of Kuttneresque children, and a pinch of Robert Aickman's eerie atmospherics. Stir all ingredients in the blender of Christopher Morley's talents, and the result is the airy yet grave comedy-cum-ghost-story Thunder on the Left, whose mysterious title derives from an apocryphal quote concerning oracles.

Morley's book is that very oracle, Delphically ambiguous. The first chapter focuses on a children's birthday party in honor of a boy named Martin, introducing us to his metaphysically troubled peers and their blithely cynical parents. Jump twenty-one years into the future, when several of those children-turned-adults are now regathered at the original summer-house scene for their own stale antics of adultery and ennui. ("It didn't seem quite square to be in love with a man and his wife simultaneously.") But also present are a child ghost named Bunny and the time-slipped child-in-a man's-body, Martin. Together, the two specters toss a spanner into the calcified adult patterns of behavior.

Morley never chooses a moral victor in his war between youth and experience. Childhood is simultaneously "slavery" and a golden age. Adults know cares and boredom, but also possess a sense of beauty foreign to kids. And over all the angst and laughter, a perfume of pagan romance is diffused.

"Life is a foreign language: all men mispronounce it." But artists like Morley utter its secrets more clearly than most. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2003/cur0309.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*****
'Courage, mes braves!' We've travelled this road before. But if there are any new recruits in the ranks, let me reassure them from the outset that once the title's been tackled (a clumsy Shakespearean reference), we're over the worst of it. Because the rest of this book is a rollicking read from start to finish, dealing as it does with the true story of the kidnap during WWII of the German General Kreipe by a group of Cretan partisans under the leadership of two British commandos, William Stanley Moss, our narrator, and Patrick Leigh-Fermor - widely believed to be the blueprint upon which Ian Fleming based his James Bond character.

ILL MET BY MOONLIGHT is better known as a film in which the young Dirk Bogarde defeats the Wehrmacht with a withering glance that predated Roger Moore's raised eyebrow by twenty years or more. By way of contrast, though, W. Stanley Moss and Paddy Leigh-Fermor are tough as old boots and utterly fearless. But even so, they leave us with the distinct impression that they bring to their particular field of irregular martial endeavour the benefits of a liberal education - which makes a very refreshing change from reading about SAS hooligans, the sum total of whose emotions might be tattooed in their entirety (all eight letters of them!) on the knuckles of each hand. Similarly, there is in MOONLIGHT a sort of bubbly undercurrent which suggests that, though these two young men are at present totally immersed in WWII, this is not what they are really and truly about. What they really want to be doing is getting on with their lives and doing whatever it is that young men want to be doing. (Nowadays they'd be taking a year out and bumming around Oz perhaps.)

There are, be it noted, some absolutely mind-boggling statistics attached to this tale of German deviltry and British derring-do. In the film version one of the characters comes by water, the other by air; whereas in real life the one who comes by air has to make as many as fourteen sorties before encountering weather conditions suitable to a parachute jump. Then, with General Kreipe their prisoner at last, our heroes drive unscathed, albeit at a fair lick, through as many as 37 German checkpoints assisted by just two words of German, authoritatively spoken. (`General Wagen!' is the password that is repeatedly proclaimed thus.) And, with the sounds of battle raging all around them, there is just one killing in the entire story: that of the General's driver, unwisely left to the undisciplined attentions of the partisans - with whom our boys are very far from pleased when they get to hear of it.

General Kreipe's capture may well have saved the man's life. Because his superior officer, General Mueller, was sentenced to death and shot when hostilities ceased. There is, too, a very moving part of the story where the General expresses his regret that his capture bodes ill for his extended family for whom, risen above his station in life, he has been the breadwinner. And there is humour not less than crazy when the BBC World Service boasts about the kidnapping on air, blithely broadcasting the fact that our heroes will presently be leaving the island, which quite naturally results in re-doubled efforts to capture them on the part of their German pursuers - and when, with Moss and Leigh-Fermor, needing just two letters of Morse code with which to signal a British submarine and so effect their escape, they find they know only one of those letters between them, which necessitates their having to hang about on the beach until another party of Allied interlopers just happens to turn up and makes good the deficit.

So in a kind of a way ILL MET BY MOONLIGHT is reminiscent of the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore sketch that begins: `The war's going badly, Carruthers - what we need is a futile gesture!' Yet, in another sense it's much more unsettling. Because a moment's reflection on the contrasting fates of Generals Kreipe and Mueller would tend to suggest that the real purpose of this madcap mission (the hidden agenda, as it were) is not to deprive General Kreipe of his freedom (welcome bonus though this may well have been), but rather is it to goad the Germans into visiting stern reprisals upon the populace which will so alienate the islanders that they will not hesitate to throw themselves with renewed vigour into guerrilla activity in support of the Allied war effort.

`C'est la guerre, mes braves!' And it is only the thought of this highly probable (and horrendous) hidden agenda that prevents me from adding: `Et c'est magnifique!' So permit me instead to praise to high heaven two heroes without parallel and (with the exception of the title) a thoroughly rewarding read. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R23T9QCZV74QFT/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589880668&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bill Keeth]

*Senselessness* (2008)

http://www.amazon.com/Senselessness-Horacio-Castellanos-Moya/dp/0811217078/[Amazon]

*****
The nameless narrator of SENSELESSNESS is engaged to copyedit an 1,100-page manuscript collecting and analyzing the oral eyewitness testimonies to the slaughter, torture, and rape of indigenous peoples of a Central American country (not identified, but surely Guatemala) by governmental forces during a civil war. Midway through his work, he resolves not to try to turn any of the testimonies into a novel, "because nobody in his right mind would be interested in writing or publishing or reading yet another novel about murdered indigenous peoples." Yet that is exactly what Castellanos Moya has done in SENSELESSNESS.

The testimonies, which are scattered throughout this novella, are horrendous and gruesome, repulsive yet riveting. They tell of machete-butcherings of entire families, torture, emasculation, and gang-rape. The narrator becomes haunted and possessed by stray sentences from the testimonies. For example, "The pigs they are eating him, they are picking over his bones"; "There in Izote the brains they were thrown about, smashed with logs they spilled them"; and "I am not complete in the mind". Sadly, those extracts are NOT fictitious. They and others from the novella are from actual testimonies that Castellanos Moya reviewed. Woven into the warp and woof of the novella, they make for extraordinarily powerful fiction.

But what elevates SENSELESSNESS to another plane is that it is not solely an account of horror and mayhem. It also deals with the effort to go on with life as if such barbarity did not, and does not, happen. Outside work on the project, the narrator pursues the life of a hip, cosmopolitan, young professional -- parties, bars, restaurants, and skirt-chasing. Indeed, this almost mindless pursuit of carnal desires takes up as much of the novella as the testimonies and accounts of atrocities. The incongruities between the two give rise to some pungent black humor. Yet another dimension is provided by the "big brother" political atmosphere; the country is still ruled by the military junta that perpetrated the mayhem that is the subject of the report, and the narrator's initial feeling of amorphous uneasiness rapidly develops into full-blown paranoia. (Even so, the novella, at its caustic end, exemplifies the adage that even paranoids have enemies.) "Senselessness" is operative on several different levels, in several different contexts.

The writing consists of lengthy, intricately constructed, even convoluted, sentences. Reportedly, Castellanos Moya's prose has been heavily influenced by that of Thomas Bernhard. While the convoluted writing demands from the reader constant attention, it never becomes impenetrably dense; it certainly was easier for me to read than my several attempts at Bernhard. (By the way, the title to this review is the end of a brilliant two-and-a-half page sentence about the civil registrar of Totonicapan who had refused to hand over his register of local villagers to the army, for which offense he was tortured and ultimately dispatched by a machete blow which cleft his head longitudinally. To quote a little more of the conclusion to the sentence: "* * * I must admit without any bias, the instant that blow fell the restless soul of the civil registrar would start to tell his story, always with the fingerless palms of his hands pressing together the two halves of his head to keep his brains in place, for I am not a total stranger to magical realism.")

Before stumbling upon SENSELESSNESS, I was not familiar with Horacio Castellanos Moya. He was born in Honduras (in 1957), but when he was very young his family moved to El Salvador, where he grew up and which he left, a political exile, at age 22. Since then he has lived in many countries working as an author and journalist. Currently he teaches at the University of Pittsburgh. He was a friend and correspondent of Roberto Bolano, and, based on SENSELESSNESS and what I have read of Bolano, Castellanos Moya is easily of the same rank as a writer of creative, socially and politically engaged fiction. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R6FYSS91A62C7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811217078&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[R.

*****
Two angels are conversing. Apparently, Francis Bacon - the 16th century scientist credited with establishing, among other things, the scientific methodology known as the 'Baconian Method' - made a pact with the devil, which caused humanity to lose their way with God, instead embracing the more vapid realm of technological progress; gadgets, as it were. God is convinced that the covenant between heaven and earth is broken and has charged the angels with retrieving the original stone tablets that contain the Ten Commandments as handed down by God to Moses on the summit of Mount Sinai. To do this, a perfect human must be created - the angels intervene with twentieth century history to ensure that this occurs.

A complicated setup, to be sure. Happily, for at least the first half of the novel, the heavy theological implications of The Discovery of Heaven do not weigh the novel down. Rather, we are invited into the intelligence, artistic and creative world that is the friendship of Onno Quist and Max Delius.

They were conceived on the same day, but are completely different. Onno is hugely intelligent, but suffers from a mind that is too rarefied for the concrete harshness of the world. A savant when it comes to languages, Onno made his name in the world of linguistics by translating Etruscan. 'It was because I made Etruscan comprehensible. The greatest minds in the world had failed - even Professor Massimo Pellegrini in Rome was too stupid - so I thought I may as well do it.' For now, he studies obscure topics and lives comfortable on the interest from his father's inheritance.

Max Delius lost his parents at a very young age during World War II. His mother was a Jew; she met a predictably sad end in a concentration camp. His father was a Dutch officer in the German army, it was his hand that indirectly caused the death of his wife. As a result of this, Max lives his life convinced that at any time, the people that he holds close could leave him. He is an astronomer, spending his free time seducing a string of random women who mean nothing at all.

But when they meet by chance when Onno is hitching a ride home to Amsterdam (a meeting assisted by the unseen hand of an angel), something immediately clicks. From this random encounter comes a friendship that is strong beyond anything they have experienced before. 'Max had never met anyone like Onno, Onno had never met anyone like Max - as a self-proclaimed pair of twins, they did not cease to delight in each other.'

Once this relationship has solidified, a third party enters. Of course, she is a woman, but the novel does not take a predictable turn in having a rivalry for Ada Brons' hand dominate the story. No, she begins as Max's girlfriend and ends as Onno's wife, but the way in which this is handled never for a moment suggests a clash of will, a fight for love. Max is happy that Ada is with the one man in the world he loves without reservation, Onno is gently surprised that he could ever be married at all. Later, in Cuba, under ambiguous circumstances, Ada becomes pregnant - but to Max, or to Onno? It is not clear to them, though the angels make it clear for us.

After decades of work, the angels have maneuvered everything and everyone into place. Max, Onno and Ada were all required to be born to properly create the child who could return the tablets to Heaven, and this has now been accomplished. The first half of the novel is concerned not with this theological problem but with the sweet, endearing friendship between Max and Onno and, to a lesser extent, the bond they share with Ada.

Mulisch is adept at creating a believable adult-male friendship. Max and Onno are both very intelligent, able to bounce ideas and theories of one another on subjects ranging from Kafka to translation and everything in between. A discussion on the noticeable warmth left behind when someone has been sitting on a chair is particularly clever, and funny in its simple truth. While the two men generally discuss matters of history, philosophy, and the spectrum of ideas, there is never a sense that Mulisch is hitting us over the head with his cleverness. Rather, we can believe that we are listening to two intelligent men talking about whatever it is that intelligent people discuss. Unlike, say, a Pynchon or an Eco, conversations do not exist to flaunt the erudition of the author, but rather the character of the characters.

Midway through the novel, pre-arranged tragedy strikes. A very pregnant Ada is involved in a car accident, she falls into a coma from which the likelihood of recovery is slim. But her child is alive and, through the intricacies of modern medicine, is delivered healthy and safe at seven months, by cesarean. Thanks to a complicated narrative device, Max becomes the caretaker of the child, Quentin.

The novel shifts quite dramatically in tone. While Onno embroils himself within the intricacies of Dutch politics, Max raises Quinten, the child which embodies the hopes of the angels, and of God. From a intellectually rambling novel of friendship and adventure, comes a more sedate, measured story of a child's growth and education.

What do we learn of Quinten? He grows up in an old castle, populated with vaguely eccentric characters, each of which is capable of - and willing to - teach him snippets of information which will come to play a large part in his destiny. From one man he learns of Judaism, from another, architecture. He is a curious, sensitive, quiet boy; his stunning good looks inspire trust and warmth in others.

The Discovery of Heaven slows down dramatically as Quinten grows from a baby to a young adult of seventeen. Oddly, large parts of his childhood are glossed over, yet the sensation of a slow novel remains. This is neither to Mulisch's credit or detriment - the novel simply changes pace, a fact which is immediately noticeable from the end of the second part and the beginning of the third.

There is never any doubt that Quinten will achieve his goal - indeed, we are almost led to believe by the angels that the large majority of twentieth century history occurred so that Quinten could be born. This is not meant to be a thriller, though the pages turn with rapidity, due to Mulisch's skill with words and penchant for interesting asides and digressions.

Perhaps the greatest pleasure in The Discovery of Heaven comes from the consistently thought-provoking text. While the last two hundred pages are dominated with theological (both Catholic and Jewish) problems and ideas, there is enough non-theological meat to satisfy any curious reader. Max's interest in astronomy serves as a jumping point for all manner of mini-essays, and Onno's autodidactism is a treat in itself. Any event, any situation, any conversation, gives Mulisch a chance to allow his characters to shine with their insight and intelligence. The narrator, nominally Mulisch himself, is certainly not shy of following whichever intellectual path takes his fancy, though these are nowhere near as involved or involving as the problems the characters themselves raise and discuss.

The Discovery of Heaven is astonishingly ambitious. It tackles a great many themes, and handles all of them with intelligence and candour. Mulisch treats his readers with dignity by explaining every difficult concept in such a way that we feel neither insulted by our lack of knowledge, or that we are in over our heads as character's spout obscure factoids and ideas. While the novel may be too difficult or too long for some, it is unhesitatingly recommended for all others who crave the sort of writing that inspires, that questions, that encourages thought. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPRE2OSZ1GJ1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140239375&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Damian Kelleher]

[[Max_Havelaar]]
*Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company* (1860, 1995)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Max-Havelaar-Auctions-Trading-Classics/dp/0140445161/[Amazon]

*****
By all the Canons and Rubrics of the Modern Novel, Max Havelaar is a disaster. A hodge-podge. A clumsy polemic thinly disguised as an biography of a fictive hero ... until the final veil is cast aside and the 'author' reveals his still-masked face under the pseudonym Multatuli. But Max Havelaar ISN'T a Modern Novel. The rules don't apply. Though it was published in 1860, it's closer to an 18th C novel of 'sensibility', much like Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy or A Sentimental Journey. Is it mere serendipity that the fictional scribe in Max Havelaar, the German student who assembles the notes of the Scarfman into a book purporting to deal with coffe auctions, is named Ludwig Stern? A critic might also trace Multatuli's peculiar narrative mayhem to another pseudonymous author, Stendahl, whose Le Rouge et le Noir and whose autobiographical Life of Henry Brulard are equally spasmodic in structure.

Multatuli in the flesh was Eduard Douwes Dekker, a Dutchman born in 1820 who joined the East Indian Civil Service at age 18, rose steadily in rank during his years of service in Java, and resigned in protest against brutal colonial exploitation in 1856. The character Max Havelaar is indeed Dekker's avatar, but Dekker's career is narrated third hand: by Stern, who edits the manuscripts of Scarfman, who reports on the trials and tribulations of Havelaar. Odd structure? Well, it's even stranger yet, since the literary labors of Stern are commissioned by his coffee merchant host in Amsterdam, Batavus Drystubble, a pompous philistine who interrupts the very book he's commissioned with chapters of his own illiberal blather. And one of Drystubble's interpolations is the full text of a sermon by Reverend Blatherer, a Calvinist assertion of God's implicit favor for the rich and detestation for the hapless shiftless color-stained poor. Drystubble and Blatherer could easily be identified by a contemporary reader as foreshadowings of billionaire David Koch and any of the fundamentalist preachers of the extreme Right in American politics. Greed and self-righteousness have ye always with you!

But if Max Havelaar isn't a proper Modern Novel, perhaps it's a premature post-modernist novel, a collage of realia and fantasy, a deliberate `theater of the absurd' blending sentimental poetry, caricature, factual reportage, and confessional self-psychotherapy.

What it was for its audience -- the citizens of the Dutch Republic at the height of its colonial dominion over many millions of Javanese, Malays, and other peoples of the Indonesian archipelago -- was a shocking exposé of their callous treatment of their non-Dutch subjects. Dekker's purpose was not artistry; it was muckraking, and it had a modicum of impact on Dutch colonial adminstration in the short term. That the book also has enduring literary strengths is somewaht accidental.

Beyond its short term impact on Dutch and other European readers, the works of Multatuli had an extraordinary effect on the subsequent development of Indonesian literature and intellectualism. The novels of Pramoedya Ananta Toer, modern Indonesia's foremost author, are replete with references to Multatuli, and the stylistic peculiarities of Toer's books become less puzzling when one recognizes the enduring influence of Eduard Douwes Dekker. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZF33RLWO8PW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140445161&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Gio]

[[Maqroll]]
*The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll* (2002)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Misadventures-Maqroll-Review-Classics/dp/0940322919/[Amazon]

*****
This book by the great Colombian novelist and poet Alvaro Mutis, and translated by the wonderful Edith Grossman (author of WHY TRANSLATION MATTERS and one of the best translators of Spanish-language literature of our time) is actually a collection of seven novels (the last being in turn a collection of three stories) about the msyterious sailor known as Maqroll el Gaviero (the Lookout). Maqroll has no well-defined point of origin or national identity; he usually travels with either expired papers or with forged papers; he skates close to the law's edge and sometimes goes over the edge; and none of his ventures, whether romantic or business, ever seems to prosper. He views his life and the human beings around him with fatalistic serenity bordering on pessimism, finding solace in reading one or another obscure historical or biograp[hical work about some doomed souls in the European past. He has friends who care about him, some who join his dubious enterprises and some (like the author) who simply bear witness. Some of the novels are in Maqroll's first-person voice; others are narrated by Mutis as Maqroll's friend.

These are slow-paced, ruminative novels -- anyone looking for a thriller should find something else to read. Nonetheless, they are gripping and entertaining, and after you have finished reading them, they stay with you forever. Readers would be best advised to read one novel at a time, and let time pass from novel to novel. Mutis's works remind me of the more serious writings (not the "entertainments") of Graham Greene and the works of Joseph Conrad.

THE SNOW OF THE ADMIRAL, the first novel about Maqroll, is reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS in that the core of the novel is Maqroll's journey up a tropical river in pursuit of a goal that, though superficially clear and well-defined, becomes as mysterious and hopeless as the incidents that happen to him.

ILONA COMES WITH THE RAIN features a woman who is brainy, beautiful, sexually venturesome, occasionally larcenous, a fit match for Maqroll. She almost steals the novel from him (why not, given that she's the title character?), and yet.... This may have been my favorite among the novels collected here.

UN BEL MORIR (A Good or Beautiful Death) is a grim and sad book in which Maqroll yet again is pulled into a venture of questionable morality. Some (including Francisco Goldman, who wrote the introduction to this collection) say that it's the best book in the collection; I disagree, but not because UN BEL MORIR is a bad book -- far from it.

THE TRAMP STEAMER'S LAST PORT OF CALL manages to make a rusty tramp steamer as important a character in the book as Maqroll himself.

AMIRBAR is a tale reminiscent of THE SNOW OF THE ADMIRAL, except that it takes place nearly completely on land, with Maqroll engaging in an attempt to revive an old mine and falling under its spell.

ABDUL BASHUR, DREAMER OF SHIPS introduces us to a character who is mentioned in all the earlier books, Maqroll's closest and most trusted friend, Abdul Bashur, a Levantine who is obsessed with finding the perfect tramp steamer, yet who also is Maqroll's partner in may of his most ethically-questionable ventures.

TRIPTYCH ON SEA AND LAND, as noted, is actually a collection of three shorter pieces, which somehow hold together and have the effect of turning Maqroll in the light like a gem, illuminating some and now other facets of his character and personality.

I repeat: don't try to read these all at one go. Read them in order, but be prepared to read one novel and then lay the book aside for a while, and then return to it. That is the way that I read it, and you won't be disappointed. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RCK0TRJCFXMZS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322919&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[R.

[[Cloud_Chamber]]
*Cloud Chamber* (1977)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Chamber-Myers-Howard/dp/0445032154/[Amazon]

*****
LIKE Tom Reamy, Howard Myers (1930-1971) was a promising writer cut off too soon, member of a bountiful generation just coming of age in the wake of sf's New Wave. Writing sometimes as "Verge Foray," Myers produced a score of short stories (now available as The Creatures of Man) and one posthumously published, long-out-of-print novel, Cloud Chamber. The stories are all marvelous, but the novel is something else altogether.

The reader is immediately plunged, à la van Vogt or Charles Harness, into a recomplicated, gon–zo future. In a cosmos where reincarnation is a given, our hero, Mark Keaflyn, has a date with a woman he's loved for centuries. But her rebirth timing has gotten thrown off, and Keaflyn disappointingly finds her a preadolescent. But he's soon got much more to worry about, as he learns he's been possessed by an evil "contralife" being from the negative universe that interpenetrates ours. This possession—along with a devilish "pleasure-impress" from an enemy—is steadily draining Keaflyn's intelligence and "ego-fields," and he seems doomed—unless he can find his salvation among the "Stabilities": alien artifacts of great mystery.

Tripping across the galaxy like some blithe space-hippie, Keaflyn undergoes spiritual and physical transformations that rival anything in Sheckley for both comic implausibility and surprising pathos. Add time travel to the mix and this Aquarian Odyssey gets weirder than Ian Wallace. I like to think Myers ended up on the same groovy paradise planet that Keaflyn eventually found. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2004/cur0409.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

*The Creator* (1920, 2014)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Creator-Mynona/dp/1939663075/[Amazon]

*****
For several years I have been asking people I know in literary circles to pay more attention to Salomo Friedlaender aka Mynona without much success, but finally Wakefield press and Peter Wortsman have stepped up to begin the task, and have produced _The Creator_, a densely seminal work which like a literary archeopteryx reveals a welcome complexity to studies of European modernism. We can only hope this endeavor opens new narrative lines of continuity not only in Grotesque studies, but within contemporary philosophy, literature, and poetry as well. Here is a writer of fiction, poetry, and literary prose every bit as interesting as Kafka, or Christian Morgenstern for that matter, a praised, and unacknowledged inspiration to both Expressionism and Dadaism, and Surrealism, a writer read by both Karl Kraus and Walter Benjamin, who, along with a prodigious literary output produced a philosophical oeuvre which at once completes and questions its other! Now that Friedlaender's Collected Works have been brought out in German by Hartmut Geerken and Detlef Thiel and this signal piece has been dropped into our laps, I for one can only hope that _Creative Indifference_ will not be far behind! This volume includes as well as the titular novel, one of Mynona's prose Grotesks as well as a contextualizing biographical essay and a much needed bibliography for works in English translation from Herr Thiel.. To think that Wolfgang Kayser didn't even mention this writer is a scandal! Mr. Wortsman's translation is also to be greatly commended as Mynona even by his own accounting was "Ur-radically deep in the German language," ie, difficult to translate.. Mynona's pen name is the word Anonym in reverse, but let's not have him remain anonymous, let's reverse that fate! Mynona! Mynona! Welcome Back!! Thank you Wakefield Press and Peter Wortsman! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGK7N2DI4LIW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939663075&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lanny Quarles]

*****
The House of Writers removes the starved reader from the bland buffet-line that is the contemporary dystopian novel—vehicles that exist primarily for teens to explore their hormones while wearing skintight leggings and sticking it to mom and dad, i.e., the scary adult world—and happily plops her back into the realm of unnerving parables about the smooshing of the human spirit. A country made brain-dead by the false comforts of technology? A society peopled with boors who demonize the dwindling few who strive to create and/or appreciate works of art that challenge and engage a person's heart, brain and soul? If you bristle or scoff at the plausibility of that scenario then please put down your smart phone, pause the never-ending Netflix stream and consult a mirror beneath some sobering lighting.

Economic disaster has turned Scotland into a hellish nation-sized call-center, a pseudo government which maintains control by humoring every idiotic question, opinion and prejudice of a populace that constantly calls-in seeking personal validation for all their idiotic questions, opinions and prejudices. This is clearly not an ideal environment for that rare, thoughtful creature known as the author. So stands The House of Writers, a shoddy towerblock which shelters the few writers remaining in Scotland, and wherein they are farmed out to different floors, each level dedicated to a particular genre, and each genre catered to the tastes of the few wealthy individuals who fund the HoW.

But all of this scene setting really doesn't do justice to the real experience of this novel. The pleasure of The House of Writers is not to be found in its plot (though the book is rife with bite-sized narratives), but in the brio of its confident writing, the black hilarity of its unhinged imagination, the sincerity of its love for books and those sickly few who still love writing and reading them. With a large cast of cartoonish outcasts failing to keep their s*** together by pumping out hack works that mostly no one will ever read, THoW burns through one scathing satirical concept after another, sparing no kind of writer or reader along the way as it rollicks toward the inevitability of dystopian despair; but in the wake of all its imaginings—a star-studded literary convention ending in mass suicide, primates with better tastes in art than humans, the eating and breeding of electric sheep, the takeover of a village with a bazooka fashioned out of toasters, bestsellers boasting pages laced with heroin, an assortment of strange lists, even a few ads from sponsors—the game reader is left with a unique reading experience that is as invigorating as it is affecting. It’s not necessary for what is written about to pass as humane—writing is humane.

"M.J. Nicholls (author of The House of Writers and The Quiddity of Delusion) returns with a novel about readers and writers in outrageous battle with fate and society in Orkney—a battle in which reality, thankfully, is the loser.

Marcus Schott, sacked from serving succour to suckers and loans to losers, leaves the office life to luxuriate in literature. His plan is to read every title featured in Dr. Peter Boxall’s notorious compendium 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. Motoring toward a small pre-purchased cottage on the Orkney Isles, Marcus soon encounters fatal hiccups in his scheme to compress a lifetime’s reading into three years. These hiccups include skittish librarian Isobel Bartmel, self-cauterising critic Raine Upright, and the unpredictable happenings of the characterless Orkney peoples, too long trapped in their bothies of banality, each pushing Marcus further from his ecstatic vision of total list completion.

A light comedy with a sunny paradisiac quality, rich in verbal virtuosity, Rabelaisian lists, and the occasional outburst of cheerful, cathartic violence, The 1002nd Book is the ultimate summer novel against summer novels: an anti-crowdpleaser with a tidy, cinematic plot that should please both crowds and all those thoroughly depressed by them." - https://www.saggingmeniscus.com/catalog/1002/[SMP]

*****
Falstaff, Prince Hal's bawdy mentor and pal in HENRY IV, was one of Shakespeare's more wonderful creations. Sadly, he was killed off at the beginning of the sequel, HENRY V, consumed of an affliction known as Drink in a room above Boar's Head tavern, thus depriving centuries of readers of all that might have been.

Robert Nye resurrects him here. And he does it in a most ambitiously imaginative style. Having drunk from the elixir of life, our hero, at the ripe old age of 81, is every bit the endearingly outrageous blow-hard that Shakespeare created. He laments, "-here I am, an old man in a dry month, having fought in the warm rain with Miranda yesterday, and at the hot gates of Harfleur and Hell with Harry Monmouth and the pride of England, heaving a cutlass, all that - here I am, employing my days in this making of Days, in this long act of recall of my youth and other follies. It is no occupation for a gentleman." For certain it is not. In fact, it's in the Gentlemanly Manners department that he invariably comes up a little slack-eyed. Nye's Falstaff is, in short, a Dirty Old Man.

The novel has a fine beginning, though - Falstaff, dictating to five recruited & variously abused "secretaries," chronicles his origins. He claims to have descended from, amongst other colorful figures, a certain Gurth Fastolf, who fought for King Harold- "the story that he obtained (William the Conqueror's) favour by leading a miscellany of Saxons in the wrong direction - to wit, over a cliff on an escarpment near Dover, at the time of the skirmish at Hastings - is absolutely without foundation. It is, in short, a lie put about by envious neighbours whose talents were never so complex as to catch the eye of William's wife Matilda, a dumpy woman but not beneath my great great great great grand-dad's notice."

One cannot deny that the language throughout this novel is lively and amusing. And Nye seems to have no problem at all keeping up with it. The sideline tangents into various points in history - such as the Black Death and Pope Joan - mesh well with the battles and other momentous historical events, as seen through the eyes of Falstaff, taking place during the respective reigns of Henry IV and his son Hal (Henry V). It is actually in the extraneous chapters, which all said comprise between 1/4 and 1/3 of the book, where I must draw my censure. Throughout this novel, there are so many superfluous and long-winded stretches dedicated to such things as bodily functions, parts of the anatomy, and licentious sexual activity, that I inevitably came to a point where I couldn't read another word of such stuffing without rolling my eyes in profound exasperation, proceeding then to just skim right over it.

However, the chapters detailing Falstaff's part(s) in the battle of Gadshill, his invocation of Clio the muse of history, honor & onions, the number 7, and his own soul were entertaining. The chapters dedicated to anything surrounding the battles of Shrewsbury or Agincourt, as well as the evolution of Falstaff's relationship with Prince Hal, were poignant and bittersweet. Through the course of the novel, the reader develops a warm affection for each of the five "secretaries," too - even Falstaff's malicious stepson, Stephen Scrope. (In fact, Scrope may well be the embodiment of Reader's Revenge for the bulk of the braggart Falstaff's excessive wordage). - http://www.amazon.com/review/R170B40GGF21A7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559705914&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

An erotic, bizarre, and somewhat blasphemous tale about the great court wizard, Merlin. Being half-man and half-devil, Merlin is pulled one way by his "devil-of-a-father" and another way by his own conscious soul. Definitely not for the 17 and under crowd--- however, don't fault that 15-year-old bookworm who is just perusing through the library shelves looking for Camelot books; this book might just break him/her out of their shell. -

"Faust being the
Historia Von D. Johann Fausten dem wietbeschreyen Zauberer und Schwartzkunstler, or History of Dr John 
Faust the notorious Magician and Necromancer, as written by his familiar servant and disciple Christopher wagner, now for the first time Englished from the Low German. Dr John Faust. The man who sold his soul to the Devil. A mythical figure? Not at all. There was a real Faust, historically documented, and every known fact about him plays its part in this novel. But the result is more than a history. Much more. In a Tower halfway up a mountain in the Black Forest, John Faust, a diabolist and drunkard, is expecting a visit from the Devil.It is Ash Wednesday,1540, and Faust has just forty days left before the delivery date on his soul falls due. The Doctor has companions in his Tower. Helen of Troy, of course.Seven lovely young girls, each one with a different erotic speciality. A certain grey friar, Mephistopheles, although only Faust seems to see him.A monkey called Ackercocke.And, last but not least, there is Faust's young disciple, Kit Wagner. It is Wagner who tells us the story of those last forty days, with hardly a pause to draw breath.Slangy, sceptical, rude, Wagner's view of Faust is absolutely modern: 'I'm not telling lies and legends.I'm not trying to compete in the tall story business. I'm talking about a man so real you can smell him through oak doors five inches thick.So let's stick to facts.Believe me, the facts about Faust are stranger by far than the fictions.' One fact seems reasonably certain.Good Friday,1540 - which happens to fall on a Friday the 13th - will be unlucky for some.The devil come. And Faustus must be damned. Or will he? And must he? For this is not a John Faust content to sit lamenting and waiting for the clock to strike twelve for his summons to hell.He has Other Ideas.The Other Ideas take us on a pilgrimage over the Alps, down through Italy where maps aren't much use when two men, eight girls, and a monkey are in hot pursuit of a black dog called Satan who is heading for Rome and the Pope. The tight and exciting plot, packed with twists and turns, marks a new development in Robert Nye's work, and makes this maybe his best book to date (then 1980). A supernatural thriller which is also a very human comedy. Published in 1980, the book coincides with the 500th birthday of the figure who gave rise to the legends first collected in the anonymous German Faust-book of 1587, which inspired Marlowe's The Tragicall History of Dr Faustus (1604), and later treatments of the same theme by Goethe and Thomas Mann." - https://www.fantasticfiction.com/n/robert-nye/faust.htm[Fantastic Fiction]

*****
This book on Shakespeare is a work of fiction, which actually proves to be very appropriate. As Robert Nye states in his book, if even you were to write a story on your life, even that would be a work of fiction, too. Whether intentionally or not, much of our lives are based on half-truths, white lies, out-right lies, misconceptions, misunderstandings, in addition to whole truths and any exaggerations or diminutives of them, all perceived from a single unique viewpoint. On a personal note, I've found this to be true. While growing up, I was presented with one set of facts which I found out on my own later to be not entirely true and that the original set of facts had been given to paint a "prettier picture." It is conceivable that even Shakespeare may have believed some fiction as truth...

Robert Nye has collected in his book many of the rumors, tall tales, stories - be them ugly or pretty, theorizing, etc. down to even the jokes once cracked that have circulated around about Shakespeare and his family from the mouths of his peers, friends and enemies, townspeople, rivals, and anyone else in between. From the very few solid information that we have about the man, this brings to the reader a very interesting perspective. Out of this melange, we can weed for ourselves some of the truth and gain a sense of the nature of Shakespeare. This very extensive collection does make the book very disjointed to read, which is one of the criticisms I have about the book, although due to the nature of collecting all these stories, I don't think the book could have been written any differently. My other criticism, or maybe more a question that I have about the book, is how much of these rumors are true rumors, and not ones that the author may have made up??? I am assuming that all of these second hand recollections are actual since Nye does give a much too lengthy list of acknowledgements right from the start of the book that I felt should have really belonged at the end of the book. This would have given more crediblilty to the stories, instead of boring me to tears with such a long list before the book even rolls off to a start.

One thing I found amusing to read was just as how a few folks among us had believed the King of Rock, Elvis Presley himself, may have supposedly faked his death and is living somewhere in cognito, so did the folks during Shakespeare's times think along similar lines. Some thought that Shakespeare hadn't really died and was living on Iceland instead... We're really not all that different from people of long ago.

Through the musings of his main character, an actor who was in Shakespeare's theater company, Nye also effectively illustrates that when one writes a biography, one cannot help from including one's own life story. It's the author's way of perceiving truth in relation to the author's own life that cannot help from being included in the biography being written. This is an interesting point to consider when reading any biography.

I highly reccommend this book. In addition to all the interesting aspects presented about Shakespeare, I had some laughs and found it enjoyable to read. It is definitely unlike any book I have read. You'll certainly gain an interesting outlook on Shakespeare. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHU3OUZ4VW7GQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140289526[book worm]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Shakespeare-The-Complete-Works/dp/0142000043/[Amazon]

*****
Ah--a clever, clever book, indeed! Robert Nye's "Mrs. Shakespeare" is just that. In this very readable, witty, and enjoyable book, Nye's "central character" (Anne Hathaway) reveals to us the "real" William Shakespeare! Written some seven years after the Bard's death, the book draws heavily upon heretofore "unpublished" comments/thoughts/reactions by his widow. No matter.

Remember, this is fiction. And while we are not comparing Nye's work "to a summer's day," it is magical in its intent. Nye is quite the scholar, although that seems disguised as he flippantly carries us through Anne's memoirs ("the only happily married couple in all my husband's works are called Macbeth"). Of course, as "Shakespearean gospel," there will be the critics and non-believers. Again, no matter. It's fiction. So a little (well, all right, a lot) of leeway should be granted. Regardless of your devotion (or not) to Shakespeare, this take is still a good one to read. That's not to say it isn't intellectually challenging, and perhaps the more you know about Shakespeare, the more you are likely to catch all the allusions tossed--sometimes willy-nilly-at the reader! - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMLIKYXC00WVP/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142000043[Billy J.

*Voyage of the Destiny (2011)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/Voyage-Destiny-Novel-Robert-Nye/dp/1559706465/[Amazon]

*****
"With famed courtier Sir Walter Ralegh as his speaker/writer, author Robert Nye creates a fictional journal which includes all the elements of high drama the reader would expect of this vicarious peek into Ralegh's very private and intriguing world--his climb from obscurity to the highest levels of court life, the nature of his tumultuous relationship with Queen Elizabeth, his career as a soldier, his secret courtship and marriage, his loathing of the venal King James, his thirteen years in the Tower of London on false charges, and his eventual release by King James to search for gold in the New World.

The journal, which begins in 1618, moves back and forth in time, alternating vivid tales of Ralegh's tenuous existence aboard the Destiny, a ship off the coast of Guiana, with his colorful reminiscences of life in Elizabeth's court, when, as a young man he was living the heady life of a courtier. The ebb and flow of the journal creates its own narrative movement and conveys both the vibrant excitement of Ralegh's days as a young man and the melancholy self-reflection which dominates his old age. Sensuous descriptions and self-deprecating wit characterize his revelations about his younger days, while the privation and trauma he experiences at the end of his life elicit both sympathy and admiration as he tries to redeem his pride and reputation while walking a tightrope between his mutinous crew, his duplicitous king, and his Spanish enemies.

Though very exciting and full of fascinating period detail, Nye's novel is more than a biography, however. Ralegh tells us that his journal is ultimately a log of three voyages: first, the voyage of the ship Destiny--his present, day to day life; second, the voyage of his history--his past and his fortunes; and, third, the Voyage of Destiny, not his life or his ship but something more than the present, the past, or both together. This third journey is an internal one, and we observe Ralegh making an effort to achieve deeper understanding, not only of himself, but of the real values which give meaning to man's existence, not the values imposed by society. He is accompanied, on both his real and his symbolic journey, by an Indian named Guayacunda, a mysterious man whose tribe was wiped out a hundred years earlier, and whose ancestral heritage, language, culture, and even real name have vanished completely, leaving him without the ancestral values he thinks would give meaning to his existence. As they share their dreams, they search for an understanding of truth which will give value to their separate realities.

Multi-leveled and totally satisfying, The Voyage of the Destiny uses the fascinating life of Sir Walter Ralegh to illuminate the search of a thoughtful man for truth and meaning in life beyond what society and its values have imposed, not one truth at the expense of others, but truths which come from a life lived with respect and humility, not with pride or a need for recognition. In that way, Ralegh discovers, he may achieve true honor. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MJHESI4FN28S/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1559706465[Mary Whipple]

*Best of Myles* (1999)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Myles-Byrne-Irish-Literature-Series/dp/1564782158/[Amazon]

*****
Flann O'Brian is absolutely one of the greatest practitioners of language. This collection of his work, "The Best Of Myles", is some of the finest writing I have ever had the pleasure to read. Gaelic, English, French, German, and Latin, are 5 languages he writes fluently. He is the personification of all that is famous of Irish Wit. There appear to be few topics he did not comment upon or release a withering appraisal with pinpoint precision.

Mr. O'Brian wrote for a daily newspaper until his death in 1966. The volume and quality of the written material he produced is amazing. This 400-page book is one of five that are available and that I intend to read. There is virtually nothing about his personal history in this volume, so hopefully there is a biography in print documenting the time he spent learning and practicing his craft. The only downside to this book is that some is in Gaelic with no translation, and there are many articles that will seem to exist in isolation if the reader does not have some knowledge of Irish History. Even if these commentaries were removed, the balance of the work would still be a remarkable literary performance.

Some of the best pieces were his comments on the affectation in so many facets of daily life. And his specific attacks on, "bores", and all the pretensions of the world of modern art, and those who would pretend to posses knowledge of which they are bereft. He creates institutes and foundations and companies dedicated to servicing frauds and exposing the truth. Much is for pure fun, but like all humor contains truth. He offers the services of a company that will come to the home of any illiterate with a library, and his people will either rummage through your books for a pittance, or for a more substantial sum, will dog-ear pages, write brilliant marginalia, and leave tickets and programs to various cultural events as though they were misplaced bookmarks. And for those who have the funds, books will receive forged inscriptions from their authors, and letters of thanks to the book's owner for their help with a particularly difficult passage. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7E8RIPB63K/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564782158&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[taking a rest]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
This Dalkey (based apparently in Illinois) reprint of an earlier collection of later near daily columns by Brian O'Nolan for the Irish Times is uneven and most marred by the lack of any notes or most importantly dates.

Apparently the columns in the Irish language only were transposed into English, yet we are left with large passages in Irish, fragments in Latin, and in fact an entire column in Latin and other languages as well. If such a polyglot nature does not alarm you but rather inspires you to translation left entirely on your own, this is the book for you.

Not only do we find this in several tongues, with no support, with no notes, not even biographical of those historical figures mentioned, and purposefully undated, but also arranged by this collection's editor by an artificially imposed scheme of "themes" not original to the author, whose modus operandi involved a greatly varied style from day to day, always a surprise, a large part of the charm. Here we get bogged down in themes, and thus, fatally for humour, near repetitions, especially in the courtroom sequences.

Do not get me wrong. I deeply love Myles, or Flann, or Brian. I urge you to hear the masterful reading by Jim Norton of O'Nolan's immortal masterwork Third Policeman, having read first the text The Third Policeman, or doing a simultaneous reading, to observe how the scholarly references to De Selby are handled, an to follow the conversations with the soul, or guardian angel or whatever it is textually. This clears up several points. This is for me the greatest of Flann, or Brian, or Myles, and a must read in its own right, and like the works of James Joyce himself, had trouble ever getting published in its author's lifetime, but was far less skillfully reworked as The Dalkey Archive which in its very end turns into little more than a shaggy dog love triangle, as if the author late lost the vision and the fire, the train and the hope.

Joyce on the other hand, after despairing of finding publication for Stephen Hero, resurrected it, distilled it, repackaged it, as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.

Perhaps this partially serves as Nolan's own despair, ever walking under the shadow of that giant. We find here upon each page something reminiscent of Mr. Joyce, whether place names, personages, or turns of phrase, and thus we wonder whether this supplies us context for the works of Joyce, or is derivative of those landmark works.

For example we read here a valiant initial attempt, which ultimately falls sadly shallow, at a eulogy for the great Oliver St. John Gogarty, he of Oliver St. John Gogarty (The Irish Writers Series) and so much more, the figure they say for Buck Mulligan and author of Mulligan's poetry. We here hope therefore to read a moving eulogy; the attempt is made,and you judge the result, I cannot. This edition provides no biographical information for Gogarty.

These come from columns written to be read in the Irish Times; hung-over and idly, and here they are served ripped from all and any context, bare naked, without that which gives them full sense, parody and all humour. We do not even have their date of publication to research that context upon our own.

Therefore I reluctantly grant this particular collection a mere three stars for the packaging, a most unfortunate and unfair reason, but the only possible assignation in all honesty. For these columns I strongly suggest you read the excellent collection published complete with notes and dates oddly by this same publisher under the title At War (Lannan Selection). Very little is said of war, but a much richer collection is provided, with indication of date and of context.

This present collection sorely needs annotation, and remains like those nefarious collections of untuned, interred practice tapes never intended for release by our quickly deceased rock giants of the sixties.

Read properly and in context, we realize that Myles, or Flann, or Brian, was our first and original blogger, and remains our funniest, never a bitter old troll, but a skilled and fascinating blogger commenting upon the absurdities of the times, and of our human condition. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY3BTYXCE4SU9/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564782417[Love Thy.Enemy]

*****
Compiled, edited, and with an informative introduction by John Wyse Jackson, At War is an impressive and much appreciated collection of the columns of Brian O'Nolan (1911-1966) which were originally penned for "The Irish Times" during the war years of 1940 to 1945 under the pseudonym of Flann O'Brien. An emphatic, opinionated and sharply resonating discourse that simply does not back off or back down, At War is a stirring account of real problems in troubled times and of one man's determination to speak out and be heard. One of the titles in the outstanding "Lannan Selection Irish Literature Series" from Dalkey Archive press, At War is a welcome and recommended addition to Irish Cultural Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R20M8GC4H3B2BC/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564783286&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Midwest Book Review]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/The-Various-Lives-Keats-Chapman/dp/0312329075/[Amazon]

*****
This is the script of a one man show. The originality is not in the stories themselves that can be found in other writings by Flann O'Brien, but first of all in the language which is systematically colloquial Irish English. Yje, we have the situation that is a cliché about Ireland: It all takes place in the snug of a pub, downing stouts or plains. But this cliché is not gratuitous. It is thrown at the face of the Irish audience to show them how they look to outsiders. They look soused all the time. But it is a cliché that is untenable more than five minutes. And does it concern only the Irish?

Since this is a one man show it is composed of several stories and one is that of a drunkard who stops drinking one day but is put back on the beer road by his own wife and he ends up really badly and the conclusion is the introduction of Jem Casey, the working class poet who will tell you that in life there is nothing but a pint of plain, a poetry of the beginning of the 20th century when street singers were singing songs of that type at street corners. That's how Edith Piaf started. But once again it is derisive, overdone, exaggerated but it is also self-critical and directed at the Irish audience. Funny isn't it? But funny ah ah? Probably not. And does it concern only the Irish?

Some of the stories are very good indeed and the telling of them makes them even more dynamic than they could be in the novels.

We can wonder who the Brother is. Some kind of impersonation of the standard average median normal Irishman. If you can survive that kind of thrashing you get from that Brother, you have some eventual possibility to get back to sanity. Otherwise you are dead, body and soul and you have been swallowed by the Sea Cat. Good riddance. But does it concern only the Irish?

This script is full of real pearls and gems at times, here and there, and I do not want to list them all.

What is more interesting to reflect on is the use and value of derision and even self-derision. This derision is a common rhetorical means used by many. It has often been called black humor and Daniel Defoe is a great master of it. James Joyce has some of it. Yeats does not play on derision. He is too dramatic, even tragical in his vision of the future. Mark Twain is just depicting grotesqueness via exaggeration and it is not even derisive, just entertaining. Derision in this present particular case is directed at the Irish themselves and its aim is curative: let you laugh at yourselves and you may be able to change the clichés about you by being different, by reforming yourselves. The tiger is definitely an animal that cannot cultivate self-pity and tear-shedding pity-begging. But does it concern only the Irish?

Exaggeration then is not there to just make you laugh, or just to make you feel sad, nostalgic about the quaint past that is disappearing so fast we do not even have enough time to see its red rear lights. Exaggeration is there to amplify the message. It is a loudspeaker and a microphone to make sure you can hear and understand the message. It is high time to leave the past of colonization, frustration, humiliation that produced the over-famous starving, alcoholic, poor Irishman who believes his fate is to be a true Gaelic chap in this cultivated poverty, proud violence, even arrogant alcoholism and it is high time to develop the other Irishman, that of the future destiny that is hardly imaginable and definitely invisible in that fate: the destiny to be a champion long-jumper, a real conqueror of fear, riches (and treasure, that of Mael Duin?) and creativity.

Flann O'Brien then goes beyond Mael Duin. Mael Duin at the end of his voyage could only become a monk locked up in his religion and in his total resignation that life is god-given, both bright sides and dark sides, and that suffering is part of human life. Flann O'Brien is not locked up in a narrow religion that closes the sky but his positive message is to be found in the self-derision directed at the absurdity of any belief that considers the future is the same as the present which is the same as the past. Time never stops and then every moment is different and can be better, if we stop being locked up in the Murphy-Kelly syndrome: Murphy kills Kelly but transforms himself into Kelly and he will hand as Kelly for the murder of Murphy who has never been murdered.

The last image of this one-man show is that of a German locked up in ternary patterns and ends up killing himself in a ternary manner leaving a ternary suicide note. This German is anyone in the world who can only feel self-pity for their umbilical cords that were cut off so long ago. It is high time we learn how to walk and live without an umbilical cord, physical, ethical or cultural. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGKFYQ6ROWZW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312329075&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jacques COULARDEAU]

Often a collection of short fiction is the place to start if you wish you wish to begin to discover a writer unfamiliar to you. For example, you could begin to explore Joyce with Dubliners, or Beckett with the Complete Short Prose. Not so in this case. This book is for fans and scholars. If you are not yet a fan, you will be shortly, but please: start with At Swim, Two Birds.

That said, Dalkey Archive has done great service by rescuing these stories. Several of them are so vivid and appealing that I expect that they will now be anthologized for as long as the human race hangs on. I am thinking of “John Duffy’s Brother” and especially “Scenes in a Novel”, which experiments with the device of characters in rebellion against their novel, prefiguring At Swim, Two Birds.

The story that impressed me most was “Drink and Time in Dublin” -- a relentless and unsparing account of going on a bender. My god, but the man tells a lot of the truth. (When I visited the Writer’s Museum in Dublin, I went up to the attendant and said very earnestly that I wished to visit all the places in Dublin associated with the life of Flann O’Brien. The gentleman shook his head at me and said, “You couldn’t possibly, you’d die a’ alcohol poisoning.”)

“Slattery’s Sago Saga”, the forty-one page manuscript of O’Brien’s last unfinished novel -- about a plan to remove all the potatoes from Ireland and replace them with sago -- is a joy and a frolic. If there turns out to be an afterlife, you will find me in the pub of that establishment, begging Flann O’Brien to tell me the rest of the story. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R19USF4NCU9GUB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156478889X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Guttersnipe Das]

*****
An extremely sad story that derisively shows an upside-down world and treats it as if it were the absolute normalcy we should expect. That upside-down world is the Ireland of the Gaelic people who live in the countryside, surviving on spuds and pigs, but also along with the pigs in one corral they call house. The humans live at the end of the house, a shy translation for the bottom or the backside, I mean the arse of the house. They do absolutely nothing, want to do nothing, except boil potatoes for the pigs and the humans and then eat them.

But this novel is in the line of the Irish black humor of Daniel Defoe in a slightly more advanced colonization state of Ireland by the English. Education is to get your skull split in two by the teacher the first and only day you go because you don't even know that all Gaelic people are called "Jams O'Donnell". Ain't them dumb these Gaelic Irish people? The description of that absolutely alienated life is precise and minute. And the black humor of it bites deep in sensitive areas of our brains.

But that life also goes with some dreams.

The dream to have a feast from time to time, a "Gaelic feis".

The dream to go hunting in the next door better area, which means visit the houses there to recuperate objects lagging behind in the absence of their owners, like silverware, food, coins and bills, etc.

The dream to go hunting seals to have oil and food. Unluckily it will end well for one who will stay under the sea in the big cave where the seals are living and bad for two who will come back, without speaking of the alienated one who will have run away before going because of the "work" and "exhaustion" the adventure might mean.

The dream to go and discover a treasure from a dead man, and what dead man, a legend indeed, Mael Duin himself dead in a cave in the Hunger mountain with his treasure around him. And when you use that treasure you are at once accused of having killed someone and you are sent to prison for twenty-nine years. That's how you can finally know your father and come across him in the station where he is brought back after 29 years of jail and you are taken away for 29 years of jail. The last dream you may entertain is to one day come back and come to cross and know your own son in the railway station when you come out of jail and he goes into it in 29 years and for 29 more years and you will become the Old Grey Fellow in your home.

The novel though goes beyond this simple depicting. It has a style, an oral style like some lively oration telling us the story. It is rapping all the time with the repetitions and rhythmic sequences that turn around and conjugates clusters of three, five, nine elements, all diabolical and perverse numbers. The Hard Life is in this rapping music in the text and the acceptation of it is in the binary soft easy-flowing surrounding story telling that goes smooth in-between the numerous bouts of sprinting acceleration. That music is there to charm you and make you dream of what the world is all about: exploit those who accept to be exploited and submit to those who exploit you if you do not have the energy, the desire and the power to resist. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R134VHX5WUX4TL/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564780910[Jacques COULARDEAU]

O`Brien is a pseudonym for the Irish writer Brian O`Nolan, who was also a celebrated newspaper columnist using the name Myles na gCopaleen, the latter name apparently Gaelic. O`Brien`s other masterpiece is At Swim-Two-Birds, which was published in 1939. His "Myles" columns is also well-regarded, and such novels as The Poor Mouth and The Hard Life are well worth reading.

The Third Policeman is quite funny, quite absurd, and, at bottom, very disturbing. The narrator is a very unpleasant man, who announces in the first sentence "Not everybody knows how I killed old Phillip Mathers, smashing his jaw in with my spade;" not only is he a murderer, but a very lazy man who ruins his family farm, and spends his life researching the works of a madman named De Selby, who believes that, among other things, darkness is an hallucination, the result of accretions of black air. The narrator relates his early life briefly, leading up to his association with another unsavory character, John Divney, who parasitically moves in with the narrator and helps squander his inheritance. Divney and the narrator plot to kill their neighbor, Phillip Mathers, to steal his money. After the murder they decide to leave the money for a while until the coast clears: however they distrust each other so much that they never leave each others company. Finally they go to Mathers`s house to fetch the strongbox with his money: then Divney sends the narrator ahead to the house alone, while he stands lookout, and things get very strange!

The narrator meets Phillip Mathers, acquires a sort of soul which he calls "Joe", and sets out looking for three mysterious policemen. The first two are easily found, and the narrator discusses bicycles, boxes, and other unusual subjects with these policemen. Finally they decide to hang him (for bicycle theft, I think), but he is rescued by the league of one-legged men (the narrator himself has but one leg). He returns to Mathers` house where he encounters the third policemen, and eventually is reunited with John Divney.

The above summary, obviously, does not represent the action or interest of the book at all. The book is full of off-the-wall philosophical speculations, some based on the mad works of De Selby, others original to the policeman (the latter including a theory about bicycles and their riders which has to be read to be appreciated, also a mysterious trip to an underground cavern where anything you can imagine can be created). There are a lot of footnotes discussing De Selby and the controversy surrounding his work: these make the book somewhat reminiscent of Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov (also reminiscent in being the first-person narrative of an insane murderer).

Wholly original, blackly funny, brilliantly written. A wonderful book. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NE2TA622P39S/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156478214X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Richard R. Horton]

*****
This novel is a crossroads between Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, James Joyce and a few others who deal with absurdity or the madness of the stream of consciousness of any sane person.

The novel brings together Sweeny, this old Irish character who attacked a priest or monk of some kind and was cursed by him to fly and live in trees; a literature student and his buddy who are competing in creative writing; an author, Delmot Trellis, imagined by these who creates his own characters locked up in the Red Swan Hotel; all the characters, some of them being borrowed from other writers and thus having their own life and career as characters; another author, M. Tracy, the author of some of these borrowed characters; the illegitimate son, Orlick Trellis, of the first author resulting from some rape of one of his own characters, or rather a character brought into the picture by the students. Add to that Jem Casey, a working class poet introduced by the M. Tracy, and a lot of references and side notes from the two students. The whole thing is crazy.

In fact it is fully mad because it is the result of the madness of several people: the mad and absolutely uncontrollable fancy, fantasy and imagination of the two students; the madness of Sweeny; the madness of Orlick Trellis who wants to get his vengeance on his own father; the madness of Pooka Mac Phellimey who is hosting an invisible Good Fairy in his own coat pocket; and a few others.

What comes out of it?

The world is absurd and has always been absurd. All we know about it is nothing but the results of the ranting and raving of mad people, mad like in crazy or mad like in furious. The result is the same: the total absence of sanity, logic, relevance, maturity. Everything is out of joint and it is not even funny at all. It reveals the main illusion on which our supposedly sane life is built. Humanity has never invented anything apart from minus one, zero and plus one, which is already a tremendous achievement in non-entity.

The world has no ethics whatsoever and anything that is supposed to be ethical is nothing but the defecation of unwanted energy, aestho-autogamy, that enables anyone to give birth to any figment of their imagination, and aestho-psycho-eugenics that clean up our stable and defecations of all sorts with ethical and moral principles that are nothing but a fig leave on our own lubricity standing high and hard in our minds. To be born to this world of literature and imagination is to have the "unpleasant sensation embracing blindness, hysteria and a desire to vomit" and the "desire for enteric evacuation."

But the novel goes a lot farther than that. The world is absurd but it is mainly the fault of intellectuals, writers, poets, etc., who decree what is to be believed and accepted as standard truth. The author hence imagines the delirium of two literature students who imagine an author and his characters borrowed from other authors, some traditional, some modern or not too old, some old. They are Gods almighty for these characters and imaginary authors of more characters and they can organize the Trial of the author they have imagined at the core of their imagination by a tribunal whose judges, jurors and witnesses are the very characters created by the author on trial who has been severely manhandled and brutalized by one of the characters.

And just as it began with three different beginnings, it can end with as many endings. The characters deprived of any gratitude can convict and sentence their author to death, which means their own death too, or they can be clement and entrust their author to the probation of one of the characters, which means little, doesn't it? Or the novel can end with the passing with honors of the main student and his being congratulated by his uncle. Note the fact that this young man is taken care of by his uncle is a common trait of Flann O'Brien's novels borrowed from Charles Dickens.

This novel thus is a pure gem of rotting black humor that enjoys soaking in rotting cesspools full of worms, maggots, blood, vomit, feces, and many other rejects and exhausts from the world. It is our consumer's society focusing on learning, knowledge, ethics, beauty, religion and a few other human inventions, reduced to ashes, manure, rotten compost, fermenting liquid natural cow or pig fertilizer, generally known as piss with a lot of acrid ammonium. If you can survive the stench, you may die from the taste and if you survive the taste you will die from the looks of this putrid putrescent putridity and putrefaction. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FKKI715M6QQ0/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156478181X[Jacques Coulardeau]

*****
I first read "The Dalkey Archive" twenty-six years ago, while a graduate student at Trinity College in Dublin. It struck me then, as it strikes me now upon re-reading it (for the second time), as one of the most peculiarly funny books I've ever read. It combines elements of original lunacy and weird science with the resonating touchstones of a uniquely Irish comic sensibility. The story is driven by the madcap schemes of a character named De Selby, who describes himself as "a theologist and a physicist, sciences which embrace many others such as eschatology and astrognosy." De Selby invents a substance which removes all oxygen from the atmosphere (a substance he calls "DMP", the acronym for the Dublin Metropolitan Police) and then discovers that a deoxygenated atmosphere cancels the serial nature of time. The plot moves on from there, with Mick Shaughnessy, a "lowly civil servant", engaging the local constable to help him save the world from De Selby's scheme to deoxygentate the world's atmosphere. In the course of things, "The Dalkey Archive" contains two of the funniest chapters ever written (Chapters 4 and 9): one in which De Selby, Mick Shaughnessy and a drinking companion named Hackett, clad in aqualungs, talk to Saint Augustine (his "Dublin accent was unmistakable") about arcane theological doctrines and the Church Fathers in an underwater cave; the other in which Sergeant Fottrell, the constable, explains to Mick his "Mollycule Theory", the theory that people's personalities become mixed up with those of bicycles through the pounding of man and machine while pedaling down bumpy Irish country roads ("a process of prolonged carnal intercussion"). Along the way, Mick discovers that James Joyce is alive, well and bartending in the small coastal town of Skerries. Need I say more? "The Dalkey Archive" is a work of startling wit and originality, one of my comic favorites! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZ28NE0NQPFF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564781720&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Pat Magee]

*****
The most important prose work in Modern Irish, Máirtín Ó Cadhain's Cré na Cille has never before been published in English. This 1949 novel, as Alan Titley introduces his blunt, bold rendering into our language, carries the flow of chatter "you might hear outside a door when everyone inside is tearing themselves apart; or in a country churchyard in the light of day". The title resists easy equivalence, although "churchyard clay" has long served as as its English echo for critics. Titley, a skilled writer and critic in Irish, prefers the biblical resonance of ashes and soil, for this narrative takes place entirely in a Connemara cemetery, as its interred bicker and boast among themselves.

It was inspired by a report in the author's native West of Ireland where a woman was buried inadvertently atop her rival one day too rainy for the gravediggers to bother with niceties. An onlooker mourned: "Oh holy cow, there's going to be one almighty gabble!" Ó Cadhain set his novel, akin to what Titley calls switching channels between various conversations on a radio, in townlands he knew well in County Galway, near the Atlantic shore among its Irish-speaking community. Then, that language was still connected to those in the nineteenth century who had spoken no other. The author did not hear English until the age of six. Rich in imagery, curt in tone, this dialect of Irish can be difficult for those who encounter it today. Titley prefers a conversational, casual tide of chat, cursing, and reverie to wash over Ó Cadhain's characters. This eases the reader's challenge. The author plunges us immediately into a fictional tale told in dialogue and interruption.

Yet, even if Caítríona Paudeen's new arrival among the dead makes her by default the protagonist, the buried characters surrounding her six feet under crowd her out. Many of her neighbors resent her airs. It is best to let this rattling narrative roll on, rather than resist its banter or weary of its nagging. As a downed French pilot now and then complains in his own native tongue (untranslated): these scolds bore him. He had hoped to find peace in death, but the tomb seems not to be dead at all. Rather, the foreigner, struggling to figure out the meaning of the babble around him, finds it betrays the same old ennui. Sympathizing with his plight, I found myself drifting along as the voices resounded and receded. It's not hard to give way to them as background noise rather than scintillating exchanges.

The liveliest portions open most chapters. The "Trumpet of the Graveyard" summons souls to a reckoning. Ó Cadhain contrasts the joys of the living with the dread of the dead. He also here evokes the intricacy of Irish-language verse by departed bards: "But the flakes of foam on the fringe of a surge of a stream are slurping in towards the shallows of the river where they slobber on the rough sand." The alliteration and end-rhyme give way as they ebb into brutal phrases, and a sudden stop.

Meanwhile, without fresh news to filter into the soil, insults and laments repeat. No effort at organization lasts long; a Rotary Club, an election, a cultural society all flounder. Jonathan Swift's prediction of "a road on every track and English in every shack" threatens the isolation of the village. Its cadaverous inhabitants debate a medieval prophecy attributed to St. Colmcille about the signs of the world's end. This sense of doom deepens in the novel's vague duration during the middle of the Second World War. The corpses debate, as did their real-life counterparts, the comparative merits of the Germans and the British as allies for officially neutral Ireland. The Antichrist's return is rumored.

The talking dead are uncertain if D-Day has occurred. Only with the internment of the newest arrival, Billy the Postman, do the rest learn that none of their graveside crosses are made of Connemara marble. The dead had asserted this, each trying to put down the others, so as to boost their own status. That incident concludes this novel. Its recurring themes of discontent and rivalry dominate whatever moments of tenderness and solidarity remain after village life has given way to common death. In this sobering depiction of a determined counter to the stereotypes of Irish rural relationships, native son Maírtín Ó Cadhain in his native language sought to correct myth with truth. As ably translated by Alan Titley, the results recall Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot and Martin McDonagh's play, both of which feature this same milieu, as they include too the telling phrase of "a skull in Connemara". - http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TG9UOT9RSU9/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300198493&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[John L.

Colin Downer and Lester Dudley Biggins are two lowly undertakers who have been mistakenly allocated a prominent funeral that represents their final opportunity to climb out of the gutter - if only they can transcend their limitations. Throughout the narrative Colin and Lester are dogged by fake-priests, hoodlums, and hot-fingered politicians. They are also iconoclasts, as any authority figure who comes into firing range soon finds out. As expected, the day ends dismally for all concerned. Dark, hilarious, and somewhat obscene, Colin & Lester embodies the Seven Deadly Sins in spades (with slothfulness being to the fore). - https://www.amazon.com/Colin-Lester-Bernard-Michael-OHanlon/dp/1606938444/[Amazon]

*****
After the most recent Forgetting, Ohle's luckless protagonist Moldenke is in possession of only his name and the bare facts of his former life. He finds himself cruising on the Titanic through a bizarre alternate reality where elective deformation is a fashion trend, neuts and human settlers do their best to live together in relative harmony, and the only available sustenance is stomach-churning fare. Everyone agrees the Stinkers are troublesome and something must be done. President Ratt not only fails to control the Stinker problem, but he also has a penchant for decreeing absurd laws and issuing random vouchers of innocence. Violators with valid vouchers defer their punishments to guiltless bystanders--regulations that land Moldenke and his fellows in prison more than once.

Rumours are circulating that another Forgetting is imminent, and that the Forgettings are induced by Ratt's radio broadcasts. The prison guard Montfaucon emerges as Ratt's political rival, and Moldenke, ever the yes-man, finds himself inadvertently involved in a plot to assassinate the president. The rebels hope to return to the Age of Sinatra, "when happiness was not only considered achievable, but hailed as the ideal state of being." - https://www.amazon.com/Age-Sinatra-Soft-Skull-ShortLit/dp/1932360328/[Amazon blurb]

*****
Somewhere between Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities and Cormac McCarthy's darker roads is situated the powerfully bizarre and intriguing Motorman, written by David Ohle. It's not a new work, but it has generated a consistent buzz in terms of the ever popular dystopia-themed literature. It's a short offering that provides only glimpses into an utterly improbable world that's actually quite fathomable when framed from a sense of despairing fabulism. It's concerns the flight of a character named Moldenke away from a series of meaningless activities in Texaco City to a safe-haven away from the omniscience of one ever-present Mr. Bunce. More than his flight though, Motorman is about a vision of a future, or perhaps a dream, in which our conception of time, survival and humanity is greatly accelerated and/or extended. With the appearance of multiple suns and moons (invented or otherwise) along rapidly moving calendars, it is either a cosmic time-shift or mild concussion upon which the reader must decipher and refocus. That, along with the buzzing and fluttering of one's numerous implanted hearts, especially upon an ubiquitous onrush of mindless jellyheads. Ohle doesn't provide many answers, but he does depict fragments of a life under continual decay amid continual surveillance. Ohle writes his chapters briefly, often corresponding between characters as if in the middle of a war, though eerily the setting is oddly quiet throughout. As such, Motorman is a hazy, prescient and disturbing work that bridges our dreams to a fantastic reality. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA9BB4P9EY4GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0970942826[gonzobrarian]

This is an interesting little book, and is reasonably accessible for experimental literature. But despite all the claims regarding the originality of the writing and the narrative style (the book was published first in the early '70s), I thought both style and form of this nature had been developed much earlier -- particularly in early Soviet literature (I'm thinking Kharms and Vvedenev in particular), and in early surrealist literature (I found myself repeatedly comparing this book to Hugo Ball's "Tenderenda the Phantast"). (And of course, lots of the critical literature sees echoes in "Motorman" of Kafka -- which may be true of subject-matter, but seemed less so of technique). Probably "surrealist" is the best adjective to apply to "Motorman". So, to me, Ohle was just using surrealist methods that had already been kicking around for about 50 years. And I didn't find that his application of surrealist technique to the modern condition (i.e., of the '60s and '70s) offered up very much in the way of insight, either about how the world had changed in the intervening 50 years, nor about surrealism itself. The book could have been written decades previously, and would not have been out of place. Rather than finding it shockingly original, therefore, I actually found it almost nostalgic, even antiquated. It's an interesting diversion, a quaint artifact -- but not revolutionary, and not particularly interesting or enlightening in the end. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RI4851MR8WTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0970942826[Reginald Perrin]

The Pisstown Chaos is a novel about disease and forced-relocation. Political power seems to be solely in the hands of one Reverend Herman Hooker, an “American Divine” who revels in the peoples' suffering as they are “shifted” (separated from — and then randomly coupled with — one another) by decree every five years. There are up-shifts, down-shifts, and side-shifts, but no attempt to make harmonious pairings. Chaos rages on as parasitic infestations spread and the Reverend rules with an iron fist from his Templex headquarters, spouting platitudes to the ever-moving masses. - https://www.amazon.com/Pisstown-Chaos-Novel-David-Ohle/dp/0979663679/[Amazon blurb]

*****
"I had difficulty reading the first few pages simply because I didn't catch on that the first person narrator--who is derisively observing his roommate's bathroom routine--is to some degree emotionally destabilized by his own hard life as well as misplaced perceptions. I usually prefer lyrically-written work with sentences that flow beautifully, however, while reading Olesha's Envy, I realize just how much the novels I prefer are the way they are because the writer lives in an environment that enables some hope. As harsh as the environment is, Olesha's novel is peppered throughout with charming phrases which disarm the critical reader: Valya was "lighter than a shadow. The lightest of shadows--the shadow of falling snow--might have envied her" (54).

The novel's Introduction, by Ken Kalfus, is informative. Envy was published in 1927 when some form of satirical protest against the Soviet government was still possible; Lenin had died in 1925 and Stalin had ousted Trotsky, and it wasn't much longer--in about 1934--that it was no longer possible for a writer or journalist to speak and write freely. Olesha's work was suppressed and not re-printed until after Stalin's death in 1956. At only 152 pages, this novel is ideal for high school students wanting something more than routine American literature; honors students can definitely handle comparing the fictional treatment of social conditions. Also college freshman in Comparative Literature or fiction writing can study how a writer's environment conditions the craft of fiction.

To go into more detail, if the world of Envy feels claustrophobic, there are good reasons: Yuri Olesha's narrator, or main character, is responding to a society in which the rich and poor are increasingly polarized. People in control seem to dominate the powerless, and those in control are absolutely stupid and boring people. The conditions Olesha wrote about also indicate that most people have diminishing expectations for the future, and to want change seems futile because change is impossible. (Sorry if this situation sounds familiar in 2006.) To create a novel out of this sort of human dilemma, conditions which were escalating in 1920's Russia, the author had to position himself somewhere between the two poles of rich and poor, of government official and social outcast. To do so, Olesha created the character Nikolai Kavalerov, a sort of slacker or lay-about whose vague or shapeless revolt against his conditions engages the reader's attention. The novelist's craft must give the characters energy so that the plot moves forward to some resolution; to do that, Olesha gives Kavalerov a kind of offensive honesty, a raw self-expression. One-third of the way through the novel, Kavalerov writes a cathartic letter to Comrade Babichev declaring, "Actually, I have just one feeling: hatred. . . . And like all officials, you're a petty tyrant." To understand this eruption as refreshing or humorous, one must read carefully. Read and find out if Kavalerov actually delivers the letter." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDUVR8Y0NHWJS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590170865[T. M. Teale]

"The author of the Philip K. Dick Award finalist Tonguing the Zeitgeist, Olsen blends elements of chaos theory, deconstruction and more into a humorous novel that is part environmental dystopia, part academic farce. Murphy Porter is a tenured professor in the English department of Central Kentucky University. Increasingly cynical about academe, he is starting to find out that there's more truth in the tabloids that he and his wife, Tanya, read compulsively than in his own work on, say, "Bakhtinian Polyphonic Narratology in Gay Bikers from Hell." The government really is planning to send up space stations to house the lucky few in the event of nuclear winter; there may be ETs (someone's talking to Porter's inner consciousness); people are suffering from EI, environmental illness; and animals are mutating?particularly local squirrels, which have become violently aggressive and immune to everything except a blast from a .22. His faith in his institution is further dimmed by the heavy-handed pressure exerted to pass the football team's barely sentient star quarterback. In good po-mo fashion, there's plenty of musing about reality and appearances sandwiched between grocery lists of brand names; of T-shirt and bumper-sticker slogans; of statistics proving what fools we are for destroying the Earth. Olsen treads a fine line, occasionally threatening to become unbearably cool, but he doesn't. Tempered by the tender love between Murphy and Tanya, by a subtly frightening vision of ecological degradation and most of all by true wit, he's instead offered a funny cautionary tale." - https://www.amazon.com/Burnt-Novel-Wordcraft-Speculative-Writing/dp/1877655201/[Amazon]

*****
These days if Oliver Onions is mentioned at all, beyond a snigger at his name, it is usually because of his incomparable ghost story "The Beckoning Fair One" in the aptly titled Widdershins. Yet Onions wrote much more, many of them curiosities, from the wonderfully innocent, yet anally challenging, Draw in Your Stool (odd and moody tales of a more traditional sort) to the harshly alien The Story of Ragged Robyn and the suffocatingly mesmeric The Hand of Kornelius Voyt. But one book that stands menacingly above all these, like a Hodgsonian House of Silence, is The Tower of Oblivion.

It's the story of novelist Derwent Rose as told by his confidant Sir George Coverham. Rose discovers that he is growing younger, not a day at a time, but in occasional unpredictable leaps of years, which happen when he sleeps. Although physically 45 at the start of the novel he has become 35, but with his future memories intact, and he believes he will regress till 16 and then die. Beautifully written in homage to Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, which has a similar atmosphere, Onions grapples with trying to portray a man whose memories of past events intensifies as memories of the present (in real time) fade. Rose tries to recapture lost moments of a past that only exists for him within a present that means nothing. Rose's depiction of his memory as a flickering candle in the dark is a haunting image as is the story's climax as Rose meets his fate striving to the end to resolve the enigmas of his life. Poignant, challenging, breathtaking. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2001/cur0105.htm[Mike Ashley]

*****
Pierre Mac Orlan's 1920 Handbook for the Perfect Adventurer was at once a paean to the adventure story, a tongue-in-cheek guidebook to the genre's real-life practitioners and a grim if unspoken coda to the disasters of World War I. "It must be established as a law that adventure in itself does not exist," Mac Orlan stipulates. "Adventure is in the mind of the one who pursues it, and no sooner is he able to touch it with his finger than it vanishes, to reappear much farther off in another form, at the limits of the imagination." This handbook outlines two classes of adventurer: the active adventurer (sailors, soldiers, criminals) and the passive adventurer (sedentary parasites who draw sustenance from the exploits of the former). Roaming from battlefields to pirate ships to port-town taverns, and offering advice on reading, traveling and eroticism, Mac Orlan's Handbook is ultimately a how-to manual for the imagination, and a formulation of the stark choice all would-be adventurers must face: to live or write.
Generally known as the author of Le Quai des brumes (the basis for Marcel Carné's film of the same name), Pierre Mac Orlan (1882-1970) was a prolific writer of absurdist tales, adventure novels, flagellation erotica and essays, as well as the composer of a trove of songs made famous by the likes of Juliette Gréco. A member of both the Académie Goncourt and the Collège de 'Pataphysique, Mac Orlan was admired by everyone from Raymond Queneau and Boris Vian to André Malraux and Guy Debord. - http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Perfect-Adventurer-Wakefield-Handbooks/dp/1939663008/[Amazon boilerplate]

What can one say about a dead white Italian female writer who is almost unknown to the English speaking world? Well she makes you think and she has composed a book which is not only magical but as profound and philosophical as anything you may care to compare her with e.g. Borges, Poe, Marquez. Yup, she did it better if more complex.

Briefly, in this brief book of fewer than 200 pages, she weaves the fable of an Italian count who looking for investment opportunities lands on a Portugese island where he encounters an iguana, Estrellita, who is the servant of the cruel Guzman family. He falls in love with her - she won't leave the Guzmans' employ and there you have the beginning of this tale. But that is like saying James Joyce is about Stephen Daedalus' day in Dublin or Moby Dick is about a sea captain's obsession with a whale.

This book is as magical and illuminating as Greek mysteries. What is so intriguing is that before the era of chemical stimulation of the imagination (LSD, peyote etc.) Ms. Ortese has concocted a book in 1965 which discusses ideas in such a bewildering array that it challenges the reader on an emotional and intellectual that demands much, some might say too much, from the reader. Yet you might say this of most great works of art, which this most certainly is.

Read it and even if you do not care for it or even understand much of it, you will be well satisfied. I feel that this book will be the inspiration for many doctoral theses in the years to come. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NNPWQA5JMWRG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0914232959&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[propertius]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
Ourednik is to literature what Thelonius Monk was to music -- a stripper of things to their essentials. There are no presidents, treaties, generals, or great leaders in Europeana, just a crazy jumble of anecdotes and subjective historical trends. Every few pages the train of thought stops and begins again in a different year, but everything makes sense and is of a piece. He writes "And the Spaniards danced the flamenco and the gypsies cast dark glances and the Russians were arrogant and the Swedes pragmatic and the Jews devious and the French carefree and the English bigheaded and the Portugese backward," and ends the book with a reference to The End of History by saying: "But lots of people did not know the theory and continued to make history as if nothing had happened."

Ourednik's style allows him to avoid the often dead weight of exposition, character description, and perceptual detail. Instead, the structure of Europeana allows him to provide the meat without the fat and connecting tissue. The book reads so fast, it's hard to slow down enough to appreciate it all and to change gears as fast as the text does. I read the last several pages at a bar, virtually standing and cheering at each paragraph. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTO47ITQ15730/[Jack D. Neefus]

*****
"Man of Smoke," Aldo Palazzeschi's experimental anti-novel, was first published in 1911 as part of the Italian Futurist movement. It is now recognized as one of the most original creations of early twentieth-century fiction. Quite literally a "man of smoke," Perelà appears one day to delight, inspire, and alarm the men and women of the City. His popular rise and disgraceful fall - marked by a series of encounters with every type of modern citizen - make for an often hilarious and sometimes nightmarish social satire. The Man of Smoke becomes the pivotal metaphor around whom the author weaves his tragicomic play between lightness and heaviness. Palazzeschi offers an existential vision of human life that stands besides the best works of Pirandello, Svevo, Calvino, or Musil. - http://www.amazon.com/Man-Smoke-Aldo-Palazzeschi/dp/0934977267/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
*Preface*

"Oskar Panizza wrote "The Council of Love" in the spring of 1893. In spite of the fact that the play was not published in Germany, but rather Zurich, the Bavarian authorities took immediate steps against it and, in 1895, Panizza was condemned to one year of imprisonment. The play is, in the words of Panizza, "A Celestial Tragedy." A modern mystery play, it takes place in Heaven, Hell, and at the Court of Pope Alexander VI in the year 1495, the first recorded date of the outbreak of syphilis in the Western world. The main characters of the play are God, the Virgin Mary, Jesus, the Devil, and the "Woman," Syphilis. The argument of the play is simple: Humanity is out of control: lust and pleasure know no bounds; Heaven becomes alarmed. How is it to maintain its supremacy? God, Who is omnipotent, could of course destroy the world, but then there would be no men, and Heaven needs mankind. Perhaps God should create something new, as He had once done. The difficulty is that God is old and His creative ability virtually exhausted. The Divinity is in such a state of decrepitude that He can barely maintain the normal, daily status of the world. Meanwhile, neither Mary nor Jesus possesses the creative gift. Mary is more human than divine, and Jesus is a dull fanatic, sick and ailing, tired of his role of savior. After viewing the excesses of the Pope's Court, which are shown to us in brilliant detail, the divinities decide that only their old accomplice and victim can do the trick. There must be a "Council of Love," where Satan's advice is sought. Whether "The Council of Love" is really a play about syphilis is open to discussion. The answer, as many believe, is that it is not, but is instead about human freedom and about evil; as such, it prefigured, long before Sartre, the theme of "Nausea." This was the ultimate and occult reason for the persecution of Panizza in his time by a corrupt society that used blasphemy as a pretext and a screen."

*****
"The Pig is the Sun...." So begins Oskar Panizza’s outrageously heretical and massively erudite essay on the pig, originally published in 1900 in his journal Zurich Discussions. Moving from the Rig Veda to the Edda to Ovid, from the story of Tristan and Isolde to Nordic celebrations of Christmas, from Grimms’ fairytales to Swedish folklore to Judeo-Egyptian dietary restrictions, the author contends, through painstakingly philological argumentation, that the miraculous swine occupies a central, celestial position as the life-giving force animating the entire universe, usurping the place of God as the beginning and end of all things. Oskar Panizza (1853–1921) was a German psychiatrist turned avant-garde author. In 1894 he published his notorious play The Love Council: "A Heavenly Tragedy in Five Acts" that depicted the spread of syphilis among humanity in 1492 through a senile god, an idiot Christ, a promiscuous Mary and a depraved Pope Alexander VI. Charged with 93 counts of blasphemy, Panizza found his instantaneous literary fame accompanied by a 12-month prison sentence. Moving to Zurich, he published a journal, Zurich Discussions, the majority of which he wrote himself under a series of pen names. After being expelled from Switzerland, he relocated to Paris until his 1899 publication of anti-Germanic verse led to his finances being seized. He spent the last 16 years of his life in a Bavarian mental institution. - https://www.amazon.com/Pig-Poetic-Mythological-Moral-Historical-Perspective/dp/1939663156/[Amazon blurb]

*****
This is one of my all-time favorite comedies, a satirical look at an academic driven to fake an anthropological field trip and dress up (or, more accurately, down) his preadolescent sons for ersatz photographic documentation. It's also the story of a bumbling parent, an awkward divorcé in search of companionship... all being the same sorry Krippendorf. A mediocre film was made from this hilarious novel, and if you've seen it, please be advised it bears little relation to the wit of this effort, veddy British in its understatement and wry descriptions of the most outrageous ruses into which the protagonist is forced. Humor is a difficult genre to pull off, but Parkin is in command not only of plot ideas that are inherently funny but a wonderfully droll way with words (my favorite Parkin line is from another of his novels: "'I'm sorry,' she added unapologetically." Reading that, I knew EXACTLY how "she" had said it). Unlike some comic writers, Parkin doesn't seem to have any axes to grind or specific classes to assault; he presents only the most generously evenhanded view of the human carnival.

I read this some time ago but noticed in passing the middling reviews for this book. Totally unfair: this is in a class with "Confederacy of Dunces" or anything by Twain or Wodehouse. A perfect jewel. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GVIKD426J2JX/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385332815[Bartolo]

Paris, Daniel Saldaña

[[Among_Strange_Victims]]
*Among Strange Victims* (2016)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
This novel came highly recommended by a friend, a Mexican professor of Spanish, who called Daniel Saldaña París one of the best writers of his generation. So I entered this novel with high expectations. One of the pleasures of Among Strange Victims is how it wrong-foots any such expectations. I could never quite figure out where this book was going, but at the same time, it doesn’t seem perverse or willful in its misdirections. It’s the outpouring of a highly unique and original comic mind, and it seems to have found its own strange and necessary shape.

The novel opens with a series of diaristic entries from a low-level museum “knowledge administrator” Rodrigo, a young and aimless soul whose great projects are exploring the vacant lot next to his tiny apartment and building a collection of tea bags from a dingy café he calls the “café without coffee.” He is a sort of Sartrean existentialist with a sinecure—he likes to masturbate twice on Saturdays, he tells us, and carries a faded scrap of 1980s pornography in his wallet.

When Rodrigo gets engaged early in the novel, it’s mostly the result of a misunderstanding he doesn’t bother to clear up. He seems content to let this office snafu dictate his fate. Soon Rodrigo is sharing his tiny, vacant-lot-adjoining apartment with his wife Cecilia, the museum secretary, in a less than ideal match. Rodrigo’s obsessions do not change until he endures an especially putrid form of home invasion, the discovery of which closes out the first section.

At this point the novel switches gears, and begins to follow Marcelo Valente, a Spanish professor of aesthetics who heads to the Mexican town of Los Girasoles to research the life of Richard Foret, a modernist poet who spent his last hallucinatory days in the town before disappearing. (The move recalls Bolaño, both structurally and thematically, especially “The Part about the Critics” in 2666.)

Saldaña París’s skewering of Valente’s pomposity and romanticism is a total delight. For a while, given the presence of narcos and military security around the bleak housing estate where Valente rents—someone fooled him with pictures on the Internet—you expect that a violent tabloid fate might be in store for him. But here again, Among Strange Victims defies expectations.

It would be wrong to say more, but the plots end up intertwining beautifully, in a totally unexpected endgame that only this novel could produce, visionary and satirical at once. This is funny, lewd, irreverent work— Bolaño himself comes in for ribbing when Rodrigo encounters two young foreign exchange students who enthuse about The Savage Detectives in one of the novel’s several gloomy cantinas. It’s the kind of blow-off tribute B. might appreciate, were he still with us.

“The only open cantina they came across had a more dubious air than the one they had left, although to an inexperienced eye, it might have been the very same cantina, which is exactly what Daga said when they looked inside: ‘It’s the same cantina.’”

A very small sample of what makes Saldaña París special—his sentences. While I can’t speak to accuracy, Christina MacSweeney’s English translation is a thing of great wit, flow, and range. We’re lucky to have it. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R2D5E1IGVGBKYA/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566894301&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Eric Lundgren]

"A generous gathering of parody, British style, in which poems, letters, songs, jesters' joke books, official documents, odd ephemera, and literary detritus of centuries recount the story of an extraordinarily commonplace clan from well before recorded history until the present peak of civilization. Surely no Oxbridge historian could have evolved such a comprehensive Weltanshauung, or Briton's view of things, as is provided by the ubiquitious Dogsbody family. Their story, presented here for the first time, runs like a scarlet flaw through the warp and weft of history, riding high through the descent of English civilization. The Dogsbodys (or their ancestors, the Caniscorpores and Somakunoses, and their cousins, the Corps de Chiens and Hhundekorpers) were there to undermine every great historical event and to inspire each second-rate effort by a Crown's laureate. They were there for the discovery of woad ("I fancy blue men. They are sexier"), for gossip on the fall of Lear (in the style of an ur-Nancy Mitford) or as Clerk of Works for the new campanile at Pisa ("And there should be no trouble in getting it classified as a listed building. . ."). There was a Dogsbody serving as batman to Henry Percy Hotspur (he forgot the sword), playing a supporting role in the fast performance of Macbeth (the author demanded Method acting), and selling fireinsurance company shares to Samuel Pepys (the day before the Great Fire). There were nubile Dogsbodys to muddle the thoughts of Keats and Wordsworth, Dogsbodys to cause the charge of the Light Brigade and to do all manner of unhelpful things. No wonder the family name has come to mean whatever it does. But, it seems, there'll always be an England, no matter how they try. Much of the wit, of course, will be lost on readers who lack a basic knowledge of British history and literature. This sort of delicious japery is founded not on pop "cultural literacy," but on fundamental literate culture. Parody is always tricky stuff. Parrott and W.F.N. Watson, his witty illustrator and contributor, have pulled it off. With a jug of wine and anything else in the wilderness, this book is parody enow." - https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/eo-parrott/the-dogsbody-papers/[Kirkus]

"Elliot Paul was born in Massachusetts in 1891. He fought in the First World War, fighting in France. He resumed his career as a journalist upon his return home, and also started writing books - partly inspired by his time in France. By 1925, he'd moved to the Montparnasse area of Paris. It was a time when the district was swirling with artists, writers and philosophers - Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali and Man Ray all have strong connections with the area. Some of the cafes in the area, like the Select, the Dome and the Rotonde still make a healthy living because of their connections to the artists of the time. Paul himself was a friend of both James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. (His time in Montparnasse was clearly an influence on "The Mysterious Mickey Finn"). Paul eventually returned to the US after the Second World War broke out. He died in 1958.

Homer Evans is a young, handsome American living in the Montparnasse district of 1920s Paris. Although a hugely talented writer and painter, he prefers to take it very easy. (Everything he produces is significantly better than what his friends can manage - so he's stopped producing, as he doesn't want to discourage them. Having said that, he has no trouble supporting himself - although we never find out where his cash comes from). Trouble comes to town in the shape of Hugo Weiss, a hugely rich American businessman. Weiss is a philanthropic art-lover, who has spent the last year funding Hjalmar Jansen, one of Evans' friends. Unfortunately, Weiss has just arrived in town and will discover little in return for his investment. Hjalmar has produced plenty - but has been so unhappy with the results, he has tossed the majority of his work out of the window. Homer, who is also a personal friend of the illustrious Weiss, decides decorate Hjalmar's apartments with paintings borrowed from their circle of friends. He then invites Weiss over, sure that the quantity of artwork on display will win another year's funding.

Unfortunately, Weiss is kidnapped shortly after leaving Jansen's premises. Homer, Hjalmar and their wider circle become the initial suspects. (The police are even more suspicious when they discover Hjalmar has cashed two large cheques written by the missing businessman). Luckily, Homer manages to avoid arrest and sets about finding what's happened to Weiss.

A hugely entertaining, very funny whodunnit - the comparison with Wodehouse certainly fits. I'm a little annoyed I haven't stumbled across Paul's books before now, and I'll definitely be on the lookout for more. Very much recommended." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24DRXV8TH86A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486247511[Craobh Rua]

*****
The Mysterious Mickey Finn is a rollicking, madcap comic mystery that will have you alternately laughing out loud and reading in silent amazement as the plot becomes more and more complex and the actions more extreme and unpredictable. It is impossible to predict what will happen next. As enjoyable today as it was when originally published in 1939, The Mysterious Mickey Finn is a delicious treat for mystery lovers.

Homer Evans is a popular man of leisure, talented at whatever he puts his mind to, but preferring to do as little as possible besides advising his friends. His good friend Jansen, a Norwegian painter of some merit, but few finished canvases is dismayed to discover that Hugo Weiss is in Paris. A year earlier, Weiss had given a thousand dollars to Jansen in order to spend the year in Paris painting. The year has passed, the money is gone, and there is little to show for it. Evans proposes a minor deception to save Jansen, but in the process sets off a freight train of unexpected events. Weiss disappears after a meeting with Jansen and friends, leading to a police dragnet, confused identities, and much more.

The more complicated events become, the more imperative it is for Homer Evans to find Hugo Weiss, get his friends out of trouble, and discover who is behind a complicated scheme of art forgery. There is murder, mistaken identity, disguises, shoot outs, boisterous drinking, and much more.

If you are looking for a vastly entertaining escapist read, you can do no better that The Mysterious Mickey Finn. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUFYDP25DZDH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486247511&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[J. Sasse]

*****
Headlong Hall, an almost 200-year-old satire by Thomas Love Peacock, is the name of the ancestral home of the Headlongs, Welsh gentry of ample means and some intellectual ambition. Squire Headlong has invited a slice of the English beau monde for a country house party. The guests typify popular and competing philosophies of the day: the man who thinks life is a constant process of improvement, his hell-in-a-handbasket opposite, mister status-quo, a minister committed to religious conviction but not action; and a variety of others.

The action is a slapstick device for gently but firmly skewering the fashionable intellectual pretensions of the day, most of which are equally at home in the 21st Century. The landscape architect, a novelty in 1815, can easily be replaced with any zealous enthusiast of today. The only real surprise I found was the comparative youth of the characters; but in a time before antibiotics seriousness came early in life.

The writing is typical of the time and will seem stilted to the modern reader; but if you are comfortable with Jane Austen, you will have no trouble with Mr. Peacock, although I did need a dictionary at hand. As with most satires, it is a pleasantly short confection, only about 80 pages; and the footnotes are a joke unto themselves. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YVBAJBCE2VY5/[eclecticist]

Thomas Love Peacock was good buddies with Percy Bysshe Shelley, perhaps the most wildly melodramatic English poet of all time, and in contention to be considered the first hippie revolutionary ever. An excellent poet, too.

Peacock made friendly fun of Shelley and other doom and gloom types in his most popular novel, NIGHTMARE ABBEY, which is available free from Kindle.

But pay the two dollars and get this Tredition Classics edition. There are italics instead of capitals, and they spell tête-à-tête correctly, all accents included and in italics, without even pausing for breath. The margins are good, the spelling is perfect ... all things that cannot be said of the free editions.

This is, like Peacock's other novels, a mere novella in length, and consists mainly of crazy conversations among lovable crazies like Shelley. Saintsbury called it "caviare to the general," and if that means you won't like it, then don't buy it -- but don't buy THIS edition rather than any of the others, because this one is very much the best.

If, on the other hand, you have a yen for early nineteenth century British eccentric fiction, mixing wit and satire and quitting before the typical eccentric-lover can get bored ... then, again, this Tredition Classics edition is the best, and you should get it fast. It's the only book I've ever read that makes fun of Shelley and still sounds intelligent. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RUZUWD9RUWWK/[James M. Rawley]

*****
A very slow start is enlivened by Peake's droll wit and deft prose, but put your crampons on because the story only starts to bite halfway through. As I could never get a handle on who Pye is when we first meet him - or even whether he's an ordinary mortal - it was hard to care about the strange transformations he has to go through later.

It is quite a page-turner from the midpoint onwards, and I kept thinking, well now, I can't see how he's going to end this but it's going to be interesting. The snag is that I think Peake was probably thinking the same thing. The ending felt rushed and I was left with a kind of "okay then" feeling.

This could just be because I'm not familiar with the context in which it was written. Some spoilers now... Towards the end, Pye is succoured by Tintagieu, with whom he and we have almost no relationship, while the relationship we do care about - with jolly-hockeysticks Miss Dredger - is more or less discarded. One review says that the reason for this is it's a parallel with Jesus and Mary Magdalene. That'd be a shrug from me, then. I don't know or care enough about Christian narrative to get that, nor was I anything but bemused when Mr Pye's idea of doing evil appears to involve drawing runic pentacles around a tethered goat at midnight. Even if that's a euphemism for doing other things to the goat, it's hardly evil - and must have seemed even less so just seven years after the liberation of Auschwitz.

I read this just after Hilary Mantel's Fludd - deliberately, because I felt they might complement each other. The odd thing is (spoilers, remember) that Fludd actually is a supernatural being and we are given almost no clue to that from Ms Mantel, if you don't count her comments in the preface. Mr Pye, on the other hand, seems to be a magician or an angel or an alien right from the git-go, only for us to learn halfway through that he has just been an ordinary man up till that point. Fludd starts well and loses momentum; Mr Pye ambles along until Peake remembers to engage a plot at chapter sixteen. Both are beautifully written but the stories failed to amount to much, and are soon forgotten. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RRKNEKM27TQU4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590207122&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[D.

*****
"Viewing a 3D movie without wearing the special glasses required yields a blurry, migraine inducing image. Razor-sharp focus of plot and theme in Victor Pelevin's genre-busting Omon Ra may not be entirely achievable, and it's a fair bet that the author's Buddhist background led him to deliberately include paradox (a literary koan) in the weaving of this kaleidoscopic tale. A bit of background does, though, sharpen the images that blast through this novel enough to allow the emergence of a rock-you-back-on-your-heels trip to a mental outer space that many readers (including myself) have not yet explored.

Pelevin, Russian-born in 1962, earned a degree in electro-mechanical engineering, then went on to study creative writing. A student of Buddhism, the right-living (reportedly he neither drinks nor smokes) Pelevin was witness in his 20's to the rise of glasnost and perestroika and the ascendance of hope in the emergence of a Russian national culture that would be based on openness and justice. By his early 30's, Pelevin was witnessing the disintegration of Russia into a culture that combined the worst elements of capitalism run amok and gangsterism as a form of government. Two pillars of Pelevin's life, science and Buddhism, are at their hearts a search for purity and truth. Juxtaposing them with the soul-destroying conformity of the receding USSR empire and the insurgent raw materialism of the new Russia didn't result in creative tension, one might guess, but rather a rupture of spiritual/psychological tectonic plates whose 9.0 Richter scale creative shock waves Pelevin (to the reader's benefit) captured in Oman Ra, his first novel.

Oman Ra is science fiction only in the sense that Brave New World is. Sci-fi fans addicted to space opera, technophilia, or alien encounters: stay away. Just as easily categorized as political satire, existential literature, surrealism, or historical fiction, Pelevin packs all these genres into a 154 page vehicle, where they sit cheek by jowl, sometimes uncomfortably. Cram your way into this rover, though, and you're in for a wild ride that rivals Hollywood's best chase scenes. Pelevin's imagery is nothing short of brilliant. From Oman's (the protagonist) father lying drunk on a couch under a reproduction of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, to the use of an unsteerable, virtually blinded bicycle powered moon rover as a metaphor for existence, Pelevin draws sharp intakes of breath and scores mental TKO's from the first pages to the last. From the absurdity of preparing for walking into a lunar vacuum by stuffing lubricated tampons into ones ears and nostrils, to the haunting image of humans as stars that twinkle in empty space, seen by each other, but separated by unbridgeable interstellar distances, Pelevin never lets the reader quite recover equilibrium. The first page is intriguing. The last paragraph of Oman Ra may be the most precise literary expression of existentialism ever written.

Though immersed in the absurdity of life, Pelevin's role as editor of a magazine that deals with issues of science and religion indicates that he may still be looking for answers, still plumbing for meaning. Gertrude Stein once said "There ain't no answer. There ain't going to be any answer. There has never been an answer. THAT's the answer." I suspect that if Pelevin agreed with Stein, his tectonic plates would settle down, and the creative shockwaves would diminish. We, the readers, though, would suffer for it." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REW49Z78RN0R6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099JCQ28[Smith's Rock]

"Just one point to help tuning readers' expectations before starting with this book. The change of name of English version from original Generation P (where P is not always de-abbrevated as Pepsi, but also as more rude word from non-formal Russian meaning the "full disaster"--one could find connotations to this inside the book in the story about five legs dog sleeping in a far-North-country) to Homo Zappiens perfectly reflects common misunderstanding of the subject (actually object) of this book.

Homo Zappiens is just the hopeless future predicted by Pelevin, yet the book itself, as well as all Pelevin's masterpieces from Omon-Rha till Batman-Apollo, is about Russian Generation of 80-th. It is a scrutiny report of how the mindset of this generation evolved (or degraded if you'd prefer) in this period of time. You won't find adequate picture of Russian material world reality in Pelevin's books, but you would see very exact description of how this reality had been reflected in the minds of young people whose miserable destiny was to live (and die) in USSR->Russia in 1980-201x.

Unfortunately for English readers this description is written in the language fully understandable mainly by this generation using cultural archetypes of late soviet - young new-russian time in typically Pelevin's manner: mixed layers of allusions and connotations to cultural images building Generation P systems of coordinates and values. This fact drastically narrows the potential target audience, but for those who are still firm to dive in Pelevin's Universe - good luck and... well, thanks for Your interest to us!" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22ORJD6EOGIHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142001813[Alexander]

[[Buddhas_Little_Finger]]
*Buddha's Little Finger* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141002328/[+https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141002328/+]

*****
"Bottom line, guys - trying to describe this novel is an exercise in futility. For starters, it has at least three titles, "Buddha's Little Finger" in the U.S., "The Clay Machine Gun" in England, and "Chapaev and Void" in the original Russian. God knows what it's called in Chinese or Hebrew. In any case, the book itself doesn't seem to know what it is, so what do you want from me?

Nevertheless, I'm going to take a crack at it. Consider yourself warned.

The central character here is Pyotr Voyd, who appears in two different time periods. He's a patient in a Moscow mental hospital right after the fall of Communism, and he's adjutant to a commander in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. In each time period, he considers his experiences in the other to be a recurring nightmare - in the asylum he thinks he's dreaming about the civil war, and in the Red Army he thinks he's dreaming about the madhouse. He also provides descriptions of three other patients' nightmares for good measure. One patient dreams that he's discussing philosophy with a couple of Russian Mafia types around a campfire, one dreams that he's stumbled into employment with a Japanese firm that doubles as a kind of noble clan, and one dreams that he's a female movie star flying in a fighter plane with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I won't even bother to comment on that last one.

With books like this (if there are any other books like this), it would be easy to suppose that the author just made up the craziest scenarios he could rip out of his subconscious mind and slapped them down on paper. There's a little more to it than that, however.

Let's take Pyotr's adventures in the Red Army to start with. His commanding officer's name is Chapaev, and I'm told that this is an actual historical figure, a real artillery commander and the subject of a biography published in the 1930s that was the basis of an extremely popular movie in the Soviet Union. That film dealt with Chapaev's military career and successes, and his eventual death by drowning in the Ural River as he tried to swim across it and escape from the enemy. For some reason, this gave rise to a long series of jokes that every Russian citizen knows. In these jokes, Chapaev typically interacts with his machine gunner, a woman named Anka, and his adjutant Petka. And guess what? Anka shows up in "Buddha's Little Finger," as does the Ural, though not in the form you might expect. As for Petka, that's a Russian nickname for Pyotr, as in Pytor Voyd, our protagonist. See how it all fits in?

Neither do I, really. This whole novel is so scattered in its structure and approach that it's a little surprising to learn how popular it's become in Russia. I'll tell you what's coherent about it, though; wherever and whenever we find Pyotr and his fellow-patients or fellow-soldiers or whatever, he and they continue to work at discovering the source of their existence and identity. So the plot is completely cockeyed, but the theme is not.

Moving on to the scenes in the mental hospital, it's interesting to notice that Pyotr ends up there at about the time that the Soviet Union breaks apart. A doctor tells him that he's been committed because the ideas in his mind are too unstable, too untamed, and too damn large for his sense of personal security. So he participates in various kinds of therapy intended to calm him down, one of which involves sketching a bust of Plato. Instead of pacifying him, this procedure gets him thinking about what's real - Plato's the one who asserted that the objects we see are imperfect copies of ideal existence. You see a piece of sculpture, for instance, and you know it's a sculpture because in Heaven there exists an ideal of "sculpture" that you know about from having seen it before you were born. For someone whose entire nation has dissolved, this is not a comforting idea.

Nor is it comforting for Pyotr to find himself in love with Anka, since she seems to be in a relationship with someone else. At the same time, whereas Plato says the world is an imperfect copy of some ideal, Chapaev tries to demonstrate to Pyotr that the world doesn't exist at all, an idea he seems to have taken from Buddhism (this is where the little finger and the clay machine gun come in, oddly enough). And then there are the other patients' views of the world, which impinge on Pyotr in some unspecified way.

All of these philosophical foundations call for different responses and actions, of course, and it's a little surprising how adaptable Pyotr is - he doesn't seem to have any trouble fitting in wherever (or whenever) he happens to find himself. And it all sounds utterly stupefying, of course, but "Buddha's Little Finger" even has a fairly reliable plot arc. I won't say too much about it, except that it involves Pyotr repeating his actions of the novel's opening at a different historical period. You can call that what you like; I say it shows Pyotr, after being buffeted around like a feather in the wind, knuckling down and taking some responsibility for himself.

Oh, never mind. That's what I got out of this cockamamie thing - you'll probably get something completely different out of it. The point is that there is something to get from it, and it's a lot of fun to read in the process. If there's anything more available from reading any work of fiction, I don't know about it.

"Derek Pell's writing will drive you insane in a beautiful way. No writer alive is as playful with literary history as is Pell. He literally can retell an entire novel in less than a page. He sees into the madness of literary traditions and reveals the manic comedy that our literary masters were too frightened by and refused to make visible. Pell strip literary tradition of its pretensions and serves us one naked lunch after another and serves us an occasional naked breakfast. I am sure Capote and Burroughs are blushing. This collection includes The Marquis de Sade's Elements of Style, a classic that uncovers the truth of grammatical desires. I now more fully understand the subtle fetishistic desires that even Lady Chatterly did not understand about her own desires for a loafer. Pell completely undoes Anais Nin. I cannot simply call these short works satires.I cannot simply claim that Pell is insanely funny. Perhaps he is insane. Who am I to say? I can say, everyone who reads this book will at some point in the book be offended in some way. You will be delighted as well. "At the back of the S bus, in the rush hour, a lady of about 26, placed..." I must stop here. Abort the quote. Buy the book and read the direct object that comes next.

*****
One overcast weekend in October 1974, Georges Perec set out in quest of the "infraordinary": the humdrum, the non-event, the everyday--"what happens," as he put it, "when nothing happens." His choice of locale was Place Saint-Sulpice, where, ensconced behind first one cafe window, then another, he spent three days recording everything to pass through his field of vision: the people walking by; the buses and driving-school cars caught in their routes; the pigeons moving suddenly en masse; a wedding (and then a funeral) at the church in the center of the square; the signs, symbols and slogans littering everything; and the darkness that finally absorbs it all. In An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris, Perec compiled a melancholic, slightly eerie and oddly touching document in which existence boils down to rhythm, writing turns into time and the line between the empirical and the surreal grows surprisingly thin. - http://www.amazon.com/An-Attempt-Exhausting-Place-Paris/dp/0984115528/[Amazon boilerplate]

"Whatever happened to the French novel? There was the immediate postwar era, when once could read Camus, Sartre's post-"Nausea" novels, the rise of Jean Genet. But in the fifties and sixties, the "nouveau roman" developed, which in the hands of Robbe-Gillet, Sarraute and Butor, sought to deconstruct the possibilities of fictions, and which in the hands of such writers as Robbe-Gillet, Sarraute, and Butor. The result was very complex and subtle and elaborate, with much on the ontological significance of the novel. But it was not the sort of fiction that people liked to read, and it left most English speaking critics very cold. The late Georges Perec was connected to this sort of school, and at least one intelligent English critic has thought that Perec wrote some of the most boring novels of the twentieth century. This book, however, is manifestly not one of them. Indeed it's a remarkable hoot, at times quite funny, and throughout consistently ingenious and clever. What Perec has written is a lipogram, a book which follows a special grammatical rule. In this case there are no "e"s in the entire work. Writing such a book is incredibly difficult, and translating it into another language would appear to be impossible. Fortunately this is not the case, as Gilbert Adair has demonstrably shown. There has been at least one lipogram in English that includes no e, and the unimaginative writer, when he wished to have his characters talk, only used "said." Adair, rather helpfully, prefers to use the present tense. Certain words in French, such as "juif", "mort" and "Amour" have to be replaced with unusual English equivalents.

The result is an incredibly strange novel. At times the sentences are full of proper nouns that exist for no purpose than their e-less nature. At other times the necessary twists and turns are odd and unusual, and the result feels like you are reading a book of palindromes. (Another Perec specialty, and he wrote the longest ever, 5,000 words long). But more often there are brilliant flights of baroque fancy, such as the dinner Augustus Clifford prepares for his unfortunate guests on p. 115. The plot starts with France in chaos, and an insomniac critic Anton Vowl, who goes missing. His friends find strange notes and letters. They find his lipogramatic versions of Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven," Shelley's "Ozymandias," and Vowl's version of the most famous soliliquoy in English ("Living or not Living: that is what I ask). But gradually a plot begins to develop, in a way worthy of "A Manuscript found in Saragossa."

Can Vowl's friends find out who or what is behind the strange deaths and disappearances? Who stabbed an Arab solicitor who smoked a cigar in a zoo, and then absconded with his corpse? What is the secret of the strange ruby-like zahir that brings death to those who mention it? What secret does a carp named Jonah carry within himself? Why does Clifford's son, Douglas Haig, die a horrible death while dressed as the murdered father in Mozart's "Don Giovanni?" Why is one of the chapters missing? There is an especially vicious Albanian brigand who who we learn, long after his death, has been particularly humiliated, along with the lust of his life. But there are important moral lessons as well. The novel agrees with Jefferson and Danton that primogeniture is a really, really bad idea. Also, there are certain perversions that one should never undertake, especially when your brother is trying to dynamite you. And why is the French title of the work the same as the certificates the Vichy regime gave to those inquiring about those deported to Auchwitz, one of those being Perec's mother? There are strange secret baths, the most incredible revelations, the oddest connections between the characters are revealed, and wealthy Ottomans who are turned into peanut butter sundaes. There is deliberate anachronism and the solution is not entirely coherent. But be aware that the villian is not among the characters who in the course of the novel attempt or succeed at murder and manslaughter. As a novel, "A Void" is not at the height of Calvino and Garcia Marquez, who provide love, compassion and hope to their magical games. But this is a better novel than "Pale Fire" and comparable to Borges and Pavic, a Faberge Egg novel in which something nasty ticks." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DGGJ9III55P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0002711192[pnotley]

A foundational classic of Surrealist literature, The Leg of Lamb brings together the arch-Surrealist Benjamin Péret's short prose: a smorgasbord of automatic writing and fantastical narratives employing everything from the cinematic antics of Buster Keaton and slapstick animation to the storytelling devices of detective novels, alchemical operations and mythology. The Leg of Lamb consists of 24 delirious narratives, including the novella-length works "And the Breasts Were Dying" and "There Was a Little Bakeress." Péret's adult fairy tales bear equal allegiance to Lewis Carroll and the Marquis de Sade, and present one of the clearest examples of Surrealist humor, in which the boundaries between character and object blur, and where a coat rack, artichoke or a pile of manure is just as likely as Napoléon, El Cid or Pope Pius VII to take on the role of hero and adventurer. Péret himself edited this collection toward the end of his life. Originally published in French in 1957, almost all of the stories in this collection had been written in the 1920s, half of them even preceding André Breton's Manifesto of Surrealism. The Leg of Lamb offers not only a highpoint of Surrealist automatic writing, but a key chapter in the genesis of the Surrealist movement. - http://www.amazon.com/Leg-Lamb-Its-Life-Works/dp/0984115536/[Amazon boilerplate]

In recent interviews, Ricardo Piglia has stated that The Absent City should have had a greater length. After reading the novel, I find myself agreeing with him. Let's start by saying this is not a novel for any reader. It has complex, difficult literary references, especially of Argentine literature and culture, and I have met more than one reader who has been utterly dissatisfied with the overall plot and structure of the novel. I am not one of those. In the tradition of Macedonio Fernández (to whom this novel is a clear homage) and Witold Gombrowicz, Piglia intends to erase the conventional, traditional lines of the novel. In order to do that, he introduces to the plot a secret machine (the Macedonio machine) that multiplies stories and scenarios that conjure up a surreal (but more than surreal), futuristic (but more than futuristic), detective (but more than detective) novel that I was unable to stop reading. Back to my first statement, I would agree with the author that this should have been a larger work, in the recent tradition -Piglia would probably not agree with this comparison- of Bolaño's Savage Detectives or Cortázar's Hopscotch. I would highly recommend this novel along with Macedonio's The Museum of Eterna's Novel. They would be creating a new world within your own just like in the tradition -and I know Piglia would agree, or at least feel flattered, with this comparison- of Jorge Luis Borges. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JA154NWJ24H7/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822325861&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Oliveira]

*****
This extraordinary book is one that everyone interested in modernist literature should read. The subject is the Civil War in Russia as experienced in the provincial town of Ordinin, in the steppes of Russia, during the year of 1919. The Civil War in Russia was a bloody struggle between the Bolsheviks (Reds), Whites (former tsarist army officers), Blacks (anarchists) and Greens (peasant armies). The town is taken and retaken violently, and the book shows the experiences of individuals from many different social groups, from merchants and nobles to peasants and townspeople.

But that is just the sociological background of the book. The experience of the book itself is something radiant. A sense of nature as profound and always existing outside the passions of men and women punctuates the narrative. The book is divided up into a series of episodes in which different individuals, families, and work or military groups live in Ordinin or surroundings in 1919. The writing is modernist, jumping between points of view and the narrative is not that of a 19th century novel. It is far more exhilarating. You should read it rather than read about it, though.

The translation reads smoothly, although the translator's afterward is not very illuminating. For example, he seems to think that certain characters with the same names are actually the same people. I really don't think that's the case, as part of Pilynak's point is that the Russian people will go on, despite the war. For that reason he has several characters with the same name but with quite different characteristics. In any case, there is also a bibliography of work on Pilnyak. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUVME2GBWC0U/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468306391&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[S.

*****
"In recounting the plot of this marvelous, disturbing novel to my pre-adolescent niece, my sister-in-law from the other room chimed in, saying: "This sounds like the movie 'The Killer Shrews.'" She came in a few minutes later as I was finishing up the story and told us that "The Killer Shrews," a B-movie from the 50s she'd seen on TV as a young girl, had caused her countless nightmares. Like COLD SKIN, the movie was set on an island at the end of the world, and similarly, the island was overrun by malevolent creatures: shrews made huge by exposure to atomic radiation in the movie, reptilian creatures in this novel.

This is one way to read COLD SKIN, as a sci-fi horror story or a fantasy adventure with plenty of action, unexpected reversals, gory battles with perverse outcomes, and male main characters who though dangerously at odds with each other, struggle to make common cause to prevail against alien invaders. This, in fact, is how I told the story to my niece, and it makes for a ripping good yarn. In her words: "This would make a great movie; I can see it all in my mind."

But, equally, COLD SKIN can also be read as a psychological thriller, as an investigation of the human species under stress and the altered mental states generated as an attempt to control an unpredictable and ostensibly savage environment. In this reading author Pinol succeeds as well: trapped in incredible circumstances, the unfolding psychodrama between the two "scientists" on the unnamed Antarctic island is credible, acutely rendered and often surprising.

Also possible is an ontological reading. There is a crucial moment in COLD SKIN when the narrator comes to question his response to and understanding of the creatures who inhabit the island and the surrounding waters, creatures that seem upon reflection not to be mere beasts but to have qualities that he recognizes in himself, e.g., a sense of play, of wonder, and even an understanding of jealousy. In other words, he sees they are more than reptilian brained. He recognizes their "otherness" is no more "other" than the man, Gruner, with whom he shares the island and their last refuge, the lighthouse. The impossibility of truly knowing and entering into another being's consciousness is a recurring problem for all the protagonists.

Further, it can be read as an allegory of the age of exploration when Western conquistadors and settlers armed with Western technologies, conquered and subjugated the worlds they found, classifying the peoples they encountered as savages to justify taking their land and destroying their ways of life.

On the literary side, Frazer's "The Golden Bough" is mentioned in two significant scenes. One of the more famous passages this late-nineteenth century examination of myth and fable seems particularly relevant to COLD SKIN: "The danger, however, is not less real because it is imaginary; imagination acts upon man as really does gravitation, and may kill him as certainly as a dose of prussic acid." (Chapter 21, Tabooed Things). There is a sacrifice in COLD SKIN as per Frazer's system of world myth, as well as an appearance of the ancient cycle of death, fertility and rebirth. In this novel, however, the cycle is more reminiscent of Nieztsche's idea of the Eternal Rerturn where the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur endlessly and infathomably, in the exact same self-similar form. There are also stylistic and thematic allusions to Poe, to Kafka, to H.P. Lovecraft and others

Altogether, COLD SKIN is a stimulating, provocative and unusual work of a fiction that knits together the devices of the gothic, myth and the fable in a headlong adventure story that Mr. Pinol has cunningly crafted to be both compulsively readable and intellectually stimulating." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MBZM6JNFSRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374182396[Panopticonman]

"As a boy, some of my favorite reading was Edgar Rice Burroughs. While my preferred fiction by the author was the John Carter of Mars series, I also thrilled to his Tarzan yarns and his stories of Pellucidar, the secret world at the center of the earth. I also enjoyed H. Rider Haggard. Now in our contemporary era, Albert Sanchez Pinol has taken the literary staple of tales about white men lost in a savage wilderness beyond the reach of civilization and turned the whole genre on its head.

Ostensibly the story of an underground civilization inadvertently discovered by two aristocratic brothers while exploiting the mineral riches of the Congo, Pinol uses this fairly creaky literary device to play several jokes on the reader, similar to the manner of the Argentine writer Jose Luis Borges. The author's choice of plot allows him to evoke a number of literary tropes. In addition to being a a twisted version of a Victorian adventure story, at times the novel reads like straight historical fiction, while in other instances it becomes the oddest sort of domestic comedy (the scenes set in the decidedly strange boarding house where the protagonist lives). At other points it evokes Conrad's Heart of Darkness (the Congo was deliberately chosen as the scene of most of the novel's action for this reason, in my opinion), and also functions as a courtroom drama. What is really outstanding is how Pinol manages to pull all these strands together and still acheives a coherent, dramatically gratifying narrative.

I don't want to go too much into the novel's plot because I don't like to create spoilers, but I will say in conclusion that the author deserves kudos for not only doing a terrific job of research (his evocation of London just before and during WWI is remarkable for its detail and verisimilitude), but more importantly for having the lively imagination to envision such an original and entertaining novel.

This is a book that can be appreciated both by fans of literary metafiction and those who just enjoy a rattling good adventure story." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G2I81TGXUJP0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184767187X[Mark Mellon]

*****
This novel takes place in the distant future, when humans have evolved into god-like beings and rats have evolved into human-like people.The earth is populated largely by sentient and semi-sentient beings who are the result of extensive genetic tinkering by humans. It's made clear that while the "gods" (humans) messed around with the rat's social developement, they evolved their higher sentience on their own.

It's told largely from the viewpoints of three characters. The main one is Rik, the rat. Curious, brilliant, and absolutely fearless about facing all truth, his friend Jak,a Canine, who is impulsive, passionate, and deeply concerned with ethics and what is right and there's Sheen.

Sheen is an amorphous silver being who can assume any shape it wishes. Sheen has no memory of it's origins or it's purpose. It does have an insatiable appitite. It eats egos after seducing it's prey with telepathically sent visions of a sort of paradise tailored to the individual, which they may live in forever on condition they surrender their minds and wills to Sheen.

Sheen becomes obsessed with the gods and with Rik after finding he cannot seduce either. Part of the fun part of reading this was the many exchanges between Rik and Sheen, as well as between Jak and Sheen. Laced throughout with humor and astute observations on the nature of sentient life. Reading about the various other beings who populate this brave new world was pretty entertaining.

There were quite a few sub-plots as well, Sheen seems to be taking over all sentient life (He won't take children or the feeble-minded) and the god's growing unease and awareness of Sheen's presence. There's a lot of cynicism in this book, but it is very compassionate and ultimately presents a strong faith in the innate stregnth and beauty of Life. This is one book I have read repeatedly over the past 30 years, and enjoy as much with my changing understanding and viewpoint of life as I did when I first read it as a teenager. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GVDTH4WPL5E0/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUPQ074&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[J.

"Some enterprising publisher ought to get Doris Piserchia's strange, anarchic little fables from the late '70s/early '80s back in print. In this one, the monster Corradado goes on a rampage in a utopian sky-city, prompting the mayor to hire another monster--an alien entity whose consciousness shuttles back and forth among three bodies--as contract killer(s). The plot follows an orphan boy fixated on killing Corradado and a crooked alcoholic biochemist who couldn't care less about the monster, as they join forces (willingly or not) with the alien hit man. Piserchia's books are subversive in that the monsters are point-of-view characters and we get a kick out of their gleeful rampant destruction of a high-tech but essentially cold-blooded urban environment." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X2VPXHRJ85NO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU2VHDG[Tom Moody]

"A welcome new publishing house on the scene is New Vessel Press whose mission in the literary field is to offer translations of foreign literature into English. Their choice of books is a fascinating one - they have the courage to bring to us in the 21st century some books that have been condemned in the 20th century (the present book COCAINE is an example), while uncovering authors of quality to place before the English reading public.

A bit about the author: Pitigrilli was the pseudonym for Dino Segre (9 May 1893 - 8 May 1975), an Italian writer who made his living as a journalist and novelist. His most noted novel was Cocaïne (1921), published under his pseudonym and placed on the "forbidden books" list by the Catholic Church because of his treatment of drug use and sex. He founded the literary magazine Grandi Firme, which was published in Turin from 1924 to 1938, when it was banned under the newly enacted anti-Semitic Race Laws of the Fascist government. Although baptized as a Catholic, Segre was classified as Jewish at that time. He had worked in the 1930s as an informant for OVRA, the Fascist secret service, but was dismissed in 1939 after being exposed in Paris. His father was Jewish, and Pitigrilli had married a Jewish woman (although they had long lived apart). Pitigrilli had traveled in Europe in the 1930s while maintaining his house in Turin. His efforts beginning in 1938 to change his racial status were not successful, and he was interned as a Jew in 1940, following Italy's entrance into the war as an ally of Germany. He gained release from the internal exile that year, and wrote anonymously in Rome to earn money. After Mussolini's government fell in 1943 and the Germans began to occupy Italy, Pitigrilli fled to Switzerland, where his second wife (a Catholic) and their daughter joined him. They lived there until 1947, then moved to Argentina. Segre and his family returned to Europe in 1958, settling in Paris, from where they occasionally visited Turin.

COCAINE (here translated by Eric Mosbacher) is a wild adventure that approaches the surreal. Set in Paris in the 1920s, our odd hero is Tito Arnaudi who invents lurid scandals and gruesome deaths, and sells these stories to the newspapers. But his own life becomes even more outrageous than his press reports when he acquires three demanding mistresses. To say more would be to deprive the reader of the fascination of uncovering al the subplots and naughty aspects of not only Tito's behavior but also that of the myriad bizarre characters who serve as the props for this Salvador Daliesque adventure. Pitigilli seemed to enjoy stirring the kettle with as much sex and drugs as we are now used to seeing even on television and in movies, but when this book was written the world was a different place and the novel was placed on the forbidden list by the church and the authorities.

It s most appropriate that the new Vessel Press found it fitting to print an Afterword by Alexander Stile who In 1991 published a study of five Italian Jewish families under Fascism. He documents that Pitigrilli acted as an informant for the Fascist secret police OVRA during the 1930s, until 1939. Stille noted that the Fascist secret police used intelligence from these conversations to arrest and prosecute anti-fascist Jewish friends and relatives of Pitigrilli. Stille used many documents and accounts by members of the clandestine anti-fascist movement Giustizia e Liberta` (Justice and Freedom) operating in Turin. An Italian post-war government committee investigating collaborators and OVRA concluded about the writer: "...the last doubt (on Pitigrilli being OVRA informant number 373) could not stand after the unequivocal and categorical testimonies ... about encounters and confidential conversations that took place exclusively with Pitigrilli.

So here at last is an important novel available now in English in an edition that introduces the presence of a publishing house with a fine purpose. And that fact is as refreshing as the reading of this very entertaining novel." - Grady Harp

"Josep Pla’s masterpiece, The Gray Notebook, is one of the most colorful and unusual works in modern literature. In 1918, when Pla was in Barcelona studying law, the Spanish flu broke out, the university shut down, and he went home to his parents in coastal Palafrugell. Aspiring to be a writer, not a lawyer, he resolved to hone his style by keeping a journal. In it he wrote about his family, local characters, visits to cafés; the quips, quarrels, ambitions, and amours of his friends; writers he liked and writers he didn’t; and the long contemplative walks he would take in the countryside under magnificent skies. Returning to Barcelona to complete his studies, Pla kept up his diary, scrutinizing life in the big city with the same unflagging zest and humor.

Pla, one of the great Catalan writers, held on to this youthful journal for close to fifty years, reworking and adding to it, until he finally published The Gray Notebook as both the first volume and the capstone of his collected works. It is a beautiful, entrancing, delightful book—at once a distillation of the spirit of youth and the work of a lifetime." - https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Notebook-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590176715/[Amazon]

*The Foundation Pit* (1930, Russian)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Foundation-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590173058/[Amazon]

*****
Andrey Platonov is a strange Soviet writer who belonged to no literary school and wrote books and stories, some unpublished during his lifetime, that are unclassifiable and unlike anything else I have ever read. The Foundation Pit is perhaps his masterpiece and deals with very real and very terrible things in the Soviet Union of the late 1920s-1930s, including collectivization and the "elimination of the kulaks (`rich peasants') as a class." The title alludes to the digging of the foundation for a building that will serve as a gigantic Proletarian Home--although by the end the pit has served only as a grave. But what is really striking about this novel is the language in which it is written--a language which sometimes seems to be wrestled up from deep within the narrator or the main characters, especially Voshchev, whom we encounter on the first page:

"On the day of the thirtieth anniversary of his private life, Voshchev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his own existence."

Add to this the mashing-up (humorous and/or horrific) of Soviet clichés, and yet other strangenesses of style and device: it's as dense as poetry.

Platonov deserves to be better known, and this edition will help. The Chandlers and Meerson have provided an afterword and notes to help orient the reader and tease out the allusions (from Biblical and liturgical subtexts to Soviet speak). And the translation itself has to be one of the most daring attempts to convey an almost intractable text from one language into another.

NYRB has also published Platonov's Soul: And Other Stories--and these are now the editions of choice. Highly recommended. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ95IQCEPLXSQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590173058&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Penelope V. Burt]

[[Happy_Moscow]]
*Happy Moscow* (1991, 2012)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Moscow-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590175859/[Amazon]

*****
First, let's break down this book into its components. The longest section is HAPPY MOSCOW, a 110-page novella written by Platonov in the 1930s, but published posthumously only in 1991; more on this in a moment. The remaining 150 pages are essentially supportive materials, appendices, and footnotes. There are three essays by the principal translator, Robert Chandler, which are both scholarly and helpful. Then there are two short stories, an essay, and a screenplay, each of which explores similar themes to the novella, uses the same symbols, or features some of the same characters; the longest of them, "The Moscow Violin," is especially interesting in that it recycles almost identical passages, but in a different order and to different effect. The book ends with thirty pages of scholarly notes set in small type, and a bibliography. So rather than being a collection of stories, this is more like a complete kit for understanding the title novella and placing it in historical and scholarly context. While the novella itself is relatively approachable, the volume as a whole is not for the casual reader.

Reading HAPPY MOSCOW itself, I could only think of words beginning with the letter S: symbolic, surrealistic, satirical. None of these terms entirely fits, but in combination they do. Moscow, of course, is the name of the city; it is also the first name of the principal female character, Moscow Ivanova Chestnova. An orphan, brought up in a state children's home, she is sponsored by an idealistic apparatchik to train as a pilot and parachutist, reaching fame and notoriety when her parachute catches fire and she descends on the city like a sparkling firework. Numerous men fall in love with her, and the book follows her as she moves from one to the other, even as her own life symbolically descends from the skies to under the earth, when she becomes a construction worker on the new Moscow metro.

In a helpful stroke early in his introduction, the translator quotes a visitor to Moscow in 1935 complaining that the only maps available of the city portrayed either Moscow's past or its future, but not its present. There were maps from 1924, showing buildings that had since been torn down and roads rerouted. There were maps showing what the city would look like following the Ten Year Reconstruction Plan. But people were so intent on looking at the great leap forward that they had no interest in the temporary state of the city under their feet. Platonov's book is full of a similar idealism. This is most clearly shown by the men who help the heroine. We have the civil servant Bozhko, who uses Esperanto to correspond all over the world, in the hope of recruiting others to Socialist ideals. We have the engineer Sartorius, who is convinced that the problems of collectivization can be solved by the invention of a more perfect balance beam for weighing produce. We have the surgeon Sambikin, who has located the precise site of the soul in the large intestine, and claims to have found the essence of eternal life released in the bodies of the newly dead.

Symbolism, surrealism, satire. Moscow the person is clearly in part a symbol for Moscow the city, but not all her actions are easily translatable. Many of Platonov's descriptions verge on surrealism, but then I suspect that Soviet Russia had more than a little surrealism of its own. And while Platonov's writing seems satirical, Chandler suggests that he may initially have been trying to win the approval of his political masters, whose own propaganda was scarcely less fantastic. In short, this is a unique and often brilliant book, but a perplexing one -- and there is far more here that any but the most serious student could want. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A59VHFOHQ9B/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590175859&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Roger Brunyate]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Gas-Charles-Platt/dp/0861300238/[Amazon]

*****
Very few books are truly worth the adjective `notorious', but Charles Platt's The Gas might just be one of them. Originally written in the late 1960s for an imprint owned by Maurice Girodias - the publisher behind such classics as Tropic of Cancer and Lolita - it would be easy to dismiss it as a work of extreme pornography, and it is this reputation which led to copies of its 1980 reprinting initially being seized in the UK on grounds of obscenity, but there is, I think, something more to it than that. I'm not going to claim that it's in the same ranking as the two works I mentioned above, but the events described are, in places, so extreme as to defy definition as mundane means of arousal.

The plot is flimsy affair involving the escape of the mysterious gas of the title escaping from a secret laboratory somewhere in the south of England. Prevailing winds mean that it contaminates much of the southern half of the UK, sending everyone's sex hormones into overdrive while simultaneously lowering any inhibitions people might have preventing them from acting on their urges, and not surprisingly, civilisation implodes under the effects into orgy of perversion and violence. We witness these events through the eyes of Vincent, a scientist from the laboratory, seeking to escape to the relative safety of Scotland with his family. The scene is thus set for the description of a quite extraordinary gamut of sexualities: from commonplace heterosexual intercourse, through homosexuality, to incest and bestiality; and perversions ranging from coprophilia and cannibalism to ritual murder.

There is no doubting the extremity of the events and scenes described, but Platt lifts his work out of the realm of simplistic debauchery through careful choices of the characters with whom Vincent interacts: a priest, a young female hitchhiker, a science student; and by setting the climactic events of the novel in Cambridge, in and around the university. This enables him to inject a strong element of social satire into the novel, as each character reacts to the gas according to his, or her, type: the hitchhiker with the murderous fury of the oppressed, the scientist with a cold sadism worthy of Dr Mengele, and so forth. Through it all, Vincent just tries to survive, and avoid being dehumanised by the events he witnesses, and the acts he is forced to commit to get himself, and his family, to safety. Whether or not he succeeds is left open at the work's strikingly ambiguous conclusion, which challenges readers to make their own judgement.

Overall, then, The Gas is definitely not for the timid, or easily offended, but nor will it do much for those simply seeking a quick thrill - and a careful reading can be thought provoking. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J3M244X0VF52/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0861300238[T.

"Dystopian referencial sci-fi.

The most hilarious section is a few pages Platt devotes to a vaudevillian spoof on John Norman's humorless and misogynistic Gor series (a Gorean warrior first chains/beats up a woman then detonates a bomb after fighting L.A. street thugs).

*****
"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. It is a blend of slapstick, gallows humor, and literary wit, the likes we haven't seen since Nabokov's Pale Fire, which this book nods to often, with its incorporation of recipes (cold squash soup, sour cream coffee cake), a hysterical acknowledgments page (where the character complains about the Foundation that has provided his grant money but "disassociated" itself from his project) and footnotes.

The plot concerns a desperate historian who moves into the poolhouse of Warren Harding's still-alive ex-mistress in Southern California in hopes of nabbing her trove of love letters. He then gets involved with the woman's daughter, an obese woman who falls immediately in love with him, and pure mayhem ensues, including a disastrous excursion on a yacht that involves the coast guard and a giant canvas diaper. No description can do this hilarious scene justice.

Plunket's comic voice, his riffs on the characters he meets ("I knew right away I wasn't going to like the play. No plot, no jokes, and God knows, no stars. Just eight ugly girls whining about rejection. Well, I'll say this for them--they looked like experts on the subject.") are laugh-out-loud funny, and very un-P.C.

Jonathan Yardley listed this book as one of the top five comic novels in America, and he's right." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRR9B129Z6HTZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060973900[Michael Leone]

*****
"Giuseppe Pontiggia is not a household word in America even decades after this book was first published and he certainly should be. With the popularity of noir mystery novels, this book should rank in the pantheon of mysteries because it is simply that good as a "giallo" book.

The story-line is not all that surprising or unique and considering the number of mysteries published, that is not meant as a disparagement. A nameless university professor's work is maligned in a literary journal in an anonymous article. The professor begins a heated to search to find out the identity of the writer and begins a downward spiral into obsession as he uncovers more about his own life and others whom he thought he knew. The frenetic activity does tend to become almost too much but this helps sustain the satiric elements of the story. At the end of the book finding out the answer to the primal question is secondary to the identities of the other facts in his life which encompass infidelity, suicide, academia's parochialism, and careerism. Remember the statement that Borges made about how mysteries become self-defeating when the solution to them is exposed. Giuseppe Pontiggia does not commit this error.

Which is why it is not really a mystery at all. It is a remarkable satire about the academic world, its pretensions, insignificancies, inbreeding, favoritism, vanity and almost a total disconnect with the "real" world. The constant references to a chess game point us what the author is really writing about, "the invisible player."

Aside from the leitmotif of chess, the novel abounds with allusions to the classical world, Latin and Greek, literary journals, contrapposed with modern day concerns such a money, love, sex, self-esteem and even furniture.

The reader will become enthralled with this complex psychological "mystery" and will discover that at the end of it, he will want to read it again and again." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21I3WOMWOF3G5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941419150[+https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21I3WOMWOF3G5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941419150+]

*****
A G Porta weaves a profound study of consciousness, being, identity, and obsession. The screenwriter writes about the girl. and the girl writes about the screenwriter. Life is a mutual fiction. Fantasy is reality, and reality is fantasy. Personal identity is obscured as all characters, literary figures and cities are referred to anonymously by their descriptor - `the screenwriter', `the girl', `the neighbouring country's capital', `the author that revolutionised twentieth-century literature' etc. Joyce, Kafka, Shakespeare, Schoenberg, Wittgenstein, Proust and Cervantes all get treated thus. We are our epithet or our action, not our selves.

Human consciousness is a confusing mesmerising repetitive circle, `the weariness of performing the same rituals every day, thinking the same thoughts every day, repeating the same day every day, or seeming to' (p252). Porta's paradigm is that `through the cumulative effect of describing many small and seemingly insignificant events, the author creates a magnificent crumbling mosaic of a world in crisis' (p256). Sex is the prevailing neurotic obsession, predominantly for the screenwriter, but also for the musicians, the girl, her mother, her father. Social censure, ostracism and murder are the systematised reactions. Porta follows Wittgenstein and makes us wonder whether our consciousness is objective, or a Jungian common mental state bequeathed by a single source. He ponders both but leaves us hanging.

Readers wanting a linear story will be frustrated, but those with a readiness to patiently enter and dwell on Porta's portrayal of human consciousness will find his novel absorbing and moving. And yes, there is a climax! - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B2MWWZFPDRH0/[Geoff Crocker]

*****
Joyce Porter served in the Royal Air Force for 14 years. Later in life she enjoyed the travel that accompanied her international acclaim as a writer. It was therefore fitting that when she passed away in 1990 it was aboard an airplane, not in a crash but of a virus she had contracted on a visit to China.

Porter's great gift to her literary fans was Scotland Yard's "least wanted man", Detective Chief Inspector Wilfred Dover, who, from 1964 to 1985, in ten novels and eleven short stories, embarrassed his superiors, mortified his assistant, shocked local constabularies, and terrorized everyone associated with his murder investigations, the innocent quite as well as the guilty.

Dover was Oliver Hardy gone curdled: obese, obnoxious, cheap, lazy, incompetent, unhygienic, and omnivorous. With his pestilent bowler hat, his shabby, wrinkled black suit, his muddy, smelly boots, his fetid breath, and his Fuhrer mustache, he approached every case with the single-minded aim of getting it off the books as quickly as possible with the least inconvenience to himself. In his view, everyone was a culprit who deserved a browbeating until someone had sense enough to confess. If he had his druthers - which he stated plainly unless lying served him better, or pitiful whining, craven pleading, heartfelt complaints and brutal threats went unavailing - he would simply have locked every suspect - man, woman or child - in a small room and thumped them with a rubber truncheon until the truth was out.

Unfortunately for Dover that technique was frowned upon by the great British public, who insisted on rather annoying standards of humane behavior toward their criminal class that Dover found to be nothing but a nuisance to his methods and an impediment to his goal, that of retirement with full pension.

Dover's excesses were curbed only by his long-suffering assistant, the prim, proper, courteous, educated, and elegant Detective Sergeant MacGregor. It was bad enough for MacGregor that his association with Dover stymied his professional ambition. His indignities were compounded by the tendency of the Yard to dispatch Dover to homicides well off the well-trod path in dreary localities whose principal features were inclement weather and acute shortage of amenities. One might almost suspect that Dover's masters quite relished his prolonged absences from the office. For his part, Dover bitterly resented his energetic assistant's diplomacy, observance of legal niceties, and evidence-gathering efforts. He cast a jaundiced eye on MacGregor, who cherished the quaint notion that justice should be the outcome of criminal investigations while Dover's unshaken certainty was that arrests and, when the overly sympathetic courts would allow, convictions were the entire point. Dover reckoned that whether or not the accused was actually guilty was none of his business.

Joyce Porter was raised in a northern English village typical of the setting where most of the Dover whodunits unfold. Her keen ear for idiomatic speech and her sharply affectionate recollections of small town eccentrics enliven the caricatures that populate her stories. Her humor shines not merely in the preposterous Dover and his surly manners, but in the finely wrought prejudices and predilections of the minor characters.

The volume under review is the first collection of the Dover short stories. The reader need not fear that Dover in miniature is any less gratifying than in the novels. Even in small doses, Dover is churlish, abusive, outrageous, unsavory, and delightful. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7ZY9RS6ZVQ1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881503428&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Phil Wernig]

FAIR WARNING: read "Norwood," and Norwood Pratt of Ralph, Texas,and his whole wonderful, bizarre entourage will live in your head forever. You'll be at a holiday dinner table sometime and your know-it-all brother-in-law will be expounding ponderously on something he read in "Reader's Digest," and you'll find yourself wondering if he does his research in the bathroom like Bill Bird, who married Norwood's sister and whose scholarship came from the Grit news sheet and "Sunset." Or for no discernible reason, you'll find yourself thinking of Joanne the Educated Chicken and you'll try to recall exactly how her owners rigged that mortarboard so it stayed put in the penny arcade from which Norwood rescued her. Trailways busses will never again seem dull conveyances. You'll give copies of the book to all your friends so you will never be without someone with whom to share the pure pleasure of this most American of picaresque novels.

The picaresque novel originated in Spain and Germany, where the protagonist is a rogue who sallies forth on a series of episodic adventures, surviving scrapes by his wits and deviousness and ending up something of a reformed citizen in the end. When English novelists got hold of the genre, they felt no particular need to redeem their protagonists---witness "Moll Flanders," "Tom Jones," and Tobias Smollett's sundry rogues. In American hands, the hero acquired actual virtue, though he is usually a person of low social status or deep innocence/ignorance who survives by his wits in a sophisticated and often corrupt society. Think of "Huck Finn" and Faulkner's "The Reivers," for instance. Think "innocent eye" and noble savage.

Actually Norwood and his sister Vernell don't live exactly in Ralph, but just the other side of Ralph. Their alcoholic father is a shade tree mechanic who "had always enjoyed living on the edge of places or between places, even when he had a choice. [so] they had moved a lot, back and forth along U.S. Highway 82 in the oil fields [Mr. Pratt] did not prefer one side over the other."

Norwood himself is a good boy and a good son, and when they moved to Ralph, he drops out of school and goes to work at a Nipper service station and uses the first money he makes to add a bathroom onto the house for his mother In it he installs "a bathtub new from Sears, and it WAS a delight. It was low and modern and sleek, with a built-in thing for the soap. There was a raised wave design on the bottom. Mrs. Pratt was well pleased and said so."

Yet Norwood also has ambitions, dreams. He wants to see the world. He joins the marines with those in mind, but when his father dies, he has to come home to take care of Vernell, who is overburdened neither with wit nor energy. Stuck again at the Nipper station, our hero dreams of The Louisiana Hayride, where folks like Hank Williams and Elvis Presley had gotten their start on the way to Nashville and the world beyond. He is saving toward that end. So when Grady Fring the Kredit King offers him a chance to deliver a car to New York City, Norwood, radiant at the prospects of "speeding across the country in a late model car, seeing all the sights" and at the same time retrieving the $70 owed him by another marine, asks no questions. Like so many Americans and characters in American novels, Norwood hits the highways with high hopes.

That those hopes don't work out precisely as he had imagined is no matter, and, in fact, suggests the power of our most prized virtues to take us places we could never have envisioned. Like Huck, Norwood is ever optimistic and honorable. His democratic eye sees the nobility in the world's second-smallest and most perfect small fat man. And the same decency that leads him to take in con artists also leads him to free Joanne the Educated Chicken, mortar board and all, from her steamy pen at a penny arcade. He is an American Everyman, and we are blessed to to travel with him.

I note that one reviewer first read this book at age ten. How I envy him! To have had all those years enriched with the best laughter I can imagine.

Jacques Barzun once said that he would give every American high school graduate a copy of Thoreau's "Walden." I would give them "Norwood" and "Dog of the South." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36LOQM6AL6D8H/[gi]

*****
Trying to describe Charles Portis' classic novel The Dog of the South is not easy, since this book doesn't fit nicely into any category I've encountered before. The book is sort of a cross between Confederacy of Dunces, and maybe a more accessible (and enjoyable) Pynchon. The narrator, Ray Midge, is a 28 year old fussbudget from Arkansas who has trouble settling down to a real job, and whose wife Norma has recently left him for her first husband, Guy Dupree, a hapless radical arrested for threatening the President. Midge wouldn't be THAT mad except the lovers on the lam took Ray's Ford Torino, and left him Guy's [run down] Buick filled with Heath wrappers, and reeking of dog.

This relatively sparse outline of a plot sets a wonderful story in motion, as Midge follows the trail of his wife's credit card receipts to follow them to Central America, ostensibly to get his car back. Along the way Midge meets a zany ex-doctor, named Symes, a loony Louisiana character who seems to me right off the pages of John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece Confederacy of Dunces.

It is difficult to explain the plot and the characters, it is simply a parade of oddball characters and circumstances. Ray looks out the window at some pelicans, and one gets hit by lightning. He makes polite conversation to a kid, asking him "How many states have you seen?" and the kid inexplicably snarls back "More than you!" Every meeting and social interaction takes a somewhat unexpected, but strangely believable turn so there was something to enjoy and chuckle about on every page.

The novel is also full of wry observations and bits of wisdom, like when the narrator warns readers to turn glasses or mugs with handles to the left, as if you were left-handed, since the side of the cup you are sipping has come into contact with fewer human mouths. Portis' outlook is offbeat to be sure, but there's a zany truth to much of it.

This was my first encounter with Portis' work, much of which is in the process of being re-released (the book was written in the mid 70's), and if Dog of the South is any example Portis is a writer who begs to be rediscovered by modern readers looking for a comedic road trip story. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJFDPYJ8IA61/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585679313&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[J.

Potocki, Jan (1761-1815)

*The Manuscript Found in Saragossa* (~1800, 1996)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140445803/[Amazon]

*****
Jan Potocki (1761 - 1815) lived a life that reads more like fiction than fact. A Polish nobleman, army officer, novice Knight of Malta, ethnologist, linguist, early balloonist, and world traveler, he is without question one of the most intriguing figures of his age. Yet there is more to Potocki, including some rather dark rumors too.

Potocki had a keen interest in the occult and was an acquaintance of Alessandro Cagliostro (into whose elaborate Egyptian-styled Masonry he may have been initiated). Potocki's two marriages ended in accusations of incest. Thereafter, Potocki retreated to his estate where he is said to have committed suicide with a silver bullet he fashioned from a sugar bowl handle - a gift from his mother - which he had blessed by his priest.

Potocki wrote several travelogues documenting his adventures. He also left a novel, originally written in French, titled The Manuscript Found in Saragossa (1814). A literary nesting doll, the book is a collection of interwoven stories adopting a variety styles and conceits. The "manuscript" is said to have been found by a French military officer who, following his capture, is presented with a translated copy of the work.

Superficially, it is the diary and recollections of a young army captain in the Walloon Guards who has been called to Madrid for a new posting. While en route, this Alphonse van Worden is separated from his companions and forced to take refuge in an abandoned hostelry. Here he meets two beautiful Muslim princesses who may, or may not be, the ghosts of two recently hung bandits, the Zoto brothers. Bound by his strict code of honor, if not chastity, the young soldier's word is repeatedly tried and tested as he encounters the Inquisition, a religious hermit, bandits, cabalists, gypsies, a mathematician, the "Wandering Jew," and a mysterious Muslim sheik that controls the lonely Spanish countryside where the story takes place.

The Manuscript Found in Saragossa is a delicious rabbit hole down which the Masonic reader will, at times, feel he is witnessing a series of obscure Ecosais degrees. Its 66 stories are by turn humorous, picaresque, erotic, gothic, and esoteric. Many incidents and characters call to mind the cards from the Tarot's Major Arcana. Even the protagonist, Van Worden, is left to wonder whether he hasn't been caught up in a vast conspiracy, the substance of which is always just beyond his grasp:

...I recognized the ill-starred gallows of Zoto's brothers. The sight of this made me curious. I hastened down and indeed came to the foot of the gallows from which the two hanged men were suspended.
I looked away and sadly climbed back to camp. The gypsy chief asked me where I had been. I replied that I had been down to the gallows of Zoto's two brothers.
`Where are they,' asked the gypsy.
`What do you mean,' I replied. `Are they in the habit of absenting themselves?'
`Often,' said the gypsy, `especially at night.'

These few words made me very pensive. I found myself once again in the neighborhood of those damned ghosts and whether or not they were vampires or had been used to persecute me, I believed that I had much to fear from them. I was morose for the rest of the day, did not eat supper and went to bed, where I dreamed of vampires, phantoms, nightmares, spectres and hanged men.
Potocki's Manuscript is meant to entertain rather than illuminate.

It deservedly draws comparisons with The Arabian Nights, Canterbury Tales, and Decameron. Whether The Manuscript constitutes "Masonic" literature, on the other hand, is up to the reader to decide. But be forewarned, there will be as many twists and turns to reach that conclusion as there are in the book itself. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G1Q5SUR8QAFB/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140445803[Mitchell Ozog]

""I know of no other animals who are more consistently curious, more willing to explore new experiences, more ready to meet the world with open mouthed enthusiasm. Pigs, I have discovered, are incurable optimists and get a big kick out of just being."
- Lyall Watson, 'The Whole Hog'

'Pyg' tells the tale of Toby, a pig whose feats of learning and intelligence astound such 18th Century luminaries as Samuel Johnson, Anna Seward, William Blake and Robert Burns. A boy named Sam literally saves Toby's bacon by convincing his owner not to sell him at market. When Toby demonstrates his remarkable intelligence, it becomes obvious that much more money can be made from touring 'Toby the Sapient Pig' than by selling him as meat. Toby and Sam go to live with Silas Bissett, a mysterious figure on whose estate all manner of trained animals exist in apparent happiness. After a period of study during which Toby learns English, arithmetic and 'mind-reading' tricks, the menagerie embarks on a tour of Britain and Ireland. Toby's adventures see him coming dangerously close to being served up on a dinner table; our porcine protagonist learns that for every charitable human who treats him with kindness and an open mind, there exists a cruel one eager to do him harm. Overcoming all adversity, Toby embarks on studies at Oxford University then later at the University of Edinburgh.

Having Toby as narrator of the story works well. The first-person (or, more correctly, first-pig) narrative is written with such excellence, and from such a uniquely porcine perspective, that the entire tale has a palpable sense of authenticity. The reader is on Toby's side from the start, rooting for the lovable pig throughout his myriad adventures, and fearing for his safety when he finds himself in danger. To anchor the book stylistically in the late 18th Century, Russell Potter has written it in eloquent old-school prose. Even the typeface (Caslon Antique, created in the late 1890s) and capitalisation of key words are true to the 18th Century style.

The story never feels implausible, which is testament to Russell Potter's literary prowess and the lovability of Toby as a main character." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R399RWVX4JVNKF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857862405[HeavyMetalManitou]

[[Morte_D_Urban]]
*Morte D'Urban* (1962)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/9997414411/[Amazon]

*****
This book won the national book award in 1963 for fiction. Our hero Father Urban is a little quirky and self-centered; yet even with those faults it is hard not to sympathize with him. I approached this book with some regret. It was the last of Powers' works I would have the chance to read. So I took my time and slowly read chapter by chapter, savoring the book over a much longer period than I normally would. The book was both satisfying and a bit of a disappointment. It was satisfying in that I have now completed the published books of J. F. Powers. It was also sad because of this fact. It was a bit disappointing in that the story feels unfinished. Like a chapter was left out when it went to printing.

Some of the plot was inevitable, and predictable, but the characters you meet along the way make the book very engaging and entertaining. I am a post Vatican II baby. As such, I do not know the Latin Mass - have only read books, and seen films of what the church was like before that period. Powers is a master at creating characters, and characters that are believable. His priests, brothers, monsignors and even bishops are believable to anyone who has had serious interactions even with clergy of today. I know of a priest locally who could be an Urban walking off the page to take up ministry today.

Many segments of this book were previously published as short stories in a variety of sources. Powers was a master at the short story, but his creative genius was his ability to take those short stories and turn them into a convincing novel. He has done this with both his published novels - this book Morte D'Urban and Wheat That Springeth Green. Both books were nominated for the National Book Award and Urban won. That is the testament to Powers' power and prowess with the quill. It is also witness to his ability to transcend the short story, a genre that appears to be going by the wayside, and to compile books of great depth and insight. Modern author Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, wanted to write a book of short stories, but his publisher, even with his popularity after Fight Club, would not allow him a book of short stories. Then Palauniuk wrote Haunted a collection of characters' personal stories told by a group of writers locked in a building. Powers achieves what Palahniuk does not in that his stories flow together seamlessly, where Palahniuk's are obviously individual stories.

This book is worth the read for anyone wanting a glimpse of insight into post World War II Catholicism, especially in the Midwest. But it is also a great study of people and why they do what they do - what drives them to achieve, their dreams and ultimately their failures and defeats. Unfortunately I have now read all of Powers' fiction. Fortunately the 2 books and 3 collections of short stories can be savored again and again. I can predict I have not finished with reading Powers, or Urban. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32JDEP2GL8TJ9/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9997414411[Steven R. McEvoy]

"This is an oddball book. Towards the end I pressed on the Kindle screen to go the next page and discovered it had finished. Just like that.

But that was only one of its oddities. It's less of a story than a series of chapters over the forty-plus years of Joe Hackett's life, from his appearance as a toddler at an adult's party, where he's seen as cute, to his unexpected isolation - once again -when he's moved from a parish where he's been working with a curate (a man he's had to work hard to get to like, and vice versa) to one where he's on his own again. We don't find out anything about this parish, but it's plain it's like he's once again been thrust into his own soul without any companion.

Hackett becomes a priest (after a Rabelaisian chapter in which he's having sex with two young girls at the same time, as it were), and we journey with him through his hair-shirt days at the Seminary, where he's only marginally popular, through his administration work and his parish work. He never seems to want to enjoy any of these things, though he's good at them all, and known to be by the other priests. Sometimes he's plain obtuse, and refuses to help himself. Sometimes he's right on the button spiritually when no one else seems to be. He's a curious and not altogether likeable character.

I couldn't figure out where Powers was going with it all, for quite some time. Got to about 40% of the way through and considered giving up. And yet Powers' writing is such that when he does get going, you can't put the book down.

One of the saving graces of the book is the wry, understated humour. It's often satirical, but mostly in the subtlest way. It doesn't take Joe as seriously as he takes himself, which is a gift. And between the humour is the yearning by the reader (and author) for this character to ease up a bit on himself. Not that you want him to be any less spiritual than he is, but you want him to give himself a break. Sainthood isn't achieved by endlessly beating yourself around the head - Joe's equivalent in the later parts of the book of his wearing of the hair-shirt in the earlier parts.

He's surrounded by men who are doing their best in a difficult job, and by men who seem just plain gnarly in their approach to the priesthood. And he's concerned about the faith - or lack of it - of many of his parishioners (and some of the priests), and about his own drinking problems (not over the top, but sometimes close to it). And about his loneliness, which he tries to ride roughshod over.

I can't say I enjoyed all of it, or found myself at home in it (though, having been brought up as a Catholic, it had a kind of familiarity about it). But it has more depth than it seems, and makes you think more than you realise. I'm not entirely sure, always, about what...there's quite a lot of stuff worth thinking about here!" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S165NWWH125R/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322242[M.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Nocturnal-Butterflies-Russian-Empire-Manuel/dp/0571200206/[Amazon]

*****
The narrator of "Nocturnal Butterflies," simply named J., is a smuggler crisscrossing the borders of post-Soviet Europe and dealing in contraband such as night-vision goggles. Stockis, a wealthy and shadowy butterfly collector from Sweden, engages J. to find the yazikus, a nocturnal specimen that is extremely rare and difficult to catch. While in Istanbul, however, J. falls in love with an equally elusive "nocturnal butterfly" of a different sort: a prostitute named V. Trapped in Turkey by an Armenian thug who lured her there under false pretenses, V. enlists J. to help her escape her bondage and return to Russia, only to vanish when they both arrive.

All this is made known to the reader in the first few pages, and the bulk of the novel details seven letters he unexpectedly receives from V. while at a pension in Livadia, recounts the events that led to J.'s abandonment and despair, and describes his attempt to construct an appropriate response, a letter that will make his feelings known to V. and bring her back to him. He assembles their story in bits and pieces, much "like the mental process I am using here in Livadia, reconstructing her from the fragmented image in her letters."

While planning his own letter, J. enlists the help of epistles by famous literary and historical figures, from Saul of Tarsus and Abelard to Oscar Wilde and the Russian double agent Evno Azef. And, of course, the butterflies, the letters, the narrative technique, the Russian themes, the immigrant experience (both the author and J. are Cubans who immigrated to Russia)--all rather deliberately recall Nabokov, who was a famous lepidopterist himself. Prieto skillfully weaves these literary, historical, and biographical details into his own rich narrative, and the result is a collage of compellingly topical yet hauntingly resonant passages.

Breaking the density of these musings, which are best appreciated slowly and piecemeal, are the description of J. and V.'s evolving (if one-sided) love affair in Istanbul and a plot drawn from an international thriller, which reaches an unexpected crescendo in a terrific chase scene.

Cuban cubism is the facetious label one could use for the novel's structure. A drawback with cubism as a technique in prose, though, is that no matter how solid and invigorating the individual pieces, stepping back from the work reveals both its thematic richness and a narrative jumble. Such bipolarity can certainly work in a painting, but whether it succeeds in fiction will depend entirely on the assiduousness of the individual reader. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8UNU3CDR23N/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571200206&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[D.

[[Rex]]
*Rex: A Novel* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Rex-Novel-Jose-Manuel-Prieto/dp/B008SLZFDU/[Amazon]

*****
This novel by Cuban-born, Russian-educated José Manuel Prieto is narrated by a tutor (who asks to be called Psellus) and directed to his pupil, eleven-year-old Petya, the son of two Russian émigrés living in luxury on Spain's Costa del Sol. Petya's parents, Vasily and Nelly, are hiding from two Russian mafiosos they swindled out of millions in a scheme involving fake diamonds. But, in Rex, appearances are highly questionable, and the purported swindle could be merely a tool used by Vasily and Nelly to persuade Psellus to do their bidding, including transforming Vasily into the long-lost czar of Russia. Whatever the truth, plot is secondary in Prieto's unique literary creation that is Rex.

Psellus derives his lessons to the young Petya, and indirectly to the reader, exclusively from the Book, Psellus's name for Proust's In Search of Lost Time:
"If you receive nothing more from me than some knowledge of the details of the Book, if in all your adult life you don't manage to retain any more than a few passages, a few scattered phrases of the Book, that would be enough to give you a distinct advantage as you go out into the world. Only through the Book can you learn to judge men sensibly, plumb their depths, detect and comprehend their obscurest motives, sound the abyss of their souls."
Psellus's other influences include the supremely worthy Writer, who is really an amalgamation of numerous writers, including Shakespeare, Nabokov, and Dostoyevsky, and the despicable Commentator, quite likely intended as a stand-in for Jorge Luis Borges, and perhaps even, at times, for Prieto himself.

Prieto's prose defies description. It's unlike anything else I've read recently (or maybe ever). It's a highly referential banter of thoughts, images, dialog, and questions to the reader. Often lacking in subjects or verbs or other generally indispensable parts of sentences, Prieto's sentences are obscure and difficult, but also loaded with charm and humor. Esther Allen's flexible, lively translation is its own work of art. As demonstrated by this scene where Psellus steals a dance with the beautiful but unattainable Nelly, Allen captures the musicality and exuberance of Prieto's language:
"In which the two of us danced, Nelly's face and mine, our faces consumed by fire, the blue tongues of my passion, the impulse that led me to inhale the aroma of her hair, bewitched by the arc of her brows, revolving at the center of a slow song that astonished me when I heard its first chords because I said to myself: jazz, but without being able to tell you [Petya], you up in your room at that moment, to interject a rapid commentary, overlooking for the moment the commentaristic (or belated? Or belated) nature of jazz. A song that now, each time I hear it, of course."

Rex is a thoroughly enjoyable literary puzzle for those who embrace originality and can accept some amount of confusion for a little over 300 pages (if the quote above brings fear to your heart, you should probably skip this one). This book begs a second reading, which I suspect would be even more pleasurable than the first. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R31LI7G7GCFMQZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SLZFDU&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[G.

*****
While in one of my frequent trips to England, I chanced upon this series of books set in Aberystwyth, my family's ancestral home; hence a read was irresistable.

There are four of them published to date (more please), and you should read them in order as the characters recur in each book and are introduced sequentially. Although the characterization is best in the later books as Pryce gets going.

Simply put, they are zany. Pryce not only weaves fantasy into Wales (but remember that Arthurian tales emanate from nearby), but throws in Wittgensteinian metaphysics. As an aside, Druids control the Aberystwyth mafia. I certainly have no idea if his geography is accurate (see other reviews on this page), and I know that I did not recognize all the allusions, but he a much more profound writer than would be suggested. He provokes some pretty good questions about how we perceive one another and the extent to which fraternal love and ordinary (perhaps extraordinary love) happen day-to-day.

As other reviewers have noted, you have to read awhile before you catch on. A Hasidic-murdered Santa Claus working for the Mossad mixed with a Welsh invasion of Argentina are hard to follow, but the stories do weave together if you are patient. While you are waiting for the mystery to unravel, you are well entertained by the Dr. Who-like silliness described in Aberystwyth.

Even the movie title book titles are a little abstract. Are they gimics or do they allude to the content? Even after reading all four I am still not sure.

In a literary world drab with overwraught themes, these books stand far apart for entertainment value, provocative thought, and tortuous plot evolution. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R33R94H0HIS097/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0747557861&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[G.

" "The foolish and short-sighted policy of the first two Stewarts was not likely to diminish, in any way, this bitter feeling against the unholy amusement which they favoured and protected. Instead, it raised up a fresh engine of reform before which both court and stage, eventually, went down. In 1625, the year of Charles's accession, an anonymous puritan opened a new, and, in the light of subsequent events, an ominous line of attack. It was hopeless to ask the crown to cleanse the Augean stables, and the city had long since given up the task in despair; he, therefore, addressed himself to parliament, round which the hopes of all reformers were beginning to cluster. His petition, calling itself A Short Treatise against Stage-Playes, is a brief and exceedingly businesslike enumeration of the chief arguments against the drama. In these twenty-eight pages may be found the whole gist of Histriomastix; indeed, the tract reads so much like a first draft of its unwidely successor that the suspicion is forced upon us that it was either written by Prynne himself, who as we know, began to collect his materials in 1624, or taken by him from another writer to be made the basis of his book.

When we of the twentieth century hold in our hands the cube of printed matter known as Histriomastix, and turn over its eleven hundred pages, in which marginal notes and references to authorities, for the most part, long since forgotten, often take up more room than the text itself, we find it very difficult to realise just what the book meant in its own day. To us, it seems half pathetic and half ridiculous, a gigantic monument of misplaced energy and zeal, a pyramid left gaunt and useless on the sands of time. To a great extent, the work was the outcome of a peculiar personality. Prynne was a fanatic of that indomitable and most intolerant kind - the moral enthusiast. Apparently with very little of the milk of human kindness in his composition, he burned with an internal flame of righteous conviction, and this alone could have sustained him, not merely in his sufferings, but, also, in those untiring labours which his pen produced, over and above the immense Histriomastix. Yet, at the same time, he was thoroughly representative, his idiosyncrasies being extreme developments of, rather than departures from, the normal characteristics of his fellow reformers. If it be ever possible for one man to sum up a movement in his own person, Prynne summed up puritanism. And, since his book epitomises, likewise, the whole puritan attack upon the stage, a consideration of author and book together form a suitable close to the present study. ..." - https://www.bartleby.com/216/1416.html[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907-21).

*Malcolm: A Comic Novel* (1959)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Malcolm-Comic-Novel-James-Purdy/dp/0871409577/[Amazon]

*****
Malcolm is a novel which, because of its measured simplicity, is extraordinarily complex. It is a highly stylised fable in which the surreal is presented as entirely conventional. There is an extreme sense of disconnection, of alienation. This is a depiction of a society where the individual has lost his sense of belonging and where meaning has become arbitrary. It is also extremely funny.

The story begins in picaresque fashion, with Malcolm being introduced in successive chapters to a range of unusual individuals. Malcolm is first presented to us sitting on a bench day after day, waiting. Just waiting. He has lost his father - literally so, as he doesn't appear to have died, he simply isn't there - which one would ordinarily take to be symbolic of the end of childhood or reaching maturity, but this clearly isn't the case with Malcolm. Paradox is at the heart of this novel. Malcolm is an innocent who cannot engage with the world. He is taken in hand by the peculiar Mr. Cox, who arranges for him to meet, in turn, a range of his acquaintances.

Malcolm orbits these people's worlds and everything shifts. Everything, that is, except Malcolm, who remains throughout impervious to the dramas building around him. These people are eccentric, extreme, anomalies, and at certain times surreal. Each of these extraordinary characters is introduced as coolly as though they were merely a range of everyday functionaries.

Yet all of this is told in a deliberately flat style, almost banal, and the characterisation is strictly two-dimensional. The characters are established as stereotypes representing different aspects of American culture - philistines and aesthetes, revealing greed, neuroticism, irreality - and through their responses and lack of responses the hopelessness at the heart of American society is revealed.

I felt the novel ended too quickly; I was still thirsty for more. Purdy probably intended for it to end abruptly. Life, Purdy may be telling us, is meaningless. Existence is absurd. It consists of events and happenings, all unavoidable, all simultaneously significant and meaningless. They touch you, wound even, ultimately kill, yet somehow existence appears to obtain in a bubble outside of the self. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RK6YO1ROS3Z42/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871409577&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Samer A.

"Hubert, a writer, has lost the main character to the novel he is, well was, writing. After viciously accusing friends and fellow writers of stealing Icarus, he hires the detective Morcol, "who has appeared in many novels under different names," to find him. Soon we meet Icarus, who is only 15 pages old and on his own in 1890 Paris, and begin to see the formation from what Hubert designed, to a real character through his first experience with absinthe, his girlfriend LN, his love of automobiles and bicycles, and his love of flying machines. Barbara Wright has done nice work with the translation although the tone does change abruptly towards the end without apparent reason (some readers may know her translation of Alfred Jarry's, Ubu Roi). Queneau wrote this novel in the form of a play which adds to the borderline absurdist and fast-paced story. One almost believes that the story is really about the process of writing a novel as characters elude and morph and disappear. This is a very easy to read, yet highly irregular work that is highly recommended for its creativity and execution. Readers may also enjoy other works by Queneau and his writing group formed in the 1960's called the OULIPO." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3USTM5U4PL5XF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811204839[Jeff O.]

*****
"If you decide to read Zazie in the Metro, don't be surprised to find yourself thinking a bit like the story's quirky cast of characters: speaking with charmingly wordy phrases (e.g., "Picking up a syphon he purposed to cause its mass to reverberate against Gabriel's skull," rather than, "he hit Gabriel in the head with a bottle."), and forming words using unusual spellings (e.g., "Tsnot true, unkoo" instead of, "It's not true, uncle."). You may even find yourself looking at the world through Zazie's wide eyes, seeing things with the innocence of a child narrated with a vocabulary like Charles Bukowski's.

I pity poor translator Barbara Wright -- author Raymond Queneau's preferred translator, from what I understand -- for what must have been buckets of perspiration shed in what could have only worked as a labor of love. After all, this is a book is more about language and dialogue than it is about anything that could be mistaken for a plot.

The other main source of Zazie in the Metro's charm comes from its unusual roll call of characters. Aside from the always-interesting Zazie, the book offers the quixotic and curious "Unkoo" Gabriel, his dour sometimes foil Gridoux, and even a parrot called Laverdure, whose solitary line -- "Talk, talk, that's all you can do" -- seems to get blurted out only with exceptional timing.

It's easy to understand how this colorful tale inspired a generation of French readers and writers. It is even said to have had a hold on Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director of the wonderful and similarly playful film, Amelie.

Compared to all this, the plot of this story hardly seems worth mentioning: young Zazie comes to Paris to visit her uncle, but what she really wants to do is ride on the metro for the first time. Because of a strike, she can't, and she compensates with a string of other adventures.

Up until this point, I know, this does not sound like a three-star review (or three and a half, if that had been possible). I have given Zazie in the Metro what amounts to a so-so rating for reasons I am not too sure how to describe. The best explanation I can come up with is that despite all of the positive points made here, the book just failed to capture me; I never felt like I was part of the story. Somehow, its 157 pages seemed quite a bit longer, and sometimes the action became confused or obscured because of the clever word play. It was like a meal based on ingredients I adore, but which don't quite seem to work well together.

Yes, of course, buy and read Zazie in the Metro. Its place in Europe's literary cannon and the unusual mix of characters and language is enough to make that case. Besides, it's a book that an at least mildly adventurous literate person should know. I'll just hope it will be a bit more of a treat for you than it was for me." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OO396A1B1EA0/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142180041[Eric J. Lyman]

This is one of my favourite Queneau novels. Actually it's one of my favourite novels! In one slim volume Queneau achieves a poignancy and oblique truthfulness that is very rarely found in 'modernist' literature. Much is said of Queneau's technique - the neologisms, anachronisms, puns, mathematics - but to focus on these surface aspects is, in my opinion, partly missing the point. Queneau puts all of himself into his works and these technical aspects reflect his deep love of language and recognition of the fact that a novel is essentially an 'artificial' creation. Why shouldn't the writer do as he pleases? But there is much more to the man Queneau. Aside from his linguistic play, his works are always deeply humane. It is enlightening to read Queneau's list of 100 favourite novels. Aswell as Jacques the Fatalist you will find Hemingway, Faulkner and Dickens. Queneau, like Calvino, considers himself a reader first, writer second. Like Calvino he considers reading itself an art form. Certainly he calls upon us to exercise our 'artistic' talents but also he requires us to see each of his novels as an 'artifact', as simply 'some writing'. A good novel can be like a window: giving us a 'view' of some created world, or focussing our attention on the 'pane of glass' itself; Queneau's novels do both. We are voyeurs of the bumbling of his characters but we can also see the frame, never forgetting that this is a novel that we're reading. And so Valentin Bru, like all his most endearing characters, is a person and an archetype. He embodies the deepest concerns of the novel (he is a naif, gifted with the "good humour" that means he "cannot be fundamentally bad or base", encapsulating the quote by Hegel with which the novel begins) and yet we can empathise with him as a typically flawed specimen of humanity, trying to pass his time on Earth as painlessly as possible. Like Pierrot (Pierrot mon ami), like Cidrolin (The Blue Flowers), like Alfred (The Last Days). It is my belief that all these novels, all these characters, ask the same question: why do we do what it is we do? Queneau always seems to answer, never unequivocally ofcourse: because we are human. Valentin Bru does what he does because it doesn't matter what he does, he could do something else, or not. Queneau's characters and novels have no bounds, no limitations. They suggest and accept all possibilities. This is what makes his work, and The Sunday of Life especially, so profoundly and poignantly humane." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YELYAHEYDO7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811206467[Ralphus]

"We Always Treat Women Too Well was first published as a purported work of pulp fiction by one Sally Mara, but this novel by Raymond Queneau is a further manifestation of his sly, provocative, wonderfully wayward genius. Set in Dublin during the 1916 Easter rebellion, it tells of a nubile beauty who finds herself trapped in the central post office when it is seized by a group of rebels. But Gertie Girdle is no common pushover, and she quickly devises a coolly lascivious strategy by which, in very short order, she saves the day for king and country. Queneau's wickedly funny send-up of cheap smut—his response to a popular bodice-ripper of the 1940s—exposes the link between sexual fantasy and actual domination while celebrating the imagination's power to transmute crude sensationalism into pleasure pure and simple." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159017030X/[Amazon]

*****
"'The Blue Flowers' is the most lovable of all Raymond Queneau's novels, one of those rare books you never want to end (for me, the only others I can think of are 'Huckleberry Finn' and 'Dance to the music of time'). It relates two paralell narratives (or rather - and Queneau is the great mathematical novelist! - base and perpendicular narratives): the historical narrative of the endearingly aggressive Duc d'Auge, nay-sayer to royal authority and public opinion, friend of Gilles de Rais and the Marquis de Sade, and debunker of religion to the extent of daubing on caves in the Perigord region to 'prove' the existence of humanity before Adam; his three daughters, including the defective, bleating Phelise, and their small-minded spouses; his squire Mouscaillot and their talking horses, philosophical Demosthenes and taciturn Stef; and his clerical foils, the abbes Biroton and Riphinte. We meet the Duke at 175 year historical intervals - refusing to rejoin the barbarous crusades in 1264, and forced to slaughter disapproving bourgeoisie; investing in new weaponry, most notably the cannon, in defence of his castle in 1439; dabbling in alchemy in 1614; fleeing the French Revolution in 1789. Throughout he hunts, visits the capital, marries woodcutters' young daughters, feasts ferociously, and debates with his clergy.

From the terrifying active Duke, the contemporary story focuses on passive Cidrolin, once wrongly convicted for a crime for which he is still persecuted by an unknown graffiti artist who daubs obscene accusations on his fence every night. Now living on a barge, drinking endless glasses of essence of fennel, he doesn't do much, giving directions to tourists, staring at construction sites or the nearby camping site. Any trip out of the ordinary invariably finds him back where he started; conversations are banal and repetitive. Like the Duke, he has three daughters and sons-in-law, a dead wife and the first name Joachim. He spends most of his time taking siestas, dreaming of the Duke. When the Duke sleeps, usually replete from an enormous meal, he dreams of Cidrolin. Queneau says his book's starting point was the old Chinese saying about a philosopher - When he went to sleep, he dreamt of a butterfly; when he woke up, he wondered whether he was a butterfly dreaming of a philosopher.

'Flowers' is, according to the experts, Queneau's most dense and philosophical novel, an intimidating mixture of Chinese philosophy, 'Finnegan's Wake', Plato, Hegel etc. It certainly deals with Big Themes, such as History, Time, Cosmology, Art, the Importance and Interpretation of Dreams. But for the less intellectually alert amongst us (including me), 'Flowers' offers sundry, more accessible pleasures. The comic set-pieces, which can arise from slapstick; bathos and deflated rhetoric; the deadpan recording of absurd conversations, and the absurd convolutions of deadpan conversations. the characters, from whom biography and psychology is deliberately and crucially elided, nevertheless end up being so completely endearing you don't want to leave them. The eulogy to dreams and their subversive power over official history. The detective story element - what crime was Cidrolin accused of? Who is his persector? Why is the watchman of the camp spying on him? Who sabotaged the new flats? Mostly, 'Flowers' is a joy for its language: the historical settings and wide social range of characters allowing for an Augian feast of archaic and obsolete words, jaw-breaking technical terms, slang, puns, neologisms, for all of which Barbara Wright finds delightful and rich equivalents in the wealth of English life and literature. So inventive, audacious and important is her translating, she should really be credited as the book's co-author." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVULL9YNG36RR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811227928[darragh o'donoghue]

*****
"Horacio Quiroga (1878-1937) is not a name that I think most English-speaking readers know.

One part de Maupassant for fluidity; one part Kafka for the uncanny or Freud's das Unheimliche; and one part Edgar Allan Poe for psychological horror and; the last portion belongs to him alone: his own inimitable narrative and plots; and what we have is a writer to admire, one who preceded all of the magic realist writers. Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Arturo Uslar Pietri - in Latin American literature; Massimo Bontempelli, among Italian writers; and Salman Rushdie, Toni Morrison, and Angela Carter in the English-speaking world - all owe a debt to Horacio Quiroga.

Quiroga is a writer primarily concerned with illusions and human foibles. In "The Dead Man," a man determined to tame Nature slips by accident and falls on his machete, denying to the end that his workaholic intensity is for naught. He is dying and as he dies the reader sees through the protagonist's eyes as the macroscopic winnows and narrows to the microscopic and then nothingness. In "A Slap in the Face," a tyrannical boss mistakes a stoical worker's silence for weakness until the worker turns on him, using the Boss Man's own riding crop for revenge, in a scene worthy of "Cool Hand Luke."

To generalize, Latin American writers are known for weaving political commentary into their narrative and, for good reason, given the histories of the various countries, but Quiroga is hardly political. His commentary, if any, is cautionary, and I'd argue, a warning about our disrespect for Nature. Quiroga is an ecological writer of paramount importance. That he spent most of his life in and out of the jungles of the Misiones in the northwest of Argentina informs many of his stories. The jungles, the rivers, and animal life figure large. Nature in all of its manifestations is wild, untamable, and should be respected. An excellent demonstration of this is his story "Juan Darién," in which a tiger is raised as a boy but eventually rejects humanity because humans obsess about differences rather than focus on the common need for love and family. Read "Darién" and then find and read Borges's "Blue Tigers."

Several of his stories deal with the horrific and the perverse. "The Feather Pillow" is a vampiric story that involves a wasting disease of unknown etiology and a pillow. "Sunstroke" is told from a dog's perspective about his master's innate stupidity. I can't even describe the unexpected outcome of the story, "The Decapitated Chicken," which involves four insufferable, bratty children.

While dialogue is not prevalent in his work but keeping J.K. Rowling's use of snakes in mind, sit back and read Quiroga's "Anaconda," which uses dialogue effectively and is a fascinating short story-novella about an alliance between non-venomous and venomous snakes against scientists in the jungle collecting snake venom to develop anti-venom serum for every species of venomous snake. Aside the pharmaceutical exploitation that Quiroga could never have imagined, he creates a remarkable metaphor for strength with his heroic Anaconda, which, incidentally, is female.

The Margaret Sayers Peden translation that I have cites the out of print Exiles (1926, Los Desterrados in Spanish) and Stories of Love, Madness, and Death (1917, Cuentos de Amor, de Locura y de Muerte) as Quiroga highpoints. The introductory essay alludes to a "Manual of the Perfect Short Story Writer" that Quiroga wrote for aspiring writers, but I am unable to find it in book form.

In all the years I have been reading, it hasn't been often find the lives of writers terribly interesting, but I have to say that in the few biographical details that I have read about Horacio Quiroga I am convinced that there has been no other writer who has had a more cursed life. His father died in an accident with a shotgun. Horacio's stepfather, when he had become quite ill, killed himself. Horacio had been the one to discover the body. Quiroga's first wife committed suicide, leaving him with two small children. When they had grown up, they too became suicides. Sadly, when Quiroga was suffering from intractable pain from advanced prostate cancer, he chose to end his life with cyanide, but not before leaving over two hundred short stories to posterity." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSG2RMRBDKSHW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0292715412[Gabriel Valjan]

[[The_Trial_of_Sir_John_Falstaff]]
*The Trial of Sir John Falstaff, Wherein the Fat Knight is Permitted to Answer for Himself* (1893)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://books.google.com/books?id=zuyhyqhdXcUC[Google Books]

******
"Falstaff as been so thoroughly bewritten that whoever attempts to say anything new of Sir John will soon find that he can do little more than borrow the thoughts of Shakespearian scholars, criss-cross what they have written about the fat knight, scribble at random in the narrow margins of their ample pages, and make a cento of quotations therefrom.* This book is the result of an endeavor, not simply to repeat what critics have said of Sir John, but rather to put him in such a predicament that he must speak for himself and serve as his own commentator, and, in so speaking, interweave into his discourse, as far as it is possible, the very words which he uses, here and there, in the dramas wherein
he plays his part; and, further, to give his companions, Bardolph, Nym, Poins, Peto, Pistol, Mrs. Quickly, Justice Shallow, and the rest—each and all —a chance to do the like. Royal Hal must, of course, be counted out of this group, for it is to be presumed that the order which he made on his coronation-day, banishing Falstaff, on pain of death, "Not to come near our person by ten mile," remained in full force and effect ever after. Moreover, King Hal, having rid himself of his unyoked humors, and thrown off his loose behavior, and being no longer " engraffed to Falstaff," was preparing to invade France and win a glorious victory at Agincourt.

To enable Falstaff to realize his own words during the scene wherein Sir John and Hal act, interchangeably, the part of the King and the Prince, to wit, " Play out the play: I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff," he is supposed to have been "had up " before Shallow and Silence, two of the King's justices of the peace in the county of Gloucester, to answer an information wherein many and grievous public offences were formulated against him. It may be objected that the two Gloucestershire justices had no jurisdiction of Falstaff in Eastcheap, London; that Justice Shallow was plainly prejudiced against Sir John; that many of the so-called crimes charged against him were not crimes at all, and frivolous ; that the justices could not have examined him in the unique manner stated; and that the account of the trial is full of anachronisms of thought and language, and so forth. It may
be answered that the supposed trial is hardly more irregular in many respects than Falstaff's first examination before Chief Justice Sir William Gascoigne. Granting that this great magistrate had the right to intercept Sir John on a London street, and tax him with having refused to obey the summons served upon him to attend at his Lordship's chambers, that he might answer the information laid against him on account of the robbery at Gadshill, still it plainly appears in the report of the examination that the legal altercation between the Chief Justice and Sir John was not conducted according to any known code of criminal procedure. In this very amusing interview, the questions and answers are, in the main, impertinent to the felony charged against Sir John; and, as soon as he has made a sufficient answer to the threat of the Chief Justice to " lay him by the heels," that magistrate partly pulls off his judicial robe and thenceforth acts the part of Prtzfectus Morum, or "superintendent of manners," in dealing with the defendant. Granting, also, that when Falstaff was brawling with Officers Fang and Snare, who were trying to arrest him for debt at the suit of Dame Quickly, the Chief Justice had the right to intervene and command the belligerents to keep the peace, still the main controversy between Sir William and Sir John on that occasion is more personal than judicial in its character.

In the report of Falstaff's examination before Justices Shallow and Silence, the truth of his declaration to Prince Hal that he was "no coward," seems not to have been seriously brought in question. But whoever has read Maurice Morgann's Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff*—written specially to vindicate the fat knight's courage—will probably think that, on this particular issue, judgment ought to go in favor of Falstaff.

The critic, if he looks into this book, may pronounce the circumstantial story of the discovery of the manuscript notes of Falstaff's examination before Shallow and Silence, JJ., as well as the trial itself, as all "too thin," and render judgment accordingly.

It may be so as to the entire book—except the excerpted parts thereof; but I will only say, as lawyers sometimes say when they proffer evidence which they surmise that the court will regard as unimportant, " I offer it for what it is worth." - Preface

*****
This novel was published in French in 1924 and translated into English in 1927. It was written under a pen name by Roger Poidatz, a Frenchman who lived in Japan for a time between the end of World War I and 1924. Donald Richie, the American writer on Japanese subjects for more than 60 years, has called it one of the most observant and honest novels ever written on the nation, as well as the best novel on Japan written by a foreigner. Little information is available in English on Poidatz, but it appears that he published very little besides this book.

It was set in Japan in the early 1920s. It began in Tokyo's Ueno Park, where a young Swiss man with seduction on his mind invited a local woman to accompany him on a daytrip to Enoshima, a seaside resort to the south. He intended their trip to end up at a local hotel. (The author's pen name--which sounds in Japanese like "Shall we stay the night?"--was a play on this invitation.) Unfortunately for the seducer, a Japanese acquaintance invited himself along for the day and things snowballed from there, as more and more people were drawn into the excursion.

Each chapter of the book was written from the viewpoint of a different participant, all but one of whom were Japanese. There was the local girl, who was concerned almost entirely with how best to show off her clothes, in minute detail, and who took along a girlfriend, a mother and a baby. The foreigner's Japanese acquaintance, who invited several business connections he wanted to impress with the foreign presence. The pathetic foreigner himself, who knew nothing of what he'd set in motion. The stationmaster at a rail stop near Enoshima, who together with the local police was tasked with monitoring the foreigner for security reasons. The mother invited by the girl, who was concerned most of all with decorating her new baby with good luck charms. The owner of the hotel in Enoshima where everyone ended up, who sought to use the Western presence to her lodging's advantage. A geisha at the hotel, who observed the evening's festivities with boredom and disdain for the foreigner's boorish ways. (For instance, he quickly spit out the local version of "Bordo.") And finally, a local student who encountered one of the characters late at night along the beach.

The humorous ironies in the book were many. Although the foreigner had started things off, he rapidly became little more than a bystander, a footnote, as everyone else used him for their own purposes. He was ignorant of and entirely uninterested in the local culture. His only concern, sex, was far down the list of everyone else's priorities: enjoying a change of scene, displaying one's clothing, spying, advancing a business, and so on. Not that they didn't have a place for sex. The foreigner could've saved himself much trouble by just checking into a hotel and making a private arrangement.

Most characters were mocked, together with local and foreign ways, but it was the Japanese who received the bulk of the author's attention. In abundant display were an obsession with keeping up appearances suitable to one's station and making the right impression at all costs. Rounds of elaborate gift-giving. The frequent expression of the opposite of what was felt. The lack of what a Westerner might call a sense of proportion. A focus on minute detail--the right color for a kimono sash, the best lucky charm to buy--to the exclusion of all else. Undertakings that grew to require the planning of campaigns. Authorities' over-riding concern with the nation's honor. Frequent misunderstandings of foreign ways, combined with a search for differences over similarities. And mixed feelings of superiority and humility before the foreigner--the former thought, the latter expressed.

The details certainly attested to the author's power of observation in a place he knew only briefly, and to his ability to write beyond race-based stereotypes of his time. gift for impersonating characters from a culture not his own. How much the book is enjoyed, on the other hand, might depend in part on how closely you're attuned to his depiction, funny though it often was. For this reader, it was difficult to care much about any of the characters, they served mainly as butts of the author's humor.

Most of the book was written as farce, with a surprising twist in mood at the end. Was the twist intended to deepen the reader's appreciation of the local people and values? And how affectionate, ultimately, was the author's mockery? In the end it seemed unclear, and maybe this ambiguity was another of the writer's achievements.

The novel was a very early attempt by a foreign author to describe Japanese characters' points of view. Later ones included Richie's Companions of the Holiday (1968) and Audrey Hepburn's Neck (1996) by Alan Brown. Depressingly, it was only in Brown's work that a Japanese and a foreigner succeeded eventually in finding common ground. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5NBP85CDDHO/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0710312008&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Reader in Tokyo]

*****
"DAVID RECK smiles out from the back flap of his book like some happy totem from the 1960's. And, indeed, from its title onward, “Music of the Whole Earth” is like some artifact from that loving, ecumenical decade.

The reason is that Mr. Reck—and his wife, Carol, who selected the book's numerous photographs—are determined to embrace the whole world's music. The book is divided into two sections, the first historical and the second a topical breakdown of musical styles, instruments and forms of performance throughout the world today. This is a book that tries industriously to say it all—to break music down into its basic structures and to show how the same ideas manifest themselves in the most resultant links between isolated musical disparate cultures.. There are chapters on the spread of civilization and the resultant links between isolated musical cultures today, on the parallels between instrumental types (e. g., the Western oboe and the Indian shehnai), on the similarities between varying forms of musical organization (symphony orchestra, Balinese gamelan). There is even a section—further fulfilling the “Whole Earth Catalogue” intimations of the title—that shows you how to make your own folk instruments.

Mr. Reck's background gives a good idea of the breadth of his interests and the qualifications he brings to his task. Born in Rising Star, Tex., he worked his way through college as a country and jazz musician, and then studied “seriously” at the University of Pennsylvania under George Rochberg. He has received Rockefeller and Guggenheim grants, and lived in India between 1968 and 1971, where he mastered the veena, a South Indian stringed instrument. He studied ethnomusicology at Wesleyan, and currently teaches at the New School in New York and at Amherst College.

The point of view of this book—sometimes stated explicity, always implied—is that Western art‐music has no lock on the human spirit, and that different cultures express human aspirations in different ways. That not only means such obviously refined examples of non‐Western music as the Chinese, the Indian or the Indonesian, but more popular and primitive traditions, as well. They are all worthy of equal seriousness and respect for Mr. Reck, and soon enough one comes to appreciate the openness of his attitude.

This book can serve admirably as a text for untraditional music courses; even the relatively short, seemingly naive discussions of our own tradition are actually handled with a good deal of sophistication. Throughout the book, Mr. Reck takes pains to break down music's structure and textures by means of simple verbal descriptions and (sometimes crudely drawn) diagrams, and, often as not, they betray a really original musical mind.

Mr. Reck may be an aging 1960's hippie, to judge by his looks and by the forms and the sometimes rather random organization of his book. But in the end there is nothing wrong with that. For the last 100 years, Western music has realized with a mixture of apprehension and eagerness that it is really but one small part of a very large musical picture. Mr. Reck takes that realization as a premise, and moves on to give us a refreshing insight, free from cutural bias, into the way the musical world really is." - https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/27/archives/books-worlds-music.html[John Rockwell]

*****
The hero is PaPa LaBas, a New Orleans "houngan" who is trying to discover the source (the Text) of a "psychic plague" called "Jes Grew" which is sweeping the nation in the 1920s (whether you interpret it to mean Ragtime or the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance). J.G.C.s, or its "carriers," are overcome by a passionate desire to dance and have a good time. Their militant wing, the "Mu'tafikah" (I love that name), are involved in activities like art-napping non-Western artifacts (African masks and sculpture, a giant Olmec head from Central America) from the Center of Art Detention (which not surprisingly, has the same address as the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and returning them to the places where they come from. They're opposed by the "Atonists" (the bluenoses, those dedicated to the glorification of Western culture, the Protestant work ethic, etc.) and its affiliated organization, the Wallflower Order (whose motto is "Lord, if I can't dance, no one will"). Reed's work always lampoons historical figures, fictional and literary characters, and especially religion. The character named "Hinckle Von Vampton" (a parody of Carl Van Vechten, the literary agent for many black writers in the 1920s) is a Wallflower member who infiltrates the Harlem community to manipulate its artists and destroy the movement. He plans to start a magazine featuring a Talking Android who will tell the J.G.C.s that Jes Grew is not ready for primetime and "owes a large debt to Irish Theater." Reed satirizes everyone and everything from Warren G. Harding's ancestry to Irene Castle, the dance instructor who was used by the Establishment to show Americans the "Castle Way," and denounce the so-called Animal Dances (many with Black origins, like the "Turkey Trot," the "Bunny Hug," the "Chicken Scratch, the "Possum Trot," etc) as "ugly," "ungraceful," and "out of fashion." You always learn something about American history and culture by reading an Ishmael Reed novel, although not always immediately. At the top of page 184 is a photo of what appears to be a black clergyman surrounded by three rows of mostly African-American men in formal wear, including W.E.B. Du Bois. The photo at the bottom of the page is of a diverse group, including the author, standing around a statue of Buddha with mountains in the background. Does it mean anything? I'm not sure, however, I think that during this period there was resistance to jazz music by some of the African-American elite, and although I'm not qualified to comment on Du Bois's views, the photo could be a kind of satirizing. I know that James Weldon Johnson (who is referred to in the novel, as are Harlem Renaissance figures Claude McKay, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, and the fictional Nathan Brown) praised Black music and co-wrote some famous music and lyrics. But I'm not even going to venture a guess about the intended target of Reed's satire in the character of Hubert "Safecracker" Gould, Von Vampton's colleague who delivers the hilarious epic poem, "Harlem Tom Toms" (for BJF) to a high-society audience. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQS4092JSGPV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684824779&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

[[Flight_to_Canada]]
*Flight to Canada* (1998)

http://www.amazon.com/Flight-Canada-Ishmael-Reed/dp/0684847507/[Amazon]

*****
With unarmed black men being shot in the back by white cops on an almost daily basis in this country, I needed some psychological balm, some distancing, some art to express the insanity. Paul Beatty's brilliant "The Sellout" provided up-to-the minute topicality and an appropriately withering scorn to encapsulate the outrage. But I recalled Ishmael Reed, a time forty years ago when I tried "The Free-Lance Pallbearers" and didn't know what to make of it. Was I a more receptive reader now? Would Reed have anything to say to our current, appalling state of affairs?

The answer, at least in "Flight to Canada," was a resounding yes. In fact this novel, though shorter, may say more with less than Beatty's. Reed uses more flamboyant literary devices: conflating centuries is wild fun but also makes the institution of slavery seem even more bizarre and unconscionable than it would otherwise. Reed knows the minutae of history and sprinkles the novel with unlikely but accurate Civil War facts that fit in well with scenarios that include Greyhound Bus trips and television. Reed teases us with parallels: a slaveholder's son making an anthropological trip to Africa parallels Nelson Rockefeller's, Lincoln's assassination finds parallels in JFK's. The figure of old Abe, in fact, emerges as far less than heroic, but Jefferson Davis doesn't fare too well, either. If Reed expected his reader to see how the outrages of history blend so well with purely outlandish literary concoctions, he has succeeded with me. And moving the concept of one man owning another into relatively modern times (the 70s), or at least with modern references, as I said, brings home the real freakishness of the idea as nothing else could.

The only dated reference I found in "Flight to Canada" was to cassette tapes. All other modern touches are still relevant, including, unfortunately, the callousness of the TV press. And the bizarre, sadistic, dark nature of humanity, with the possibility of a comic, salutary outcome, at least in the short term, seems hard to contest. Truth in outrageousness, and entertainment, too. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1NWC8UW75NS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684847507&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bartolo]

*****
Ishmael Reed is a novelist\poet\essaist\playwright\anthologist. What makes Reed such an intriguing writer is the way he approaches the theme of his work. Never approaching with the "dead-ahead" "straight forward" message in his writing Ishmael Reed takes the subject from every imaginable angle to present a Picasso painting in novel form. Ishmael Reed is the author of "Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down".

General Plot In his novel, "Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down" Ishmael Reed tells the story of a traveling circus group and their adventure in the Old West. The hero of the book is the Loop Garoo Kid, a hoo-doo gunslinger with quick wit, a cool disposition, and a silver tongue. He is traveling with the circus barker, a dancing bear 86-D, and Zozo Labrique, a hoo-doo\voo-doo princes from New Orleans who performs magic after being thrown out of her church. Upon arriving in Yellow Back Radio, which is the town's name, the group discovers their advance man dead, and strung up from a tree. The group gives him a proper burial and proceeds into the town. Upon arriving there they discover that all the adults of the town had been driven out, and the children are now in control of the town. The adults are currently camped out at the spread of the anti-hero Drag Gibson. Drag and his men poisoned the towns water supply with mind altering drugs that caused the adults to fear the children and sign their land over to him. There is not much more than can be told with out giving the plot and the intended surprise that are so delicately placed by Reed in this stirring piece of fiction.
Why Read This Book? First and foremost, Ishmael Reed takes an American institution, the Western Novel and takes a revisionist perspective in turning the piece into a beat novel. Using the beat characteristics of flowing verse dabbling with the occasional rhyme the entire novel, reads like an extended poem. If you are a fan of the Western, you should read this read this novel, for a new perspective on a genre that has strict characteristics and rigid guidelines. This however, is not a dimestore Louis L'amour Western. This is a revisionist Western that takes every stereotype that is common to the Western and turns them upside down For example the Indians are on the side of the children, helping them scout out the surrounding area, "Our Indian informant out at Drag's spread tells us the towns people haven't given in to Drag's conditions yet." Quotes one child's response to the question of where the people are now. To see the Old West through the eyes of a black cowboy will not only show you an unexplored angle probably unfamiliar to the advid Western reader, but will also show that Afro-Americans also had a role in the Old West. However, if you, like I, are not a fan of the Western, do not fear. There are redeeming qualities in this for you as well. This novel is only a Western in the fact that it happens to take place in the West. Aside from that, other areas that are explored by Reed are the role of the youth in society, "It's a plot. We decided that we wouldn't trust anybody graying around the temples", and their inevitable take over, the struggles of writers as their critics criticize them for the angles they don't approach the way the critic feels they should or at all. Conclusion The staggering part of this book is that there is something in it for everyone. No matter your background or personality there is something in this book that will appeal to you, and that you can take with you and pass along. Criticism of the book is that it is hard to follow, and too many issues are tackled at once. In response to that I say, yes, it is hard to follow, at first, but so is Shakespeare. It gets easier as you read, and by the end, it is almost unnoticeable. In response to the criticism that thinks too many things are tackled at once, I respond by saying that when you have a lot to say, a lot gets said. Ishmael Reed shows himself as a brilliant wordcraftsmen, and a philosopher of his generation. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYG9I9ZC72R8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564782387&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*****
"The first of Reig's acclaimed-in-Spain titles to be translated into English (and shortlisted for the Booker-like Premio Fundación Lara in 2003) is at its core a witty, thrill-a-minute detective story, but it ranges exhilaratingly across genres. The book opens with private eye Carlos Clot, hard-boiled but softhearted, being hired to sleuth out what's going on with three women: a teenage runaway; a wife whose husband suspects her of cuckolding him; and, most quirkily, a voluptuous bombshell character missing from the pages of a western novel-in-progress by an alcoholic bestselling author; without her, he has massive writer's block. SF elements creep in: the hyperkinetic novel is set in a vaguely futuristic Madrid, where mysteriously venal Manex Chopeitia heads a genetic-engineering firm that rules the city and, in some vague way, a U.S.-Iberian federation. Next, flashes of the classic western: Carlos's sidekick is laconic cowpoke Spunk McCain, another escapee from that novel-in-progress. Add romance: Carlos remains wistfully but hopelessly hung up on his ex-wife, but by story's end has fallen in love "like a schoolgirl. And with a schoolgirl." There really aren't enough elements of any one genre to satisfy purists, but readers of stylish metafiction should lock right in." - https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Saddle-Rafael-Reig/dp/1852428708/[Amazon]

This volume collects three savage plays from the man André Breton designated as one of the only "true Dadas" (alongside Tristan Tzara and Francis Picabia): The Emperor of China (1916), The Mute Canary (1920) and The Executioner of Peru (1928). The first two have long been acknowledged as highpoints in the Dada movement's contribution to the theater, but in their brutal depictions of violent sexuality and nightmarish tyranny, and their casts of manipulative bureaucrats, murderous henchmen, insane dictators, lascivious virgins, Ubuesque cuckolds and nonsense-spewing enigmas, these plays also echo the work of such other dissident surrealists of the era as Georges Bataille and André Masson. These unsettling theatrical works were significant anticipations of Antonin Artaud's Theater of Cruelty and the Theater of the Absurd of the 1960s. - http://www.amazon.com/Emperor-China-Mute-Canary-Executioner/dp/1939663059/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
In this consummate homage to books, Guatemalan author Rodrigo Rey Rosa introduces the unnamed owner of a bookstore in Guatemala, then moves on to describe the bookseller's life, the books he enjoys, his book-loving friends, and, ultimately the book thief who haunts his store and with whom he falls in love. Writing in clear language without fanciful flourishes, Rey Rosa tells a classic story of love and loss and life and death, and those looking for a simple love story with unusual characters in an exotic setting will be amply rewarded as they meet and follow Severina, the novel's beautiful and unusual "heroine."

The novel is also a complex meditation on books and why people read them; on the value of libraries, both public and private; and on how books contribute to the very essence of life for cultures, societies, and individuals. The narrator of Severina, a writer and part owner of a shop called La Entretenida (meaning "entertaining"), first sees Ana when she attends a reading at his shop, and he knows instinctively that he will see her again. When she attends a second reading, however, he sees her slip two small books of Japanese literature into her bag. He says nothing, preferring to regard her theft as an "outstanding debt, a personal loan from me to you." He is smitten, and he begins to pursue her, "embarking on a purely sentimental adventure...for the first time in my life."

Exotic references, some of them historical and some literary, challenge the reader as the bookseller becomes more and more obsessed with Ana and as she continues to help herself to his books. The narrator knows nothing about where Ana comes from, being unable to place her accent, but her family name, "Blanco," means white, or blank. He likes to believe that her mania for books, "those quivering, murmuring creatures," is associated with "an uncompromising approach to life: absolute freedom, a radical realization of the ideal of living by and for books."

As the bookseller's obsession with Ana continues, the author's literary references grow more eclectic, ranging from Galland's translation of The Thousand and One Nights (1704 - 1715), to books on Russian travel, William Faulkner's Wild Palms, Jorge Reichmann's Conversations Between Alchemists, Thomas Raucat's The Honorable Picnic, various Japanese writings, philosophical treatises, and eventually, Samuel Butler's The Way of All Flesh. A single major presence reigns over the whole novel, however - that of Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges, whose ideas and works permeate every aspect of the action.

The conclusion solves the requirements of the plot with great flair, once again with the "help" of Borges and the imagery associated with him. Irony takes on new meanings, leaving the reader with a smirk, if not a smile. Clever and thoughtful (though sometimes self-conscious and precious), Rey Rosa proves that it is possible to create a BIG novel in remarkably few words and do it on many levels at once, satisfying the reader on all levels. Life and death, love, and books. Who could ask for more? - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XJ1VH7R0QK29/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300196091&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Mary Whipple]

*****
This rare and exceedingly dotty little volume is subtitled "The Chronicles of the Surrealist Sportsman's Club". Maurice Richardson, a British journalist, had read one too many newspaper columns about sport. In reaction he created Engelbrecht: "a dwarf, of course, like nearly all surrealist boxers who do most of their fighting with clocks."

Fifteen sporting episodes explore suitably weird pastimes. The great Witch Shoot at Nightmare Abbey would be all too politically incorrect nowadays. A surrealist golf match around the world ("Par is reckoned at 818181") is enlivened by a most dubious hole-in-one. In the angling championship whose greatest prize is the giant pike that ate the Bishop of Ely in 1448, little Engelbrecht distinguishes himself brilliantly as the bait.

One particularly crazed cricket-match features a literal demon bowler (kept in a well-stoked furnace between overs), against whom Salvador Dali bats, unsuccessfully, with a chest of drawers. Earth's soccer game against Mars has a vast panhistorical team--"Some unlikely characters have scored, even Heliogabalus, Bishop Berkley and Aubrey Beardsley"--and the winning coup involves planting Engelbrecht as a hidden influence inside the ball. Surreal chess on a huge, literal battlefield echoes World War II; eventually a pawn promotes to Atom Bomb, and despite the enemy's immediate resignation insists on detonating. Remember Dark Star?

Engelbrecht's finest hour is his prolonged boxing bout against a ten-foot Grandfather Clock which deals viciously unsporting blows with its hands, weights, pendulum, and other dread accessories. After taking a fearful battering for nine rounds, our resourceful dwarf leaps into the clock's case and deftly halts the mechanism: "The crowd goes wild and the sun turns black and all over the place clocks stop and time stands still." Treasurable lunacy, to be taken in small doses. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cur0007.htm[David Langford]

*****
First published in Spain in 1983 and proclaimed “an instant postmodern classic, without a doubt the most disturbingly original Spanish prose of the century” (Encyclopedia Britannica 1985 Book of the Year), Larva is a rollicking account of a masquerade party in an abandoned mansion in London. Milalias (disguised as Don Juan) searches for Babelle (as Sleeping Beauty) though a linguistic fun house of polylingual puns and wordplay recalling Joyce’s Finnegans Wake. A mock-scholarly commentary reveals the backgrounds of the masked revelers, while Ríos’s punning and allusive language shows that words, too, wear masks, hiding an astonishing range of further meanings and implications. Larva‘s tale, a reassessment of the Don Juan myth in our time, is told in single-minded pursuit of double meanings, but it is serious play. It revives a Hispanic tradition repressed for centuries by introducing the Madhatter English tradition of puns, palindromes, and acrostics, by creating Joycean echoes and pushing language to its maximum connotative capacity. Larva has been praised by such leading Spanish-language writers as Carlos Fuentes, Juan Goytisolo, and Severo Sarduy, and establishes Ríos as the most accomplished successor to Joyce. - http://www.amazon.com/Larva-Midsummer-Nights-Julian-Rios/dp/091658366X/[Amazon boilerplate]

"Just as Ezra Pound wrote an "Homage to Sextus Propertius" to pay tribute to an important influence, Julian Rios offers in his novel an "Homage to Ezra Pound" (as the original Spanish edition is subtitled). On November 1, 1972, news of Pound's death in Venice reaches three Spanish bohemians in London, passionate admirers of "il miglior fabbro" ("the better craftsman," as Eliot called him), who decide to honor Pound's memory by visiting various sites in London associated with him.

Filled with allusions to Pound's life and works and written in a style similar to Finnegans Wake, Rios's word-mad novel features the same characters from his first novel "Larva" the poet Milalias, his girlfriend Babelle, and their mentor X. Reis, each of whom writes part of the novel: Milalias writes the Joycean main text, Reis (as Herr Narrator) adds commentary on facing pages, and Babelle furnishes maps and photos. Together, they compile the "Parting Shots" at the end, dazzling short stories that expand upon incidents in the main text. Sound confusing? No more so than "The Cantos," and Rios is much funnier." - https://www.amazon.com/Poundemonium-Spanish-Literature-Julian-Rios/dp/1564781380/[Amazon]

*****
"A leading Spanish postmodernist novelist paraphrases, summarizes, and cites James Joyce's modernist "mistresspiece," most-loved of all that Irishman's works. Ríos imagines a trio who meet to converse about Ulysses. The first is a mature reader, A; he is joined by a younger woman, B; third is an elderly critic, C. They gather in "The Ulysses Museum" and enter eighteen rooms as if in an academic library. Chaperoned by Professor Ludwig Jones, they wander through the book's eighteen dense chapters. They study under the tutelage of a silent guide, the `'man with the Mackintosh" whose computer projects overviews of the schemata used by Joyce in integrating Homeric correspondences into his tale of one day and night in the lives of three Dubliners and those whom they meet, dream of, contend with, and wonder about.

It offers an easy pace and conveys information with an affectionate tone. Nick Caistor's smooth translation reveals few quotable lines from Ríos in what for English-speakers becomes a tertiary source, but the structure of first a summation of each chapter's contents and then "passageways" that list a few observations made by the four (or one silent, five) observers in the Museum allows, in relatively few pages, a quick guided tour through its contents.

Especially for those fearful of more scholarly treatments of Ulysses, Ríos provides a neat compression of much academic insights, crammed into a small, portable, and accessible companion. Not only beginners may benefit with Ríos as a guide. Study of this novel, as I was warned in college, can happily consume one's spare time over a lifetime. In House, I learned a dozen fresh insights about the novel.

This book failed to rise or fall to parody. It's not as funny as the advance buzz makes it out to be, but it does introduce a hesitant reader to its mysteries, if in a more sober tone than I expected. While marketed as a send-up of the scholarship surrounding Joyce, it serves rather to document and transmit its findings efficiently. Ríos does adapt, as with "Aeolus," "Nausicaa," "Eumaeus," and "Penelope," the styles of the prose that Joyce celebrated and caricatured. Ríos's own take on the Joyce industry may be less "slapstick" than the promotional material promises; I found its delivery rather steady. As any critic of Joyce without a sense of humor has found the wrong text to explore over a lifetime, the offhand remarks made sporadically by Ríos's team of academically bent visitors were rather anodyne, on par with anyone who has lived and slept with, as one does, this text over any period of time.

Therefore, this fictional conceit fits better as a friendly, if a bit garrulous, companion. Any work that reminds us of the mastery and mystery of this modernist masterful "mistresspiece" succeeds in this measure. The essential function of The House of Ulysses is to direct our gaze away from its own pages. Holding a guidebook, we learn. Then we put it down, to look up (or down) again at its own inspiration. (P.S. See my reviews of David Pierce's "Reading Joyce" and Declan Kiberd's "Ulysses & Us" for two recent, if more academic, commentaries worth your while.)" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R307PJ437Z2JN6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564785971[John L Murphy]

[[I_the_Supreme]]
*I the Supreme* (2000)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Latin-American-Literature-Series/dp/1564782476/[Amazon]

*****
There are three great novels about the Latin American dictator and all of them are very different. Miguel Asturias' Mr. President deals with a backwater banana republic where the president for life's presence itself is minor. What occurs instead is the lethal working out of a hideously unjust system which crushes and destroys all who resist and those who are caught in its clutches. Then there is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, an example of high modernism at its most brilliant. In sentences of increasingly serpentine length (in the end consisting of the final chapter of forty-five pages) Garcia Marquez deals with an aged dictator who has ruled for centuries and is capable of every iniquity (such as serving up a cabinet minister for his treacherous colleagues to eat) while living in a world of pretend power and real submission (he has to sell his country's sea to pay off the Americans). This book is also high modernist, but is very different. Instead of the fantastic elements of the Autumn of the Patriarch we have here the story of the founder of Paraguay, Dr. Francia. Dr. Francia consolidated his country's independence by creating a regime of isolation and absolute power. He expelled the Jesuits and set up his own Catholic Church so it would not be beholden to Rome. He was utterly ruthless and the result, according to E. Bradford Burns was an autarky that probably benefited the masses more in terms of literacy and nutrition than any other Latin American country of the time. Its fate, however, was to be crushed by the surrounding countries in the great war of 1870-73 where the male population was almost literally devastated.

No venal tinpot hack, Dr. Francia appears as a man of frightening sincerity, in an account that is of direct revelance to the fate of Castro's Cuba. I, the Supreme begins with a proclamation in which the dicators calls for the decapitation of his corpse and the lynching of all his ministers. It continues with tales of prisoners forced to live in boats travelling down the rivers of Paraguay without ever stopping. We read of Francia's dialogue with a sycophantic Vicar General ("How long did the trial of the infamous traitors to the Fatherland last? As long as it was necessary in order not to rush to judgement. They were granted every right to defend themselves. In the end every recourse was exhausted. It might be said that the case was never closed. It is still open. Not all the guilty parties were sentenced to death and executed."), who then goes on to condemn his priests for siring dozens and hundreds of illegitimate children. Like Lenin and indeed Stalin he rants against the jungle of bureaucracy that he himself has created, he outsmarts the greedy surrounding oligarchies who wish to absorb Paraguay, he reminds his civil servants not to express and exploit the Indian population. We read reports of how school children are indoctrinated to see their great leader ("The Supreme Government is very old. Older than the Lord God, that our schoolmaster...tells us about in a low voice.) The book is a masterpiece of polyphony, filled with many voices and viewpoints, combined with a richness of metaphor and incident and a complexity of moral vision that have few competitors this century. Writing for a country that has possessed only brief and shadowy vestiges of liberty, Roa Bastos deals with its pain in a way that should be required reading for all who care about democracy. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FR74X3M4KB10/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564782476&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[pnotley@gmail.com]

The reader might wonder who on earth would want to know what goes on in the mind of a really horrible person, but everyone from police detectives to your average citizen ought to know how a dictator thinks, because--here's the surprise--there's a little bit of the Supreme One in all of us. For each of us, we are Supreme in our own lives; we would like our orders to be followed, or we would like to control everyone. The difference is that this dictator was given the power (by those at the top) and then used his power to either execute or imprison anyone who disagreed with him--and relatives were no exception. But, even after 25 years, the Supreme Dictator of Paraguay could not escape death; surely you'd think that the experience of one's own aging and mortality would humble some people, but not if you've made a deal with the devil, I suppose.

The artistry of this novel is that it's way beyond what Irish exile James Joyce or any other writer of a monumental tome could accomplish, and now I see why: the author Augusto Roa Bastos was a native-born Paraguayan who fled to Argentina from another of those dictators. As a man in exile, Roa Bastos had the knowledge to write as he did, basing his "character" of the dictator on actual historical documents. And now that I think of it, Stendhal was also fleeing from the Austrian occupation of northern Italy which threatened to arrest him. It seems that if you live in fear of a totalitarian regime, and you are literate, you can crank out a dynamic novel--even if a somewhat difficult one, as in Yo, El Supremo.

To quote at all from this novel would be to take words out of context since every phrase, every image, every sentence is connected to the one before and after--and the tone of voice binds the entire novel. The astonishing thing is that this dictator kind of snuck up on me; in the middle of a paragraph, I would suddenly think that this dictator makes sense, in fact, it would seem that for Dr. Francia, the real man on whom the novel is based, is quite rational. El Supremo makes it seem that some nations, while in their formative state, need dictatorship. Democracy would be bad for your people, if you think of your people as children, and they might be attacked by Argentina or Bolivia, for example. But it's still a mystery to me why, in certain periods of history, in certain places in the world, some nations have tyranny but others do not--or their leaders think that everything is going fine. But this novel is the most thorough, imaginative exploration of this topic that anyone is likely ever to read, and it puts a whole new spin on the topic of national security. I didn't think it possible, but because of this novel I am more aware of the use of language, the effects that a wide vocabulary can have on a person's ability to think--and, for the first time, I'm deeply aware of Paraguay.

This is not an easy summer read, but I guess the past two months it have been winter in the southern hemisphere. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILY5HSKPTQ9I/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564782476&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[T. M. Teale]

*****
"LIKE a conflation of Voltaire and Thorne Smith, this lively, witty, whimsical yet sardonic novel by the Spanish writer Antoniorrobles (Antonio J. Robles Soler, born 1895, died 1983) is the mythic yet earthy biography of Auro, a centaur born in the year 1930 in the Spanish village of Villacolorín. Taken by a passing German savant to Berlin, our involuntarily expatriated hero is motivated to reclaim his Iberian heritage and become a writer by meeting a visiting author—one Antoniorrobles! Falling in love with a beautiful exchange student, Encarnita Banzo, provides a spur to action also.

Setting out to cross the continent by hoof, Auro first visits the strange Ruritanian land of Pitolia, which proves to be a dangerous outpost of Moonmen. Escaping to Marseilles (en route, women of every social stratum seem inordinately fascinated by his equine portions), he eventually reaches Spain, and of course finds it no paradise, but a prejudiced place not inclined to accept chimeras into polite society. Living in a monastery, swept up in the Spanish Civil War, exiled to Africa, Auro ends up reuniting with Encarnita in Mexico (after visiting a mid-Atlantic realm of mermaids en route, and echoing Antoniorrobles's own migrations), but only tragedy awaits.

"Don Quixote and Rocinante in one," Auro maintains his purity for Encarnita until a temptation no male could resist. Eight voluptuous harem women have their way with him. "They kissed Auro's lips raw, they patted and rubbed his horse's buttocks…and finally they forced the centaur off his feet."

This book is definitely weird but I liked it. The first novella involves alien visitation and abduction and I am always a sucker for those kinds of stories. But there is a lot of strange numbers with interesting patterns in the first half as well and that is very unusual to see in fiction. I noticed there isn't a book description listed above but I found one on another site and thought I would post it.

The alien returns every night attempting to give Tyrone a special gift. But he doesn't want it. Then the numbers begin. They go on and on and never seem to end. Will Tyrone ever accept the alien's gift? And could the multitude of numbers be signaling the end of the world?

life.exe by JASON ROGERS. What if 'people' really did live in a matrices dominated existence?

The second novella in the book, the part by Mr. Rogers, was a lot different than the first novella. The story seems to be set in a class room and the characters are long binary numbers. It was kind of confusing but sort of okay overall with a good quote by Beckett at the end which summed up everything nicely. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EF8M43NQ79FB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1847280714&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[machguitar9]

"In her Translator's Foreword, Edith Grossman compares this novel to Pirandello's "Six Characters" and Unamuno's "Mist." She might also have mentioned Flann O'Brien's "At Swim-Two-Birds." But actually this novel is incomparable, except perhaps to some Cubist masterpiece. By the end one feels, not just that one has seen Federico Garcia Lorca from every possible or impossible vantage point, but that one has inhabited him and his times. This novel is neither "moving" in any familiar, predictable way, nor is it what people call "cold" or "purely intellectual"; I'm simply sure, having just finished it, that it will still haunt me months and years from now. I don't know Spanish, but Ms. Grossman's translation reads effortlessly.

http://seraillon.blogspot.com/2013/06/an-infinite-book-grande-sertao-veredas.html[Seraillon]

*****
The "sertão" of the title designates the outback, the backlands, the bush. In the book it is the hinterland which is east-central Brazil ("veredas" are the palm-lined streams that bubble up from the wetter part of this region); more generally it is a mythic land where neither "king nor law" ("sem rei nem lei") curtail liberty. It is the territory of the "jagunços": mounted mercenaries in the pay of landowners or politicians, or just plain bandits, that roamed the sertão in the decades before and after the beginning of the last century.

In Guimarães Rosa's book, Riobaldo, a retired and aging jagunço chief with some education, relates his unsettled, violent and anguished life to an unidentified "doutor", a man of education and social standing we can suppose is the author. The book's great triumph is to convince the reader that he is not only seeing the world though Riobaldo's eyes but also accompanying the jagunço's often agonized thought processes. The key to this success is twofold. On the one hand, Rosa uses for Riobaldo's narration a rich dialect of Portuguese purporting to be that spoken by inhabitants of the sertão. (It is not clear to the average Brazilian reader to what extent this dialect is invented or not!) On the other, Rosa's descriptions of people, events and places are so meticulous and idiosyncratic that it is difficult to imagine that they are wholly fictional. One is forced to wonder to what extent the story was made up by the author and to what extent it is a record of actual events related by a participant. The truth, presumably, is that it is a mixture of the two.

Besides dealing with warring factions of jagunços, motivated by support for regional political leaders, exploitation of the sertão's inhabitants, group loyalty and, ultimately, a desire for vengeance, the book is the story of Riobaldo's complex platonic love affair with his childhood friend and comrade-in-arms Reinaldo/Diadorim.

With its idealization of untamed rugged backlands, its portrayal of a rigid, violent anti-authoritarian sub-culture, its central theme of a transgressive love affair, and its obsession with the wiles of the Devil, "Grande Sertão" is Brazilian to the core. Although a reader requires a very good knowledge of Brazilian Portuguese to read it in the original, the book is justifiably a classic. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DZJR18ROG74M/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9997555449[Roger John Maudsley]

*****
"Intriguing novel I came across by accident, Roussel's 'Impressions of Africa' is a fantastical tale showing an authorial imagination unbridled. It mixes ancient fables from around the world with amazing spectacles, performances, inventions and machines. Written in the early part of the twentieth century, there is an underlying theme of European culture versus 'the other', in this case a race/tribe indigenous to Africa, for whom the European hereditary gene, style, ideas and modes of dress are seen as superior and desirable. There is intrigue, revenge, adultery and betrayal which frames an elaborate interaction between shipwrecked Europeans and their African captors in a clever, non-linear timeframe. This narrative, however, takes second place to the overwhelming reader experience of fast-changing visual and musical sensations. The book shows interest in icons and their representative values, and it further touches on relationships between communal/historical artefacts and their display. There is some experimentation in intertextuality, most notably Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'. I have since learnt that Roussel took a semi-formulaic approach to prose writing based on extended homonymic punning which in retrospect is revealed in a slightly mechanical textual rhythm which I had rather dismissed as the style of a different time coupled with the French to English translation. Certainly an extremely imaginative piece and a curio of French literature." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YP9LYS80RFR6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564786242[Stephen Connolly]

I've read nothing quite like this. I went into the book knowing as little as possible, and what little detail I accidentally saw in summaries revealed only the tiniest fraction of the whole. I'm glad to have been surprised by all inside.

The style can be very, very dense, containing incredible detail regarding each of Canterel's discoveries and creations. At first, for that reason, I thought my excitement had been unfounded, that all the detail would prove too tiresome to endure. After little time at all, however, I found myself loath to stop reading it, even for food or sleep. It can seem dry on the surface, but just beneath is a most mind-bending world.

There's more to Locus Solus than inventions and oddities. There are compelling stories behind them, some of them strange and disturbing, others just delightfully surreal, and some are plenty of both. There are original mythologies resembling fairy tales, stories within stories, and characters within them that range from the intentionally two-dimensional (as in fairy tales) to the complex, and all are utterly original.

This book would still be remarkable coming from a modern author, but that it was written in the early 1900s somehow impresses me even more. Often when reading I found myself making happily bewildered faces, because this book is truly 'out there'.

If you're aching to stray from the well-worn path of predictable, formulaic fantasies, this could be well worth your time. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWVLWWQ930JB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1847492738&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ricky H.]

http://www.amazon.com/Pedro-Paramo-Juan-Rulfo/dp/0802133908/[Amazon]

*****
Nothing in literature can prepare you for the impact of Pedro Paramo for nothing in literature compares to this novel from Mexican author Juan Rulfo. Published in 1955, and Rulfo's only novel, Pedro Paramo is the story of Juan Preciado's quest to find both his roots and his father. Fulfilling his mother's dying wish, Juan sets out for the rural Mexican village of Comala, the village of his mother's memories, the village where "she sighed about going back," and where Pedro Paramo, lover, overlord and murderer, spent his childhood and his youth. What Juan finds in Comala is something very different from what he expected, something very different from what the reader expects, for Comala is truly a village of the damned, a hell that one literally descends into, never to return. As Juan Preciado meets first one, then another of the inhabitants of Comala, he comes to an astonishing revelation--everyone in Comala, including his father, is dead. The second half of Pedro Paramo concerns itself with the reasons why Comala became a village of the dead and the emphasis then shifts to the enigmatic character of Susana San Juan, the only woman Pedro Pramo ever truly loved and the one who was forever denied him. Although few details are provided about Susana San Juan, we come to see her as the epitome of two archetypes: the heavenly goddess and the overtly sexual madwoman. When she dies and ascends into heaven, in front of Pedro Paramo's own eyes, the fate of Comala and its residents becomes forever sealed. Although this small book may seem to lack structure (there are no chapter breaks), it is highly structured. It is, however, a structure of silences, hanging threads, truncated scenes, and even non-time. Rulfo moves backwards and forewards between the past (the Comala of the living) and the present (the Comala of the dead). The author moves seamlessly between first person and third person; scenes cut into one another and move effortlessly from one location to another and yet nothing is jarring, nothing is out of place. Although more horrifying than any other book I have ever read, Pedro Paramo does not "fit" into any genre and Rulfo uses none of the usual writer's techniques to enhance his story. Rulfo simply uses straightforward narration, moving from conscious thought to memory, from the world of the living to the world of the dead. In an interview in 1980, Rulfo, himself, said that he wanted to allow the reader to participate in the telling of the story, in the filling in of the blanks. Pedro Paramo is a shadowy, eerie, haunting work, and one whose impact on literature cannot be over-emphasized. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has called this book the most influential reading of his early writing years and has admitted to memorizing the entire text. Yet Pedro Paramo completely lacks the humor of Garcia Marquez (in fact, its bleakness is entirely unrelieved) and it is definitely not magical realism. Although this book defies classification, it is most definitely a masterpiece and most definitely one-of-a kind. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARM0J3WZ7XGS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802133908&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

"'Salaam alaikum, sat sri akaal, namaste ji, good evening oan this hoat, hoat summer's night. Fae the peaks ae Kirkintilloch tae the dips ae Cambuslang, fae the invisible mines ae Easterhoose tae the mudflats ae Clydebank, welcome, ivirywan, welcome, Glasgow, welcome, Scotland, tae The Junnune Show.' Suhayl Saadi's debut novel demands attention from its first page onwards, as much by the sounds it conjures as by its story. This is a novel of linguistic fireworks: DJ Zaf addresses his invisible audience in a unique Scots-Urdu patter, with a dash of Gaelic and French thrown in for good measure.

Tonight is the last broadcast of Radio Chandhi, a temporary radio station based in a disused church, and Zaf ignores all requests, choosing instead a very different playlist on his final graveyard shift. He presents the soundtrack of his life, from the Pakistani ballads of his parents' youth to the Asian and Western rock songs of his adolescence. Zaf's memories come as thick and fast as the tracks, and reality and the surreal ('Junnune' means a trance-like state) dissolve as he recalls the daring escape by his parents from Lahore to Britain, his own destructive entanglement with Zilla who descends into heroin addiction and his relationship with Babs, the blonde nurse who in his mind epitomises whiteness.

This is a story of shifting identity, of hopes and disappointments, passion and separation, and a sense of simmering racial tensions threatening to break into violence on the streets of Glasgow. Psychoraag is nothing if not ambitious in its scope: from his radio booth, Zaf's monologue ranges over generations, continents and cultures. At times the sheer energy of the novel becomes almost manic. Saadi has written one of the most original and powerful novels to come out of Scotland for years." - https://www.list.co.uk/article/2802-suhayl-saadi-psychoraag-2004/[Laura Marney]

"Ed Sanders' "Shards Of God" is not an easy novel to review by any means. Totally of its time, it's redolent with views and sentiments which were probably outdated the day it was published; no wonder it's long, long out of print. In some ways the novel is the funhouse mirror reflection of Anita Hoffman's psuedo-autobiography "Trashing" (published by Rolling Stone's imprint Straight Arrow in 1970 under the psuedonym "Ann Fettamen;" see my review here on Amazon for more info). Like that novel, "Shards Of God" features actual Yippies in main roles, particularly Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Paul Krassner. But whereas "Trashing" mostly stuck to real-life escapades, "Shards Of God" is a modern myth, a fantastical fable of drugged-out depravity.

Sanders relates the shenanigans of himself and his fellow hippies in a "living myth" fashion, with Egyptian gods even taking part. Sanders, Hoffman, Krassner et al are larger-than-life characters, more demigods than actual mortals, and each act is blossomed into some mytho-poetic fantasy of absurd degree. One need look no further than "Shards Of God" to see where modern-day analogues like Mark Leyner got 98% of their schtick.

The novel proceeds in episodic fashion; each chapter works as a self-contained short story. Real-life characters like Hoffman and Rubin interract with characters like Quick Kill Merle, Aunt No No, and She-Who-Sucks-in-a-Skirt-of-Snakes. We are treated to phantasmorphic recreations of real-life incidents such as the "Pentagon Exorcism," as well as inside looks into how one was "initiated" into the Yippies (a charnel-house sequence which most likely had William Burroughs either red with envy or red with outrage over such gross missappropriation of his writing style).

Sanders writes with a flair and verve which quickens the reader's pulse. Coupled with his obvious familiarity with ancient myth, this makes for a one-of-a-kind reading experience. The only question is, who today would want to read this? Sanders opens the novel with a preface which states that the Yippie revolution will be successful, changing the entire world. I don't need to tell you that this never happened. Like "Trashing," I have a feeling "Shards Of God" was already behind the times upon its publication in 1970. That Sanders is so beligerent throughout that he is a harbinger of a future reality only heightens its charm and obscurity; I checked the book out from the library, and, according to its checkout slip, the last time someone else had done so was March, 1982.

So, if you are looking for a fantastical view of the 1960s complete with walk-ons from Isis, Pharoah Akhnaton, the spirit of Che, a sexually-augmented Abbie Hoffman, and "Penthouse Letters"-type porn aplenty, then look no further than Ed Sanders' long out-of-print "Shards Of God." It's so William Burroughs you'll think it's "Naked Lunch, Part 2." And it's so of its time that Rolling Stone Magazine even gave it a glowing review in an early issue; these days, if Rolling Stone even bothered to mention it, it would of course be in an unflattering light." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RNKRW5QPT2EJ/[Joe Kenney]

[[Cain]]
*Cain* (2012)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547840179/[Amazon]

*****
This tour de force has got to be the most radically different kind of book since the creation of Finnegans Wake by James Joyce (most likely a brother in spirit). This work, though, is more readable despite its encompassing stylistic forays into the no-no's of grammar and punctuation. What I'm saying is "Hold onto your hats, you've never read anything like it."

cain is the protagonist (and I purposely do not capitalize his name as no names are capitalized in the world of Jose Saramago, at least not in this story) and it is to be remembered that cain's extraordinary journey through the world of the Old Testament is pre-Biblical. He has no points of reference (no footnotes, no exegeses, no internet commentaries) but his own direct reactive experiences to the events he witnesses by some mysterious decree (even God is puzzled by its source).

And what events he witnesses (and even plays a main role in some of them)! After killing his brother, something which he never ceases to regret, God sentences him to wander the earth (a la the ocean's Flying Dutchman, but without any seven years' chance of redemption, however slim), and in his peregrinations he meets up with no less than Abraham, Joshua, Noah and witnesses the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, among other catastrophic events. Let's face it. He doesn't think much of God, and doesn't mind telling him so. God's opinion of cain is mutual. The unresolvedness of this shared state is at the heart of this story. And their differences of opinion perpetuate to this day.

Certainly the fact that Saramago was an atheist and a libertarian communist colored his weltanschauung. When the Portuguese government censored his book The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, he relocated from his native country to the Canary Islands. Neither did he win a popularity contest with the Catholic Church.

Stylistically, the innovations in this book include paragraphs some running for many pages, commas to divide sentences, rather than periods, a new speaker denoted only by an initial capital letter of a word, names, as I mentioned, are not capitalized, yet some words, such as Mother and Father, are capitalized. At first it seems a bit puzzling, but as one reads on it becomes a flow of sorts, an interior drifting that eventually becomes appealing. I believe that because of these innovations, an intensity is sustained because of the scarcity of breaks (halts) in the narrative.

So here we've got a book by a genius, no doubt. As an allegory, I miss the well-rounded human, and yet reading it is kind of like getting a sock in the teeth. "Take that!" says Saramago.

With pleasure, replies the reader. At least this one. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R26AVNFEZBPL4K/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547840179&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Elaine Campbell]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
Sarban presents us with a vision that is both uncompromising and visceral. Unlike a large majority of less potent works, he does not deign to rationalize or explain the groundings of his tale. Like a unicorn grazing in a pasture, it simply exists, unable to be denied. This tale has a logic all its own and as Sarban says, Querdilion is not only an outlaw from man's laws (the laws created by the Nazi Germany he is trapped in), he is also an outlaw from the laws of Nature. As such, no reason should be given for his transportation to and from this nightmare realm. To give a reason would be contradicting Sarban's initial premise that Querdillon is an outlaw of Nature's laws for reason is a law which Nature follows. It is not a law of Hackelnberg. Madness is. Human beings stripped of all that can be called human, reduced to the most animalistic state imaginable captures this madness beautifully and Sarban's most powerful prose centers on this theme. Yet. There is another law, perhaps one that cuts across reality, which gives this tale its unique power and mystery. Kit and Alan. Trapped in a nightmare, somehow they manage to find a love that is pure and pristine, untouched by the Count, untouched even by death. As the Count stares across the Bohlen ray fence at Alan at the end of the novel, one has the sense that there are some laws which are beyond man, some powers which are beyond the control of even the most brutal potentate. Love is definitely a necessary part of this power, but to say that love is this power would perhaps oversimplify Sarban's complex and achingly beautiful tale. No, it is something else, something ineffable, that same something which transported Alan to Hackelenberg and back to WWII Nazi Germany. Something that haunts him even as he tells the tale. Something that touches him to the core as he says that he "learned for the first time how such a loss uproots all other agonies from the soul and makes of the heart a desert where fear and pain can never grow again." And it is that something, that force which draws the reader time and again to this beautiful, mysterious piece of prose. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NUFH72JOW1S4/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627553614[Anthony Rodriguez]

[[The_Hieros_Gamos]]
*The Hieros Gamos of Sam and An Smith* (1969)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0207197075/[Amazon]

*****
This first novel by Josephine Saxton may have been published as science fiction, but it's as far from spaceships & rayguns & robots as you can get. One of the most fascinating & sadly neglected of the New Wave SF writers who flourished briefly in the late 1960s, her work is avant-garde & has more in common with Surrealist writers such as Leonora Carrington. Even in those heady days of experimentation & shattering genre boundaries, this was uncommon work.

Yet the narrative is simple, straightforward, matter-of-fact, and written with an utter clarity & attention to everyday detail. It has a certain dreamlike quality, in that it makes perfect emotional sense ... unless you start thinking too much about certain logical inconsistencies. Given the SF label, you'll start wondering what's going on behind the scenes: manipulation of reality? some strange scientific study? alien intervention? a post-apocalyptic scenario?

Let me warn you right now -- while the final pages transition seamlessly into the (then) modern world, there's no scientific explanation, no deus ex machina to resolve everything. Nobody appears to tell us reassuringly, "Here's what happened & why." But there doesn't have to be that sort of explanation, because it makes sense at a very deep & primal level.

So let's look at the actual story ...

The nameless boy is 14. He's been walking through a wasteland by himself since he was 4. He's seen a bird once, maybe twice in all those years. Yet he always wears clean, fashionable clothes & thinks in an educated manner, even though many things familiar to the reader are utterly foreign to him.

From time to time, he passes through empty towns. Nobody has been there in years. Yet the food in the stores is always fresh, the coffee makers still work, the water still runs. He takes all this for granted. When he does talk to himself, it's in a rather formal manner:

"'This is very annoying. I must remember that this door is not personally attempting to frustrate me,' he said, and walked away backwards from the unhelpful door."

His life changes when he stumbles across a dead woman who has just given birth to a baby girl. Despite his own fear & revulsion, he takes the baby with him. The reader might expect some grim, hardscrabble struggle for brute survival ... but that's not the case. The boy simply finds another town & raises the baby there for a few years, living in the Universal Goods Store, Ltd.

As the two grow older, there are occasional brief appearances by strangers in the distance. The two often wake to find telegrams of encouragement left at their bedsides. And they gradually become aware of their own budding sexuality.

At this point, let's remember that the Hieros Gamos of the title means "sacred marriage." It's both a mythological & psychological term. Let's also remember that one of the primary themes of New Wave SF was inner space, as opposed to outer space. This provides us with the necessary reading of this wondrous novel, which presents the universal journey of the human being, so familiar to everyone, and makes it new, giving it an unearthly beauty & power.

I've searched the internet for information about the author, but there's a dearth of it. All of her books seem to be out of print, and almost none of them have online reviews. This is a shame, because she's a superb writer, one who has the rare gift of both unsettling & enlightening the reader. When I began reading this novel, I had no idea where it was going -- but I couldn't put it down. And when I finished the last page, I simply sat in silence for awhile, mulling it over, knowing that I'd be reading it again before long.

"Not for every taste" is often used for unorthodox works of art, but it especially applies here. In these more literal times, where inner space is the last place anyone wants to go, I can't imagine much of an audience for such a novel. Again, that's a shame. It's truly stunning work, sure to appeal to the adventurous reader -- those of Surrealist tastes in particular. Definitely & desperately in need of reprinting!

As for me, I've already ordered more of her work & can't wait to read it. Meanwhile, I've scanned in the author's picture from the book jacket, which you can find elsewhere on this page (see all 2 customer images). It captures the tone of those times perfectly: hairstyle, clothing, cigarette, all radiating style, smarts, cool & confidence to spare. An extraordinary talent, one I'm so happy to have discovered at last! - http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTW5Y4KFA4I5/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0207197075&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[William Timothy Lukeman]

Scarron's classic, "The Comic Romance," should not be missed. I laughed out loud repeatedly; but it's more than just a delight. This picaresque novel makes life in 17th century France come alive. It's hard to believe that this is the first English translation in over 300 years! Jacques Houis' rendering is superb, never drawing attention to itself. His "extra material" (included as an afterward) is one of the best introductions to a work of literature I've read in a long time -- I would probably not be the only one to appreciate having read it before delving into the novel itself. Congratulations to Alma Classics for bringing this literary masterpiece back to life for English readers. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKL1DW1W1BZI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1847492207&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Presbyrev]

*****
First published in German in 1913 and widely considered to be Paul Scheerbart's masterpiece, Lesabéndio is an intergalactic utopian novel that describes life on the planetoid Pallas, where rubbery suction-footed life forms with telescopic eyes smoke bubble-weed in mushroom meadows under violet skies and green stars. Amid the conveyor-belt highways and lighthouses weaving together the mountains and valleys, a visionary named Lesabéndio hatches a plan to build a 44-mile-high tower and employ architecture to connect the two halves of their double star. A cosmic ecological fable, Scheerbart's novel was admired by such architects as Bruno Taut and Walter Gropius, and such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem (whose wedding present to Benjamin was a copy of Lesabéndio). Benjamin had intended to devote the concluding section of his lost manuscript "The True Politician" with a discussion of the positive political possibilities embedded in Scheerbart's "Asteroid Novel." As translator Christina Svendsen writes in her introduction, "Lesabéndio helps us imagine an ecological politics more daring than the conservative politics of preservation, even as it reminds us that we are part of a larger galactic set of interrelationships." This volume includes Alfred Kubin's illustrations from the original German edition. - http://www.amazon.com/Lesab%C3%A9ndio-Asteroid-Novel-Paul-Scheerbart/dp/0984115595/[Amazon boilerplate]

This is one of Schmidt's "superbooks," a large format novel with unusual page layouts, illustrations, and puns a'plenty. Nowhere near as difficult as Zettel's Traum or Evening Edged in Gold, it's a rollicking tale of culture-clash set in the near future (with an extended flashback to 1969), and features a typical Schmidt protagonist (a walking encyclopedia of an old codger), two delightful 17-year-old girls, a visiting American Secretary of State nicknamed Isis, and many more. If you've read & like Schmidt, you'll love this (once again heroically translated by the amazing John E. Woods). And if you don't know Schmidt, you don't know one of the greatest writers of the 20th century--which means you have some catching up to do, and may as well start here. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CA0IF7MVENS6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1892295962&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Steven Moore]

[[Bottoms_Dream]]
*Bottom's Dream* (1970, 2016)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
So this monster arrives as the Dalkey Archive book to end all Dalkey Archive books. The invaluable independent Dalkey Press has long been known for publishing monstrous and difficult tomes of literature like Miss Macintosh, My Darling, Vol. 1 (Volume 1) and Women and Men (could we get a reprint on this one please?), but this has got to be *the* echt-Dalkey book, 1500 pages containing over a million words in heavily-addled typography, set in anywhere from two to four columns that poke and intrude upon each other.

For all that, it's not as difficult as your typical Dalkey offering, and far easier than Finnegans Wake, which Schmidt at one time intended to translate, and which looms very large as an influence here. Despite the constant puns and wacky punctuation, the language is in relatively clear English, and the overall structure is a lot more easily grasped. A married couple, both translators, go to visit a Poe scholar, there begins a very, very digressive evening on the nature of literature, language, love, meaning, and the like. The couple's teenage daughter is there too, nursing a huge crush on the Poe scholar. (Yes, you may find Schmidt a tad regressive in his gender attitudes.)

I've only made it through the first of the eight chapters, but I gather that Schmidt sticks more or less with the program for the entire book. The program appears to be constant literary allusions, direct references, quotes, and analyses, all tied together and mutilated with a Joycean sense of punning. Unlike with Joyce, Schmidt's agenda is focused more narrowly on literature, leaving aside myth and history. While Finnegans Wake very explicitly claimed the mantle of all of human history, Schmidt is after a sort of shared linguistic unconscious, where "etyms" form a deep structure of language that guides how we interpret reality. The resemblance could be pure coincidence, but the dual structure is uncannily reminiscent of Chomsky's universal grammar in form, though not in content. These are the reference points to which I kept returning:

SUBJECT MATTER: Poe

PRESENTATION: Joyce

MEANING: Freud

THEORY: Chomsky

I don't claim to have any grasp of the motivic movement of the book, so I cannot assemble the allusions to Jean Paul, Goethe, Hoffmann, and thousands of others into a whole beyond the explicit "etym" theory. And I suspect a lot of people won't see Chomsky in it. But that's one of the main communal purposes of a book like this: you can read what you wish into it and people can't just wave you away and say, "That's ridiculous."

Because Schmidt leans heavily on Freud (it's a book about a dream, after all) for The Meaning Of It All, Schmidt's account of deep structure is overwhelmingly sexual, and so dirty puns abound. And not just puns; Schmidt has his own dirty emoticon language, as with this punctuational depiction of sexual intercourse:

-.---. / --: "?" - "." /-: "? ?" -- ". . ." - / : ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Schmidt was a working-class autodidact who never went to university, and he shared with Joyce the paradox of relying on high culture for an audience while disdaining it for its narrow-minded snobbery and superficial intellect. Both Joyce and Schmidt loved high art and trash alike. Schmidt translated James Fenimore Cooper, Stanley Ellin, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton (yes, THAT Bulwer-Lytton) into German. And both Joyce and Schmidt happened on roughly the same solution to their alienation from high culture: write long and tricky books which it is near-impossible to speak authoritatively about. That's how you dethrone the literati.

As far as I can tell, Schmidt did not intend Bottom's Dream to be his greatest work, just his biggest. He did not devote the majority of his life to it, unlike Robert Musil with The Man Without Qualities or Uwe Johnson with his magnificent, forthcoming-in-translation Anniversaries. The afterword (by Schmidt's long-time and indefatigable translator John E. Woods, who also typeset this thing) even remarks that Schmidt suggested readers stick to chapters 1, 4, and 7, advice which I may yet take. It's hard for me to say that readers would be better served by starting here than Nobodaddy's Children: Scenes from the Life of a Faun, Brand's Heath, Dark Mirrors (Collected Early Fiction, 1949-1964 / Arno Schmidt) or the currently unavailable School for Atheists (Green Integer: EL-E-PHANT 53). Hell, I would also recommend that Americans in particular read more Edgar Allen Poe before tackling Schmidt, since the background will be useful and because Poe is a vastly more important author whose influence is hidden in subsequent works high and low alike. Thomas Disch called Poe "our embarrassing ancestor," which is exactly what makes him suitable for Schmidt's Freudian take on the unconscious history of literature. Poe is the sort of author and influence a writer will tend to repress out of his or her mind. Poe's erudite violence, filth, and rage make him the perfect raw material for Schmidt's comparatively genteel book. Also, "po" is German slang for "buttocks," as Woods pointed out in an interview.

That leaves this book's attraction for many as a literary fetish object, a handsomely produced yet ungainly monster of indisputable erudition yet highly selective appeal. Schmidt has his followers, yet in a time when literature is desperately striving for social relevance, Schmidt's work stands proud and naked as a work of literature first and cultural politics second, though Schmidt's crabbed leftist elitism is hardly buried. In contrast, the work of Marianne Fritz, which plays far crazier typographical games than Schmidt's, puts those tools to far more explicitly socio-political ends in the portrayal of suffering and oppression. Schmidt may regain ground once the pivot swings back away from politics and back toward the sort of Barthian "everything is a story" hijinks that were popular in the 70s and 80s. For now, this is one seriously unfashionable book. The question in my mind as I read it is whether all the jokes and play will reconnect in some profound way to the living world, or whether they will become a hermetically sealed world of their own, aesthetically stunning but unable to move the human heart. The jury's still out for me, but at the moment this enormous book still *feels* smaller than Finnegans Wake or Gravity's Rainbow.

In sum? An easy five stars for effort and intellect, but by its very nature a mixed bag. I recommend it, but only to those who have read this review and already find themselves interested. It is a book you come to*, not vice versa. Regardless, full plaudits to Woods and to Dalkey for their pursuit of the literary and the obscure in a time of increasing indifference and cultural illiteracy.

*Pun not intended, but I'm sure Schmidt would be delighted. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDYVG8D4GQY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628971592&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[David Auerbach]

JOHN AND Mary are affectionate newlyweds who want to swap genders. They visit Doctor Transit, a dwarf who has perfected a series of sex-change injections. The transition from female to male is rapid and exhilarating; the change from male to female takes longer and has a calming effect.

John becomes Joan, and Mary becomes Marlowe. The turnabout spouses remain married and in love; their new gonads function so well that Marlowe impregnates Joan. They decide that their forthcoming child will be male; if it's a girl, they'll ask Dr. Transit to correct the oversight. But after giving birth, Joan is homesick for her previous gender. Dr. Transit transforms Joan into an entirely new male named Jeremiah. Marlowe and the child discreetly fade out of the narrative.

Dr. Transit is murdered by a woman: apparently a genuine female, not one of his male clients. Jeremiah attempts to commit rape, then compiles a list of items that "in the absence of woman herself …fulfill the place of woman." Heading the list is "a square of paper." Jeremiah concludes that the perfect emblem of womanhood—"because of its headlong monotony of motion, in endless self-pursuit"—is the swastika.

This deeply misogynist transgender novel of 1925 discusses sexuality so frankly that the author was identified solely by initials. "I. S." was in fact Isidor Schneider (1896–1977), a Russian émigré who was active in the U.S. communist party, befriended the Hollywood Ten, and served in the Spanish Civil War. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2006/cur0609.htm[F.

"Imaginary Lives remains, over 120 years since its original publication in French, one of the secret keys to modern literature: under-recognized, yet a decisive influence on such writers as Apollinaire, Borges, Jarry and Artaud, and more contemporary authors such as Roberto Bolaño and Jean Echenoz. Drawing from historical influences such as Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius, and authors more contemporary to him such as Thomas De Quincey and Walter Pater, Schwob established the genre of fictional biography with this collection: a form of narrative that championed the specificity of the individual over the generality of history, and the memorable detail of a vice over the forgettable banality of a virtue.

These 22 portraits present figures drawn from the margins of history, from Empedocles the “Supposed God” and Clodia the “Licentious Matron” to the pirate Captain Kidd and the Scottish murderers Messrs. Burke and Hare. In his quest for unique lives, Schwob also formulated an early conception of the anti-hero, and discarded historical figures in favor of their shadows. These “imaginary lives” thus acquaint us with the “Hateful Poet” Cecco Angiolieri instead of his lifelong rival, Dante Alighieri; the would-be romantic pirate Major Stede Bonnet instead of the infamous Blackbeard who would lead him to the gallows; the false confessor Nicolas Loyseleur rather than Joan of Arc whom he cruelly deceived; or the actor Gabriel Spenser in place of the better-remembered Ben Jonson who ran a sword through his lung." - https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-Lives-Marcel-Schwob/dp/1939663342/[Amazon]

*****
"Marcel Schwob’s 1896 novella The Children’s Crusade retells the medieval legend of the exodus of some 30,000 children from all countries to the Holy Land, who traveled to the shores of the sea, which―instead of parting to allow them to march on to Jerusalem―instead delivered them to merchants who sold them into slavery in Tunisia or delivered them to a watery death. It is a cruel and sorrowful story mingling history and legend, which Schwob recounts through the voices of eight different protagonists: a goliard, a leper, Pope Innocent III, a cleric, a qalandar and Pope Gregory IX, as well as two of the marching children, whose naive faith eventually turns into growing fear and anguish.

Though it is a tale drawn from the early 13th century, Schwob presents it through a modern framework of shifting subjectivity and fragmented coherency, and its subject matter and its succession of different narrative perspectives has been seen as an influence on and precursor to such diverse works as Alfred Jarry’s The Other Alcestis, Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s “In a Grove,” William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying and Jerzy Andrzejewski’s The Gates of Paradise. It is a tale told by many yet understood by few, a mosaic surrounding a void, describing a world in which innocence must perish." - https://www.amazon.com/Childrens-Crusade-Marcel-Schwob/dp/1939663350/[Amazon]

"A rambunctious 60s novel straight out of Tristram Shandy (Laurence Sterne, like Scott, was a Yorkshireman.) But the influences don’t stop there. Throw in Tom Jones, Rabelais and Smollett and that’s just the older novelists. Scott also makes numerous references to contemporary novelists, even bringing in characters from other writers’ novels. The list is too long but let’s just mention some of the main ones – Mailer, Beckett, Purdy, Barth – indeed, some of the fun in reading this novel is spotting the references.

Scott has written a 1960s picaresque novel. It is full of linguistic, literary and other games. You will soon lose clear track of what is going on but that, indeed, is the point. It starts with the birth of Bartleby. He is the son of a Duchess and a philosophy student, neither of whom want anything to do with him. He is left with “Aunt” Alice (she is not, of course, his real aunt). And it is she that brings him up. Or rather she does initially, though the upbringing seems to consist mainly of extremely precocious sexual activity, starting with his suckling of her ample breasts and then moving on down. However, when he is five, the State moves him to an orphanage where his sexual education continues, even having his way with the stern and virginal matron. But eventually he decides he must leave and sets off to find Aunt Alice and her welcoming breasts.

While the rest of the novel is seemingly Bartleby’s adventures in search of Alice, the novel soon gets off track. Firstly, there is the role and identity of the author. This is a novel where the author is very much involved in the action. Indeed, very soon several of the characters are laying claim to be the author – Wordkyn the Poet and Wordkyn the Novelist (who may or may not be the same person), the hermit De’Ath, the dwarf Me, God and others. Some of them may be the same as the others. Some of them, however, may have multiple variations. The narrator also gets embroiled in this mess. Add to the fact that this author, whoever he may be, starts messing about with the chapter order, causing all sorts of problems for the characters, and you can see that this novel is fun. Add in literary games, language games, formatting games and the plot soon gets lost in all of this. Does Bartleby find Aunt Alice and her welcoming breasts? The answer is possibly but not before he has problems with the inhabitants of Throckton and their Machine, the hermit, the author (s), the narrator, various characters from others writers’ works, Damon Gottesgabe and other German-named persons, Bercilak de Belamoris and God knows who else. It’s all wonderful fun, wonderfully Sixties, wonderfully post-modern and a great read. Pity it’s out of print."

"Remember British defector-spies Burgess, Maclean, and Philby? In this coolly styled but self-defeatingly complex espionagerie, Scott posits yet another defector--George Michael Stevens, who may or may not have been Philby's successor. . . Or Philby's controller. . . or the link to Philby's recruiter. . . or maybe a secret agent for Britain all along, even now. In any case, Stevens is reported dead in Moscow, but Intelligence knows better and enlists journalist Bill Johnson (who has been doing a story on Stevens) to go to Russia and liaison with hospitalized Stevens and with some strangely cooperative, even seductive, KGB types. The theories and counter-theories that develop during Johnson's sojourn hinge on Stevens' code-laden memoirs (did he betray a whole network of agents?), on narcohypnoanalysis (is Stevens subconsciously resisting Soviet hypnosis because he's been programmed as a sleeper assassin by British hypnosis?), and on the continuing internal feuding at both British and Soviet spy headquarters. Despite a few bursts of action, this is taxingly pseudo-cerebral stuff, leavened by graceful literary allusions and pointed details but lacking the emotional core that most readers would depend on to see them through to a long-overdue Le Carre-ish denouement."

http://www.amazon.com/Passing-Human-Benaroya-Chronicles-Scott-ebook/dp/B0143K2LXG/[Amazon]

*****
A ploy older than Gulliver although Swift made the approach an adjective: protagonist comes to alien world whose natives and absurdities are of course not at all "alien" but refractive of the human condition. The tilt of alien perspective however enables the insanity, of that condition, perceived by a faux-naif to be the more clearly perceived.

Scott's Benaroya, researching, takes on the body of an attractive Terran female---wildly attractive, I should say, much of the plot keys on responses to "her" breasts---and explores 1970's California. Aren't these humans quaint! They actually believe that accumulation of these silly goods differentiates them! They want to hurt one another! They are obsessed by procreation, so cunningly objectified in their vehicles of transport!

Benaroya, expanding her mission, experiments with time travel and finds Lincoln, Woolf, Heidi, to be no less insance. Mixture of fictional and "real" characters? Humans, those pitiful creatures, get all hung up on the need to compartmentalize.

This is the greatest employment of science fiction in the service of satire; we've had notable satirists---but Scott alone refuses to sentimentalize.

Scott published a severely cut version of her first novel Down Will Come Baby (never appeared in book form) in the 7/68 Escapade, a third novel, I, Vampire, appeared in 1980. A scattering of short stories in the science fiction magazines, "The Two-D Problem" and "Go for Baroque" were in here in the mid-sixties.

*Rude Tales and Glorious* (1984)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0517549867/[Amazon]

*****
I finally received, from an endearing, if not downright useful cousin, a copy (hardbound , first edition in fact) of Rude Tales and Glorious -- the elusive print of an equally elusive author named Nicholas Seare (aka Trevanian aka UT Professor Rod Whitaker -- he of the numerous PhD's and other alphabetically-induced suffixes).

At the risk of waxing quotidian, my only regret is not having read this piece of literature sooner. This is an irreverent, audaciously humorous send-up of Arthurian history -- albeit Arthuriana's numerous manifestations and interpretations (and those are just the "ations," as Trevanian would say.)

Chaucer finds a more than worthy if not altogether brilliant extension of his idea in Seare's work.

The novel, in classic Trevanian-esque jest and joust (similarly used in Incident at Twenty Mile) purports to have had a solid foundation in history -- Rude Tales and Glorious claiming to be a contemporary translation of the author's ancestor's work.

Set in a Welsh knight's castle on a wintry evening, two beggar's claiming to be Launcelot and the Lady Elaine(of 600 years past) regale the dinner party with tales of the "real" Arthurian history in exchange for the orts and leavings of the feast -- "generously" given by a tale-thirsty lord.

Completing the cast at dinner are the typical suspects of this genre; the bungling knight and his warped-sense of valor (along the liberal democratic tradition), a hypocritical lothario of a priest ( also along the same liberal democratic tradition), lusty maidens (thus given to same previously-mentioned political affinity), and the servile servants (as they should be..being of the conservative republican staff). All complemented with similarly-inclined characters in the tale (of Arthur) within a tale.

All this is told in melliflous euphony evidenced in the English gentry's pedant in vocabulary and Twain's subtle comedy. Existent too, are Seare's/Trevanian's distaste for his perpetual foe -- the merchant, coupled with light-hearted jabs (though painful enough) at the Academic Illuminati of which Seare/Trevanian/Whitaker was, for a considerable portion of his life, a part of.

The entire body of work is prefaced with the autumnal sentimentality that Seare/Trevanian allows to epiphanize quite rarely though elegantly (inspired, no doubt, by the aesthete on poetic melancholy, Kawabata Yasunari) in his other works.

The tale is charmingly irreverent, and the telling is valiant and inspired!

Hope everyone has the opportunity and the pleasure to read this fine work. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EI73DMNK1FI9/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0517549867&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

Having grown up in the 1970's as neighbor to the author who originated the name Trevanian, I can tell you he is not the UT Professor Whitaker. Whitaker I believe assumed the Trevanian mantle at some point, but he did not write the early Seare or early Trevanian works. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A21WU15NR9KIDG/ref=cm_cr_rev_detpdp[Lad]

*****
In this literary labour dedicated to his children, 1339...or So reveals Rod Whitaker at his most lacerating disposition...and perhaps his most poignant. By way of the verbal prestidigitation of a pedlar (and through his Welsh-incarnation Nicholas Seare), Whitaker articulates his insights into human nature and the human condition; at times painful, but always illuminating. The Pedlar is a "glib" of fabulous colour and piercing intellect -- part world-weary cynic, part jaded sentimental -- reminiscent of other characters who inhabited Whitaker's literature under the Trevanian nom de plume. But in this End of the World setting, the entrancing prestidigiator's pointed wit ultimately gives way to poignant self-realisation which Whitaker delivers in fine, unforgettable, and autumnal fashion. -- 1339...or So saw its inception as Rod Whitaker's masteral thesis titled "Eve of the Bursting." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VV9G9ZZK4DJI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151899355&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[jjose]

*****
The first installment in Dis Voir's new "illustrated fairy tales for adults," The Adventures of Percival is based on the classic probability proposition that a chimpanzee randomly typing will eventually type a Shakespeare sonnet. Here, McIntosh, a gardener-mathematician (and spiritual cousin of Baron Münchhausen), decides to take the fable seriously, and with the assistance of a typewriter and a chimpanzee called Percival, undertakes to enact the experiment. Naturally things don't go as planned, as the chimpanzee proves to be less compliant than expected and bizarre behavioral mergings occur between man and animal. Nicolas de Crécy's comic drawings sometimes illustrate and sometimes contradict Senges' narrative, or inveigle themselves between his lines like a creeper. Inspired by research in animal behavior led by Dominique Lestel, and by the work of the landscape artist-gardener Alain Richert, Senges' tale of interspecies cognition makes a conscious nod towards contemporary debates within the cognitive sciences. - https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Percival-Phylogenetic-Illustrated-Adults/dp/2914563477/[Amazon blurb]

http://www.cetteadressecomportecinquantesignes.com/Luigi.Serafini.-.Codex.Seraphinianus.pdf[Codex Seraphinianus]

*****
Originally published in Italy in 1981, the Codex Seraphinianus appears to be an encyclopedia for a world very different from Earth. It is profusely illustrated with colored-pencil drawings of fantastic beings, many of which are hybrids between categories that we generally consider wholly separate: animal-machine, vegetable-mineral. The drawings are accompanied by a ‘text’ of the encyclopedia that is written in an invented alphabet, which may or may not conceal an actual language. Neither the alphabet nor the presumed underlying language have yet been deciphered, despite the efforts of scholars and cryptographers around the world.[1] The author of the Codex is Italian designer, architect, and artist Luigi Serafini, whose name is encoded in the book's title.

The Argentinian writer and editor Alberto Manguel, coauthor of the Dictionary of Imaginary Places, has given this near mythic account of the Codex’s origin:

“One summer afternoon in 1978, a voluminous parcel arrived in the offices of the publisher Franco Maria Ricci in Milan, where I was working as foreign-language editor. When we opened it we saw that it contained, instead of a manuscript, a large collection of illustrated pages depicting a number of strange objects and detailed but bizarre operations, each captioned in a script none of the editors recognized. The accompanying letter explained that the author, Luigi Serafini, had created an encyclopedia of an imaginary world along the lines of a medieval scientific compendium: each page precisely depicted a specific entry, and the annotations, in a nonsensical alphabet which Serafini had also invented during two long years in a small apartment in Rome, were meant to explain the illustrations’ intricacies.”[2]

Even without a legible text, it is clear that the Codex Seraphinianus exploits the encyclopedia form not so much to assert real authenticity as to frame itself as a coherent, self-consistent, deeply elaborated exercise in world-building. The Codex may be an homage to another famous undeciphered book, the Voynich manuscript now in Yale’s Beinecke Rare Books Library. Like the Codex Seraphinianus, the hundred-odd pages of the Voynich manuscript bear a range of fantastical drawings and diagrams accompanied by a coded hand-written text. It also very probably owes at least a passing debt to Jorge Luis Borges’s variant version of the Encylopedia Brittanica in “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,” which Borges describes as “a substantial fragment of the complete history of an unknown planet, with its architecture and its playing cards, its mythological terrors and the sound of its dialects, its emperors and its oceans, its minerals, its birds, and its fishes, its algebra and its fire, its theological and metaphysical  arguments.”[3] And it almost certainly is linked to the speculative biology of Serafini’s fellow Italian artist and author, Leo Lionni, whose book Parallel Botany was originally published in Italian (La botanica parallela) in 1976. - http://fictive.arts.uci.edu/codex_seraphinianus[fictive art]
*****

*****
Written in a language that no one understands and filled with illustrations of surreal, impossible things, Codex Seraphinianus is possibly the strangest encyclopedia in the world. When Italian architect Luigi Serafini published the book in 1981, he presented it as a factual, scientific work. One look at the outlandish potpourri of images, however, reveals that Codex Seraphinianus is anything but scientific.

The entire book is handwritten, and the illustrations are all hand drawn and colored by Serafini himself, a task that he labored over for two years. Scholars have spent years trying to decipher the book, but the only thing we’ve figured out is that “Seraphinianus” is just a variation of Serafini’s name. As for the book’s language, the “alphabet” has about two dozen characters, and relates to absolutely nothing else humanity has ever created. - http://listverse.com/2014/03/30/10-of-the-most-bizarre-books-ever-written/[Andrew Handley]

*Before and During* (2015)

*****
Set in a psychiatric clinic in Moscow in the long decades of late-Soviet stagnation, Before and During sweeps the reader away from its dismal surroundings on a series of fantastical excursions into the Russian past. We meet Leo Tolstoy’s twin brother, eaten by the great writer in his mother’s womb, only to be born as Tolstoy’s ‘son’; the philosopher-hermit Nikolai Fyodorov, who believed that the common task of humanity was the physical resurrection of their ancestors; a self-replicating Madame de Staël who, during her second life, is carried through plague-ridden Russia in a glass palanquin and becomes Fyodorov’s lover; and the composer Alexander Scriabin, who preaches to Lenin on the shores of Lake Geneva. Out of these intoxicating, darkly comic fantasies – all described in a serious, steady voice – Sharov seeks to retrieve the hidden connections and hidden strivings of the Russian past, its wild, lustful quest for justice, salvation and God. 'Before and During is not a historical novel. Rather, it is closer to one of Mikhail Bakhtin's carnivalesque venues, a Menippean satire in which historical reality, in all its irreversible awfulness, is for a moment scrambled, eroticized ... and illuminated by hilarious monologues of the dead... There are wonderful stretches: an exegesis of Tolstoy's failure to achieve the good in his own family;... an astonishing olfactory history of the First World War and Revolution through Scriabin's music. How Sharov resolves the rejection of death is especially good... With this elegant and dry-eyed translation by Oliver Ready, anglophone audiences can finally weigh in.' Caryl Emerson in The Times Literary Supplement 'Sharov has assimilated, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, the artistic and philosophical legacy of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries of Russian literature. Like Dostoevsky, he is excessive not in order to deny, misrepresent, or flee reality but, rather, to capture it more accurately.'

[[Nifft_the_Lean]]
*Nifft the Lean* (1982)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879977833[Amazon]

*****
How many books have you read that begin with a eulogy for the title character? _Nifft the Lean_ starts with a promise of hard-edged, high-intensity dark fantasy, and then delivers in four masterful novelettes.

Set in a lurid, bizarre world reminiscent of Jack Vance's "Dying Earth", these stories relate how Nifft and various partners wager their very souls in the course of pursuing their "art". With atmosphere surpassing that of even the greatest masters of dark fantasy, Shea matches eerie visions with sheer horror to create his own flavor of sword and sorcery.

Shea is able to create a character in Nifft that transcends the common fantasy stereotypes often found in second rate fiction and role-playing game supplements. Nifft and his main partner, Barnar, are not tricksters, silly picaros, or slinking alley trash; they are mercenary hereos with their own amoral code of honor. Like Howard's Conan, and Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Shea's characters are the kind of men who show disdain for wealth by stealing a fortune and then drinking it all away. The cosmology of Nifft's world is reminiscent of that found in the ancient epics of Gilgamesh, or Homer, where a man must strive to live boldly and well, since no paradise lies beyond death.

Where Shea truly shines is in his powers of description. Nifft, Barnar and the other characters tromp through a chaotic landscape rife with gruesome detail. Vivid settings, such as those encountered in the Land of Death, or the first Demon Subworld, are not easily forgotten. Shea also makes masterful use of perspective: one story being narrated by Nifft himself, others being third person accounts, or first person narrations by friends of Nifft, pretending to be Nifft... All in all, Shea provides us with a great variety of narrative styles.

Even those who normally disdain sword and sorcery type fiction as hackneyed and simplistic are urged to read _Nifft the Lean_. Shea brings a new level of intellegence to the genre rarely seen in recent decades. A man is drug forcibly down through the depths of hell. What is the final torture awaiting him there? Probably not what you think....

Shea, unfortunately not a very prolific author, has shown his mastery in this work (Nifft the Lean even won the World Fantasy award for best novel, 1983!). Be on the lookout for a new edition of this book in the fall, hopefully followed soon by a sequel!. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R29UC48MVJ0H6X/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0879977833&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*In Yana, the Touching of Undying* (1985)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Yana-Touch-Undying-Michael-Shea/dp/0886770807/[Amazon]

*****
Commonly my jaw will drop while reading Michael Shea's haunting image-laden prose. IN YANA, THE TOUCH OF UNDYING is his finest work, better than his Nifft stories, which is saying a lot: they induce jaw-dropping syndrome too. Everything author Shea excels at can be found in IN YANA, THE TOUCH OF UNDYING.

The novel begins with a man lunching in an eating establishment. Ironically I learned about this book the same way. I picked IN YANA off a used book rack in a café to kill time while waiting for my lunch. When my meal arrived I put the book back on the shelf and ate, but those first few pages where Bramt Hex decides to order homunculus stayed with me. The next day I hurried back to that café and bought IN YANA before some wiser soul than I absconded with it. I'm glad I did and knew I'd made the right decision a few chapters later when a building is literally sawn out of the ground at its foundation, inhabitants and all, and transported away aerially. By the time Shea got Hex to the tree slums I was hopelessly ensnared in the word pictures hyperventilating on the page.

That was almost 30 years ago and I didn't know then just how much Michael Shea was influenced by Jack Vance. I've owned Vance books since Jeff Jones was painting the Ace covers for Vance's Tschai series in the late sixties. Lately I've been reading Vance's Cugel stories (Shea published one himself) and was surprised to find homunculus mentioned at the beginning of THE EYES OF THE OVERWORLD (why I was surprised is surprising because homunculus, or the concept of it, has been around centuries before Vance was born). As entertaining and well-written as Cugel's follies are he comes across like a modernized Arlecchino from Commedia dell'arte, a slapstick sad sack scoundrel, not a hero, and not a very likable character either despite his inevitable and numerous comeuppances. On the other hand Shea intended protagonist Bramt Hex to be a louse too in IN YANA, THE TOUCH OF UNDYING yet Hex is a babe-in-the-woods compared to Cugel, less conniving, more a lazy opportunist than a louse.

[possible SPOILER this paragraph] Hex's reward at the conclusion of the story is as unexpected as anything that precedes it, almost as if he's transformed, redeemed, absolved of his sins.

By allowing Hex to grow and change as a character, even a little, Shea has done what so-called real novelists purport to do. IN YANA, THE TOUCH OF UNDYING is not a true picaresque novel the way Shea's NIFFT THE LEAN is, but by strict definition IN YANA is literature in spite of Shea operating in the déclassé fantasy genre theater. Like Bramt Hex, the unsavory Nifft is easier to relate to than the unsavory Cugel, but as much as I like the fantastical adventures of Nifft (particularly the ones set in Hell) I liked Hex's more. And I don't dislike Cugel---it's just that I know too many similar real people. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N70Y4XPV6NA3/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0886770807&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Swordsman]

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0575003510/[Amazon]

*****
Published under this [] title JOURNEY BEYOND TOMORROW, its real title is JOURNEY OF JOENES and it is one of the strangest, most brilliant and touching satires ever written. If Jorge Luis Borges and G.K. Chesterton stayed up all night doing coffee and shrooms, this is the book they'd come up with. As Mike Resnick said in his review, the section about the Octagon is so mind-blowing and so full of comic paradox you'll need to take a deep breath and have a cocktail while your cerebellum cools off.

This book takes place after the world has ended. The conceit is that it is a collection of "folk tales" by the only survivors of the human race, Polynesian storytellers. The storytellers, each with separate idiosyncracies, go around the campfire telling the stories that were passed down to them about The Old Times. About how the world came to an end because of a Mythic Innocent named Joenes who accidentally causes the End of the World. In the process, he finds Jesus Christ in the Hollis Home for the Criminally Insane, is hired as a college professor but has no idea what he's teaching, finds that scientists and lawyers now worship superstition with a random number generator as their oracle, that doctors are creating diseases that cannot be cured, that maximum security prisons have more guards than ever because everyone is trying to break *into* prison, and that the world's most advanced computer humiliates Satan and takes over his job inspiring mankind to a new level of cruelty and war.

I can't tell you how much I love Sheckley. His stories are, as Spider Robinson once said, lean, mean and funny. And his best novels, like Journey of Joenes (aka Journey Beyond Tomorrow, ugh what a title!) are profound masterpieces of satire on the level of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, CATCH 22, JURGEN, THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER or THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY.

Read this, his other ingenious satirical novels DIMENSION OF MIRACLES and MINDSWAP, and his greatest short stories, especially in the collection IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE DO? - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q5BBLKZ2XX7H/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0575003510&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E.

The Wart-Hog has been overshadowed by his more famous slacker siblings the Freak Brothers and it's a crying shame. Seriously, he edges out Mr Natural as my all-time favourite comic character - or should that be 'tragic'? [Third comes Jim Meddick's Monty - but he's only in cyberspace.]

I must also put in a plug here for the wondrous but possibly untranslatable Rat-Man (like the Wart-Hog he affects a hyphen) turned out monthly by the indefatigable Leo Ortolani and available at any news-stand in Italy; take one back for someone you love and have them translate it for you! All three (that rogue Mr N aside) are dealing with failure, something we all have difficulty in confronting, either in life or in books (how many books are there titled Know your Limitations, for instance, yet that is the oldest wisdom) and the humour lies in their state of denial. Wart-Hog is the most heroic, Monty the most introverted - and Rat-Man? he is perhaps the absurd dreamer in all of us, battered but insouciant.

*****
"Three books make up about seventy-five percent of Shklovsky’s total literary output, including all that’s been translated into English to date: A Sentimental Journey; Zoo, or Letters Not about Love; and Third Factory. All three can be viewed together as an extended memoir, but a memoir-in-forms, each book structurally unique, and each containing elements of novel, poem, essay, and rant. They are also a good introduction to Shklovsky’s writing as a whole, because they are his most personal books, the most emotionally and stylistically extreme, and because in them we see the passionate motives behind the study of artistic forms that spanned the next sixty years of his life.

The first of the three, A Sentimental Journey (1922), is the only one that calls itself a memoir and is closest to what a reader might expect from one, with long narrative passages describing Shklovsky’s experiences as commander of an armored-car division through a world war and revolution—from Russia to Persia and back, living intermittently as a writer and critic, eventually landing in Germany. Shklovsky treats the sequence of these events loosely, concerned less with their historical relevance than with capturing the particulars of his own experience, material culled from every type of source: the physical realities of the moment, the political and social milieu, literary history, the war, the weather. He arranges these materials the way a collage artist might, placing distinct pieces and passages beside each other, these juxtapositions creating internal tensions and a sense of movement as the narrative trips back and forth between contrasting “things and thoughts.” For example, on page nine of A Sentimental Journey, Shklovsky writes: “Bread was bought from the soldiers. The crusts and scraps which, along with the sour smell of servitude, had been the trademark of barracks now disappeared.” He places “the sour smell of servitude” into a sentence about bread crusts, making the sentence resonate in unexpected ways, even while the bread crusts themselves remain bread crusts (i.e., a tactile image, rather than becoming a symbol for servitude, or being overshadowed by the political presence of the soldiers). Thus he encompasses a range of images, ideas, perspectives, etc., without losing a sense of direct engagement with the physical world.

What makes A Sentimental Journey seem more stylistically conventional than the later books is that (not discounting the above example) these kinds of juxtapositions are more often between paragraphs or whole passages than within a single line. He’ll place a personal anecdote alongside instructions on how to operate an armored car, for example, or a landscape alongside a discourse on creativity and freedom. He balances styles against each other—analytical descriptions against impassioned wisecracks—and the resulting contrasts make the experience of reading overtly participatory, at times even jarring, as the reader becomes momentarily aware of the “strangeness” of one kind of writing (or way of seeing) standing alongside (and in relation to) another." - https://www.dalkeyarchive.com/reading-viktor-shklovsky-with-a-little-bit-about-jonathan-franzen/[Martin Riker]

[[Love_in_a_Dead_Language]]
*Love in a Dead Language* (2000, 408)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226756998/[+https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226756998/+]

*****
"One of the most striking things about Love in a Dead Language is that it has, not one, but five, dedications. This is the first indication that this book is going to be something completely out of the ordinary. And it is.

The first dedication is from Lee Siegel, a professor of Indian religions at the University of Hawaii, the author of this very unusual book. The second is from the Hindu sage Vatsyayana, author the classic (and silly) treatise on love, the Kamasutra. Then there are also dedications from the novel's own cast of characters: Leopold Roth, a fictional professor of linguistics who attempted to translate the Kamasutra; Pralayananga Lilaraja, a medieval scholar; and Anang Saighal, and Indo-Jewish graduate student, who, according to this story, has just put the entire volume together.

After this rather unorthodox beginning, Love in a Dead Language just keeps getting better and better and more and more inventive. It is, reportedly, Roth's failed attempt at translation, along with his commentary. Together they form, not his own view of the Kamasutra, but rather his obsession with, and seduction of, a beautiful Indo-American girl, Lalita Gupta. (Yes, this is an allusion to Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, and it is not the only Nabokov allusion in this novel, all to the good.)

These two texts are accompanied by comments and footnotes from Pralayananga, also autobiographical, and Saighal, who completes the narrative after Roth is murdered when an unknown assailant hurls a Sanskrit-English dictionary squarely at his head.

Interspersed among this madness are extracts of Hollywood movie scripts about India, posters of Mira Nair's film, Kamasutra, a term paper complete with the teacher's notes and pages from a comic book Kamasutra (as if the original isn't comic enough). Then we have the real and imagined quotes from the real and imagined writers on India from various centuries, letters, including one from Siegel, and, most hilarious of all, bits and pieces from the memoirs of a ninety-five year old movie star which are, amazingly, dedicated to a porn actress. The above are already more surprises than almost any book packs, but Love in a Dead Language packs even more. A little more than halfway through, we must turn the book upside down, since one of the chapters is printed that way. Deliberately, of course.

Siegel's inventiveness and originality of style are not the only thing that distinguishes this book. His use of language is nothing if it is not brilliant and creative. Siegel masters so many styles and voices it's difficult to believe he created them all. There is the erudite academic, the barely-literate jock, the silly campus newspaper, the just-average student. Amazingly, Siegel writes parodic Hinglish, American slang and flowery Victoriana with equal style, wit and aplomb. The result is both hilarious and hysterical.

The book ends with a bibliography that is so convincing you will be tempted to take it seriously. Don't. It would only spoil the fun. And fun, above all else, is what this book is about. There are more jokes, puns, asides and riddles in this book than any one person can possibly mine. It is virtuoso feat of the highest order. A sweet, methodical madness that will leave you laughing so hard you'll find it difficult to keep on reading." - Departed Amazon Customer

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Slow-Chocolate-Autopsy-Incidents-Notorious/dp/1861590881/[Amazon]

*****
This is a book like no other. It can be challenging to read and difficult to describe. Precisely why I thoroughly enjoyed it!

"Slow Chocolate Autopsy" is a collection of twelve short stories concerning the enigmatic Norton. Known as "The Prisoner of London", he is trapped within the space of the London city limits, but not in time. However, those hoping for an adventure similar to those of that other famous British time traveler (Who?) may be disappointed.

Norton doesn't move through time so much as just appear at pivotal points of London history.

Iain Sinclair never states outright what's happening. He relies heavily on historical reference and local slang to convey his settings. Dropping tight bursts of staccato clues, he lets the reader puzzle it out. But regardless of whether it's the 70's or the 1700's, Norton is there.

People will either enjoy Sinclair's writing style or find it inaccessible. He frequently interchanges metaphor with imagery and it's difficult to determine when the switch occurs. The prose is minimalist and truncated so this is not a book one can scan. Hugely important detail can be missed if every word is not carefully read.

Yet it's that sheer efficiency I appreciated the most. Where other authors might use sweeping descriptive paragraphs, Sinclair can convey the same mood, tone and imagery in a single well-crafted sentence.

Four of the stories are mini graphic novels drawn by Dave McKean (of "Batman: Arkham Asylum" fame). His strange collage of impressionist drawings over distorted photos compliment Sinclair's tone beautifully.

Overall, I found this books to be almost like a Zen koan...seemingly incomprehensible at first, but more revealing with subsequent reads and contemplation.

It's not for everyone, but anyone willing to take the risk will be taken on a trippy, mind-bending journey.

Oh...and yes. The title is explained in one of the stories. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNZVH75D5VR5/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1861590881&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[eShu]

[[Landors_Tower]]
*Landor's Tower* (2001)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1862070180[Amazon]

*****
Right. So, here we have a narrative of sorts about a tower that was never built (only planned by a somewhat obscure literary figure, Walter Savage Landor - though perhaps the least obscure of the many authors to whom the author alludes herein) about an author planning to write a novel that it turns out he can't write. It's set in Wales- er, mostly, sort of, a bit in London too. According to the book, "Wales is the perfect locale. An hour's tramp would lead the most vacant optimist to thoughts of suicide." Thus, what we have is a wandering pilgrimage set in richly allusive, delightfully funny at times prose - prose which only someone steeped in all things obscurely literary or the omniscient cineaste (I was surprised that the reviews failed to mention how much the book owes to obscure films, lighting techniques etc.)can fully appreciate. Also, and this really cannot be overstated, we have a sort of dandyish form of what the French refer to as a nostalgia de la boue. Sinclair loves wending his way through all the contemporary muck of today's Britain in search of the muck of past, forgotten (admittedly unjustly so in many cases) poets, literary figures of all sorts, and pieces of rare filmography. - I suppose you can stop here if this sort of thing doesn't appeal to you.

But this faithful and appreciative reviewer shall trundle on. Something must be said here about the fad of "psychogeography" which Sinclair has helped to inspire. A great deal of literary London is, as I write this review, under the spell of it, due to the highly articulate proselyte and author Will Self. Unfortunately, Self, whilst an eloquent orator, simply can't write well; and I keep wondering when the English press is going to come to its senses. But the less-celebrated Sinclair is a wizard with prose:

"I trembled that first morning out in the air, the privilege of this light, with the stereophonic babble of the river, hustling against rocks, rattling against pebbles, sweeping broken branches downstream at Crickhowell. Dry red leaves caught in the fuzz of the hedge, giving it a wounded look. The gardens had been designed as shadow traps. Avenues, abandoned tennis courts, in which speckled paths appeared and disappeared, as fast-moving clouds masked the sun."

Read these deliciously falling cadences aloud. Notice how everything in Sinclair ends up "abandoned" or "wounded" or derelict or flickering out of sight. The prose is very, very rich and funny, but you have to be very well-read and cultured to laugh aloud as I did at snippets such as these:

Describing his postcoital pillow talk with Prudence:

"She really couldn't see what these new painters, the Pre-Raphaelites, were on about."

Describing the burning of Landor's estate, which had been converted into a monastery at the time:

"Most authorities agreed that the blaze, the destruction of the castle, Gormenghast revisited, was down to the drunken odd job man."

LOL- Gormenghast Revisited indeed!

I could go on with these quotes. But those who can will get the drift. Those who can't won't.
It would be very easy for me to pick apart this plotless "novel," but I have no need. Sinclair, with his pixie wit, does it already in the form of the demotic character - lots of these in the book - nicknamed "Bad News":

"What's with this three-part structure? One: lowlifes running around, getting nowhere. Two: a baggy central section investigating `place', faking at poetry, genre tricks, and a spurious narrative which proves incapable of resolution. Three: quelle surprise. A walk in the wilderness. What a cop-out, man!" p.285

Still, if you half fancy this sort of thing, as I half do, and enjoy rich allusive language, than you could do far worse than open this book and step into the muck "on a morning of treacherous, milky sunshine" or whenever, really. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWWTROKZRWP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1862070180&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Daniel Myers]

*****
"I was reading about Knox's translation of "The Imitation of Christ", and it was talking about how he had singlehandedly translated the Bible, and how he had joked about putting at the front of it, "By the Author of The Viaduct Mystery." So that was how Knox came on my radar--- amazingly educated, wonderfully literate, fluent in so many languages, elegant in his translations, a sense of humor, and he wrote mysteries for fun. What wasn't there to admire?! That was also how I ran into his "Ten Commandments" for mystery authors. I see them broken all the time, but they seem to have been broken very deliberately post-Knox, rather than very annoyingly pre-Knox. So when I saw there was a book dedicated to systematically breaking his rules, I definitely wanted to give it a read.

Josef Škvorecký was a Czech-Canadian writer (1924-2012). Czechoslovakia changed a lot during the time he lived there (1924-1968? 1969?), and one of the things that really stands out in his books is how his characters are ordinary people, and have to roll with the communism that dictates so many aspects of their lives. Because the nature of pretty much every crime relates to someone's love life, love, sex, and romance also play a heavy part in each scenario. Eve sings at night clubs; most of the rest of the female supporting characters perform with fewer clothes. All of them are always on the look-out for the man who will give them stability, normalcy, love, romance, a family, and maybe even a ticket out of Communism.

The stories themselves are easy reads. Apart from Škvorecký's detective, Boruvka, who makes an appearance in the first and last stories, and Eve herself, who is a character in every one of them, there is frequently a small amount of overlap in the characters--- her friend Zuzka, or reference to some other person from the old country, etc-- but most of the characters are unique to each of the ten short stories. It can be a little difficult to keep all the different relationships organized in your head while you're reading--- business partners, children, business partners' children, ex-lovers, brothers-in-law, who hired who to do what, and so on. The plots themselves move rapidly, so keeping motivations, histories, and backstories tidy isn't always easy as you try to mentally sift through what's significant, and what's just background noise. Likewise, it invites you to guess which commandment is being broken--- and sometimes key information is held for the explanation, that would have been helpful to have in hand when trying to guess the answer. More than once, I was sure the answer was, "Number 8! Number 8 is the broken commandment!"

Still, it's a fine book. I suspect it will be more enjoyable on the re-read, since you're better able to see how the pieces fit together properly in hindsight. And that's really one of the best reasons to read this: to appreciate why the commandments were set up in the first place, and then to appreciate how they can be properly broken, rather than using it as a cheap gotcha.

I look forward to tracking down the author's three other Boruvka books, which have been translated into English." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HCFL1U48XB5I/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393307875[DB]

*****
It is, I think, the quiet brilliance of Sladek's word-play that is the most endearing thing about this novel. The plot is about a man who has accidentally been downloaded onto computer tape...or perhaps about the crazed billionaire who collects the reels of tape...or perhaps about the frustrated Men's Magazine publisher...or perhaps about the man's son, Sturgemore, nicknamed "Spot"...or perhaps about a televangelist who replaces himself with an audioanimatron...which happens to be programmatically controlled by one of the reels of tape...

Sladek weaves plots the way Penelope weaved wool on her loom: just when you think you might know what will happen next, it all unravels before your eyes. I think, in the entire novel, only one person really sees what is going on: our computerized protagonist. (Or, just maybe, the drunk Interpol agent!)

And, to drive the point home, firmly yet with love, there is a massive riot in Washington at the end, erupting over race, religion, sexual orientation, and even species-discrimination gets into the act. All of the various plot-lines collide -- violently.

The litany of the lucky millionaires, and the visit to Bibleland, pay for this book just by themselves! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVLCQ9Z4CQ57/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6SOCU8&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Silas Sparkhammer]

"The title character is a 'domesticated robot' living in a time when most humans own at least one and sometimes more, using them as slaves; as he awaits jugement for crimes he perpetrated, he writes his memoirs. Sladek uses a lively back-and-forth structure that weaves together two main timelines. Tik-Tok, in platonic terms, is a 'liberated prisoner' among robots: unlike the others, he is aware of what went behind his construction and 'education', but rather than alerting the other robots, he is more interested in making various experiments to see how far he can go with this discovery. His actions speak less of a downright vengeance on his one-time human masters than of curiosity - hence his relative contempt for both humans (because of their lies and contradictions) and robots (for their incapacity to wake up and refuse passive submission). The conscience of his freedom liberates him from what humans have called 'Azimov circuits' (based on the three inhibitory laws formulated by Isaac Asimov), but these, as he remarks, could very well be illusions used to solidify human authority. There's a relentless cynicism, even nihilism running through the entire work, but it is mainly upsetting because it forces the reader to re-evaluate preconceptions about the world. Whether 'Tik-Tok' ultimately convinces us of its conclusions or not, the book is too powerful to ignore." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SCNXDNMA92C4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0575033363[Amazon Customer]

"Bugs is Sladek at his most darkly satirical. It's about a British man rather bewilderedly encountering the American scene: as such it reminded me of a couple of books by Amises: Kingsley's One Fat Englishman, and much more closely, Martin's Money, which is a near contemporary to Bugs. All those books are satirical, and Money shares with Bugs a truly bitter edge, though Money is longer, dirtier, more vulgarly over the top.

Bugs opens with Manfred ("Fred") Jones, a failed English novelist, trying to find the offices of Vimnut, a Minneapolis company for whom he hopes to become a technical writer. When he finally finds it (this having been complicated by among other things the company having changed its name) he is hired, after certain mixups, as a software engineer. (I am of course a software engineer, and these aspects of the book were pretty funny and fairly true to life.) It seems that his resume was confused with that of Mansour Jones, a black man fully qualified for the job. Fred is afraid to complain that he isn't qualified, and it soon appears that that doesn't matter.

Fred's department is charged with developing a robot officer for the military. His coworkers are variously completely insane, completely idiotic, or simply burnt out. Somehow the robot still manages to get built, though in the manner of numerous Sladek robots (robots were probably his chief SFnal device) it turns out to be murderous in a very funny way.

Fred himself has more significant personal problems to deal with. His wife has left him because she can't stand America. Still, before long he has three women on a string, without really trying: a Russian spy, the wife of his boss (who keeps asking him to imitate different famous Englishmen), and a beautiful co-worker with whom he falls immediately and desperately in love, to her initial feminist disgust. Fred also keeps getting fired and rehired, he somehow never gets paid by the company, Mansour Jones hounds him about stealing his rightful job, his insane co-worker tries to kill him ... and of course when the robot escapes he's really in trouble.

It's a very funny, very dark book." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD2J192CYNN9O/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0333490606[Richard R. Horton]

*****
"This is a marvelous story of simultaneous and converging conspiracies and chance events, the origin, life and fate of Roderick Wood, robot, being the central theme running throughout.

The story is very much dialogue driven, with character development and interaction taking precidence over, I felt, plotlines, world building etc. but this creates a fantastic pace and lends real page turning impetus to the progress of the storyline. In some ways I was disappointed with the finish, it seemed to end a little abruptly considering how the story had progressed to that point but it did feature solid conclusions for each of the characters which had been introduced throughout, this is the case with both of the books which make up this single volume.

The book answers many of the questions which have haunted science fiction about why the hoped for "tommorrow" never arrived, doing so well through the dialogue and sequencing of chance events and accidents but also providing summation points which allow a kind of "recap" or "clarification" of the suspiscions anyone would have from reading up to that point. I liked this because between times the reader is allowed to do their own thinking and figure out what is happening but isnt left wondering entirely as to what was happening. There isnt really any surplus content but there are points at which you may be tempted to skip blocks of dialogue from parties or other scenes in which people are talking about intellectual diversions or academic subjects.

Roderick himself is "born" as a consequence of a scam ran by a high ranking government official who has been misappropriating funds, the resulting cover up succeeds in covering up his existence for a time too, although attempts to destroy him and others involved in his development are bungled repeatedly or ruined by chance and accident. This introduces the theme of conspiracy and technological repression, there's good consideration of no matter how powerful and sophisticated a conspiracy may be that it is still subject to chance, caprice and the individual prejudice or accident effecting key players in its operation. Roderick himself develops and investigates the human condition throughout the book, appearing as the most human of all most of the time, discovers just what has happened and how his has benefited from the competition and conflict between government and private corporations, both equally reprehensible, amoral and pursuing their ends with murderous singularity of purpose.

This is a very good book, a real page turner, with characters you are likely to remember for a long time, I would consider it optimistic sci fi of a sort, despite the overwhelming alienation, perfidious plotting etc. and being in many ways dystopian until the conclusion its main protagonist shows what a life is worth and what can be made of life despite its difficulties." - (Former Amazon Customer) Lark

*****
"It seems whenever Halloween and Fall approach, someone writes a gushing column about Mr. Sloane's only two stories 'To Walk the Night' and 'The Edge of Running Water'. The fans urge the reader to read them at night and during the Fall., so I finally did. 'The Rim of Morning' cover in which both stories are included claims they are two tales of cosmic horror. I found them more suspenseful than scary. The stories were originally published separately in 1937 and 1939. These are Mr. Sloane's only two works. He decided after their publication to focus his energies on being an editor. It's a shame because I enjoyed both tales and would have read other works he created.

In Stephen King's introduction he states Mr. Sloane's pieces are difficult to categorize as strictly horror, science fiction, or mystery. I agree. Both stories have all three elements as well as some other similar qualities. Once in a great while the author makes references to either early Twentieth Century events or people such as Leopold and Loeb, Borgias, Praxiteles, Lochinvar, and Lethean that had me resorting to the Internet. Also common in both tales are that the main protagonists are highly-educated males with proper polite manners and an especially gifted academic pushing the boundaries of science and mathematics. They revolve around death and the soul. Both stories are also the retelling of events in the first person by guys who are so frequently in a state of anxiety about the oddities they should've been wearing adult diapers. Too smart for their own good is the constant theme in these things.

The stories are entertaining but melancholy. The only thing I found slightly annoying was the depiction of rural Mainers. Speaking as a lifelong Maine resident, the second work 'The Edge of Running Water' depicts 1930s small-town Mainers in a less than flattering light. Mercy, we Mainers back in the olden days must've been some ornery folks. There are a few friendly souls but most of the town's people in the story seem about as bright as rhubarb and one step away from field dressing out-of-staters like a deer bagged during hunting season." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19J5M29SGKZIN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590179064[Franklin the Mouse]

*****
"THORNE Smith's reputation rests on such mildly naughty 1920s and 1930s novels as Topper and The Night Life of the Gods. His typical protagonists were conventional folks whose dull lives were transformed by supernatural intervention into a riot of cheerful inebriation, discreet (offstage) sex, and the confounding of cops and judges, with dialogue that wandered away whenever a point threatened to come into sight.

Smith's only children's novel, Lazy Bear Lane, hews in part to the pattern, but has to substitute food for the adult pleasures of gin and canoodling. Elderly couple Peter and Mary are glumly starving in their dull little house, reduced to eating a stew made out of cuttings from a seed catalog, when a bear knocks on the door. Lazy Bear, who modestly admits to being magic, turns them back to the small children they once were and sends them out to find adventure. They are soon joined on their travels by Mr. Budge (whose own sole magical attribute is the much-appreciated one of a refilling picnic basket) and four abandoned circus performers: a female equestrian, a sad clown, and two timid talking lions.

Their travels take them to a bleak Christmas scene in the slums of Winter Town, where it is always winter; to an outdoor church service where the organist also teaches hunter avoidance classes to local deer; and to a flying ship crewed by penguins. Constant throughout are descriptions of meals, humorous poetry recited by Peter, and typically Smithian wandering/pun-filled conversations from all hands. As with his adult novels, the humor is tinged with melancholy never far below the surface: when someone says that the sad clown, Mr. Bingle, is "happy in his own strange way," his reply is that "I am…I'd much rather be sad than not funny."" - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2006/cur0605.htm[Dennis Lien]

Thorne Smith wrote a lot more than Topper. This, his most fantastic tale, has the flavor of a madcap R.A. Lafferty tale, as Mr. Hector Owen passes through a peculiar doorway into a Marx Brothers world in which, amid non-stop shenanigans, he learns certain important lessons.

*****
In the 1930's, an eccentric inventor/scientist invents a pair of rays that will turn people and animals into stone and back again. He gets drunk to celebrate and runs into a leprechaun who doesn't particularly like the Irish, but loves strong drink. He introduces him to his daughter Meg, who promptly seduces him. Together, they go to New York and bring the Roman Gods back from their stoney imprisonment in the Museum of Art.

Gods can not be bothered with foolishness like prohibition or policemen trying to enforce silly laws. But the intervening years have diminished their god-like powers and so the collection of a rich eccentric, a sultry leprechauness, and half a dozen Gods gets into modern trouble. They give as good as they get and after a battle with state police in which arrows, fountain pens, lots of booze, and a wall are featured, the gods and their rescuer/accomplice retire once more into statues.

Thorne Smith wrote romantic fantasy. In this, The "Nightlife of the Gods", he demonstrated the best of his imagination and gift for humor. Although this is more obscure than "Topper", it is among his best work and the humor bridges the decades since it was first published effortlessly. The characters are delightful conversationalists and the situations worthy of a new film.

Smith mixes humor, whiskey (which was illegal) and sexual situations with his fantasies. He constructs characters and shows his contempt for the hypocacies of his (and our) day with delightful skill. This is a fun read and fully worth pursuing through rare book stores. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SMAFQ5U2HM4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375753060&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Steven Lopata]

*****
The first novel by a major English writer that is devoted to a thoroughgoing portrait of villainy, The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom chronicles the life of an aberrant criminal character. Filled with striking satiric thrusts at the legal, medical, and military establishments of mid-eighteenth-century Europe and England, the novel reveals Tobias Smollett's capacities as a commentator on contemporary life.

First published in 1753, Ferdinand Count Fathom is an experimental work that explores the relations between history and fiction and introduces, for the first time in the English novel, episodes of Gothic melodrama. Too long neglected and never before available in a carefully prepared scholarly edition, Ferdinand Count Fathom may now be read, understood, and appreciated against the literary and historical background of the eighteenth-century world. - http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Ferdinand-Fathom-Tobias-Smollett/dp/0820310107/[Amazon boilerplate]

[[Expedition_of_Humphrey_Clinker]]
*The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker* (1771)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140430210/[Amazon]

*****
Tobias Smollett's 1771 novel, "The Expedition of Humphry Clinker," took me almost two months to read. The novel, a "sort of novel," as Dr. Johnson once said, I think of his own "Rasselas," doesn't really have a plot, which contributes to the pacing, which is slow, but highly enjoyable. From the beginning of April through the end of November, basically from the season of planting through the season of reaping, Squire Bramble, an irascible hypochondriac of a Welshman, and his family engage upon a series of travels which lead them from Wales through England to Scotland and back again.

An epistolary novel, "Humphry Clinker" is no stranger in format to the eighteenth century - however, odd to me was the fact that none of the writers - Squire Bramble, his sister Tabitha, their nephew and niece Jery and Lydia Melford, and Tabitha's waiting woman Winifred - ever receives a response. The letters of the Bramble expedition encompass a wide range of topics, along a range of experience and sentiment, of interaction, which itself is a veritable buffet of later eighteenth century customs, coffeehouse culture, civil engineering, agriculture, speech, fashion, science, moral philosophy, art, and manners spanning Wales, England, and Scotland, both in countryside and cityscape.

As such, the novel has a number of preoccupations - the social and political relations between different countries which comprised the then-British Empire - English-Scottish relations in particular are a focus, some 71 years after the Act of Union, and were pretty fascinating to me. There are a number of references to America, and to the Native Americans, which the Scot Cadwallader Colden had written of only a few years before in his "History of the Five Indian Nations." England's own internal politics are reflected on throughout the novel. The debate over luxury, a hot eighteenth century topic, is constantly in the background of the Bramble family's letters.

The letters of Squire Bramble to his doctor-friend Lewis and Jery Melford's to his college friend Wat Phillips comprise the bulk of the novel, and as with so many epistolary novels, their letters often tell us as much about their circumstances and exploits as they do about the writers themselves. These are both heroes of sensibility, a young and an old whose ages frequently provide interesting takes on the same events. Such can be said about the other writers as well - From the Squire to Jery to Tabitha to Lydia to Winifred - we are given a wealth of perspective and language - valuable lenses all to form our own opinions of the events, such as they are, that transpire in their travels. Their various perspectives on two of the novel's minor characters, the eponymous Humphry Clinker and the combative disputant Scot Obadiah Lismahago (the most cosmopolitan figure among the recurring characters), confer substance, interest, and warmth upon characters who do not themselves write letters.

As valuable and entertaining a travelogue as Voltaire's "Letters Upon England," or Smollett-rival Laurence Sterne's "Sentimental Journey through France and Italy," and as simultaneously celebratory and critical of sentimentality as Henry Mackenzie's "The Man of Feeling," "The Expedition of Humphry Clinker" was my first experience with Tobias Smollett, and certainly shall not be my last. Empahses on religion and reason, on intellect and emotion, on the state of marriage, on the Horatian preoccupation with how to live the good life, interest in literature and culture, and an almost universal eye for satire and critique make "Humphry Clinker" well worth taking the time to read slowly. It is a novel which I found both entertaining and edifying. Surely, a "great original." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VW33A7JJ9GKV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140430210&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[mp]

[[Roderick_Random]]
*The Adventures of Roderick Random*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Roderick-Random-Oxford-Classics/dp/0199552347/[Amazon]

*****
I never liked Georgian literature. Sir Walter Scott was as early as I was willing to go, and even then you have to squint as you read him, to ignore the stilted prose and maudlin love stories. Tristram Shandy, Tom Jones and Robinson Crusoe -- they all seem to get more wooden and unreal the further back you go.

But Roderick Random is proof that the people living 250 years ago were human. Smollett is often compared to Charles Dickens, a hundred years later, and there are similarities: Roderick wanders around the world like Nicholas Nickleby, getting into one mess after another, rich and poor, lucky and unlucky. Dickens was a better writer, and his humor is much more tasteful. (I counted three separate instances in R.R. where somebody gets a chamberpot dumped on his head.) But Dickens has a weirdly intrusive moral sense, with black villains and shining heroes. Nobody could possibly be as evil as Wackford Squeers, or as good as Nicholas. Why would you want to read about paragons?

By contrast, Roderick is just an ordinary guy, at least by 1740's standards. He's not much better than his antagonists, and there's no particular reason he should triumph over them. Sometimes he does, and sometimes he doesn't, but it's not important. There's romance and violence and drinking and gambling, but they're all incidental. Roderick may get beaten up or robbed, but in the next chapter life goes on. In that way, Roderick Random is less like Dickens or Thackeray, and more like a modern sitcom. What hijinks will Roderick get up to next week? Tune in to find out.

The most appealing element of Roderick Random is the 18th century itself, and what the simple fact of having a sympathetic, comprehensible hero can tell us about it. Roderick joins the navy and the army, he works as an apothecary and a slave trader, he's a fortune hunter and a professional gambler, he talks to prostitutes and failed playwrights. If Smollett's description of this stuff is varnished, it's impossible to tell.

The chapters with Roderick as a naval surgeon are particularly good -- that was Smollett's own profession for a while. This was one of the first novels ever set aboard ship, and Smollett realizes that most people don't know much about the life of a sailor. And since he can't assume his readers know anything, he takes care to describe all the loathsome details of naval life during the War of Jenkins' Ear, in a way that seems extremely fresh, even now.

Of course it all comes to an end. The back cover of the novel tells us that Roderick "recovers his long-lost father, marries his beloved Narcissa, and dispatches his enemies." The mere fact that Penguin so carelessly spoils the ending suggests how adventitious it is. These are just things that happen, and except inasmuch as they constitute an "ending", they don't matter much more than anything else that befalls Roderick in the 18th century. Every sitcom gets cancelled sooner or later. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQQFE1CHYE7N/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SYZXYC&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Alexander Kobulnicky]

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0820310735/[Amazon]

*****
In The History and Adventures of an Atom, a London haberdasher relates extraordinary tales of ancient Japan as dictated to him by an omniscient atom that has lived within the bodies of great figures of state. Intended “for the instruction of British ministers,” the work is a savage allegory of England during the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), draping kings and politicians, domestic and foreign affairs in an intricately detailed, endlessly allusive veil of satire.

Lacing his commentary with vitriol, Tobias Smollett gives fantastic expression in the Atom to many of the concerns voiced in his historical and political writings. He creates from the details of Japanese history an ingenious catalog of English places and personalities--from the up-start ruler “Taycho,” whose graspings for power resemble William Pitt’s, to a god of war called “Fatzman” who suggests the grotesquely obese Duke of Cumberland. Smollett also draws on the imagery of the period’s scurrilous political cartoons and injects into his satire a Rabelaisian humor that makes this work perhaps the most scatological in English literature.

Edited and introduced by Robert Adams Day, this edition of the Atom is the first to appear since 1926 and the first ever to provide a carefully prepared text, a full apparatus of historical annotations, and an accurate key to personages and places. Day establishes the authorship and the long-disputed work, placing it within the context of Smollett’s writings and opinions, his times and literary world. - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0820310735/[Amazon boilerplate]

Launcelot Greaves, Tobias Smollett's quixotic character, takes you on a hilarious journey filled with wonderfully funny scenes and characters. The book moves at the leisurely pace Smollett and Fielding made such excellent use of in their novels.

This book you finish with a grin and a wistful sigh, because you don't want the story to end, a novel both funny and thoughtful in the best of senses. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQIG2PS5X0UH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140433066&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0941423077[Amazon]

*****
Sokolov's "School for Fools" is a linguistically titillating thrill! The narrative consists of the network of memories, both childhood and adult, of a schizophrenic, integrated into a well crafted blend of innumerable references to works from genres encompassing an impressive range of both Russian and Western cultural traditions. The realist doubling that Dostoevsky uses so effectively to reveal the psychological state of his characters takes on new meaning in this post-modern, intertextual playground; the main character becomes a medium through which public and private memories interact, subtly illuminating the delicate subconscious threads that connect each to all. This disturbed child/man becomes a prophet to the mysteries of cultural development and the communal self through a deconstruction of the traditional sense of temporal linearity, individual identity and place. The novel is not what you might call a quick read. However, the combination of original insight and elegance of language, rhythm and style make it more than worth your while. Sokolov is part of the exciting rebirth of the Russian novel, perhaps akin to Victor Pelevin. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RJK6COK1P5GDF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941423077&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lisa Anderson]

http://www.amazon.com/The-Petty-Demon-Fyodor-Sologub/dp/0882338080/[Amazon]

*****
Published just after the turn of the 20th century, Sologub's symbolist masterpiece tells the tale of petty careerist aspirations manifested most predominantly by the paranoid, dull, self-preserving egoist Peredonov. The story itself is widely imbued with mythic allusions and folk references all enshrouded in the thick black-velvet smog of a backwoods black comedy. Peredonov a rural pedagogue, more antagonist than protagonist, but hero all the same, frets only of 'denunciations' and that which will stray his course from its unshakeable aspiration of achieving the rank of town inspector. This version comes with a lengthy, though informative and beneficial in regards to contextualization, introduction by the translator, the author's outrightly humorous forewords to the first editions, a minimal amount of footnotes that inform without being a work of historical nonfiction themselves, appendicized textual variants and a more than significant collection of critical publications in review of the work itself. I must note that the number of silly typos is nearly a distraction unto itself; this version having all the features of the much acclaimed "norton critical editions" of literature classics, it seems such blunders would have been caught. Nevertheless, coming from a Russian literature in specific (and world literature in general) enthuse, this is one of my favorite works of any time period. The style reminds me of Gogol's frolicking absurdity equally parsed with the brooding neurosis of Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov. Recommended on all accounts. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33Q1A0WJW86KX/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0882338080[Bachenstein]

*The Athenian Murders* (2002)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Athenian-Murders-Jose-Carlos-Somoza/dp/0374106770/[Amazon]

*****
"The Cave of Ideas", this book's title in the original Spanish, is actually a far better one; certainly more apt. "The Athenian Murders" doesn't quite bring across the right tone that of a viciously intelligent piece of a philosophy. It more creates the impression of a simple historical whodunit, which is rather misleading. For it is FAR more than that, and anyone who picks up this book just wanting an enjoyable historical novel may find themselves confounded. Because this book is, as that original title suggests, a novel of ideas. It is not just a piece of philosophy, this book IS philosophy.

It's set-up is original and brilliant, leading to the fact that we actually have here TWO first-person narrators. One, Diagoras, is a contemporary of Plato, a pedagogue at his academy in Athens. He is writing an account concerning the brutal murder of one of the sons of a leading Athenian dignitary. His body was found on a wooden hillside, and the condition of the corpse initially leads the discovers to think he has been savaged by wolves. Diagoras calls in the "Decipherer of Enigmas", Heracles Pontor (note the initials!) to help investigate the murder. Our second narrator is the modern-day translator of this ancient Greek manuscript, who speaks to us only through his footnotes as he translates the text. Gradually, as he works, another story appears to be emerging in the writing, buried in layers of hidden meaning. It seems that there is a message beneath the main story, and the unnamed translator grows obsessed by it. The more he translates, the deeper the roots seem to extend, until eventually the astonishing, confounding truth is revealed...

This is probably the most important literary thriller since Donna Tartt's The Secret History, or Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. It won the UK's CWA Gold Dagger for Best Crime Novel of the year, and I don't think there has ever been a more deserving winner. This is the writer's sixth novel, but his English language debut, and it marks out a remarkable, astounding talent. It is incredibly hard to convey the sheer quality of this text (somehow that word seems more appropriate than "novel") is without revealing its brilliance, the stunning, jaw-dropping final revelation which shafts this novel into the stratosphere of brilliant works of literature and ideas. As I say, though this starts as a philosophical novel, with meaning within meaning, with its end it actually BECOMES a genuine piece of actual philosophy itself. It's ending explodes it into the category, "masterpiece". It's definitely a book for the thinking-reader, though, some of the ideas explored take time to get your head around, and I'm sure that the end can provoke hours of thought, cogs turning round and round in the brain. It did for me, certainly. However, there is more to this brilliant mystery than just its end; don't let my effusive praise deceive you!

The historical sections are fascinating, wonderfully detailed; crafted with the love of a scholar. They're not overbearing, though, and they only add to the story and the characters. It's also worth assuring you that Somoza balances the two parallel stories brilliantly. Never is there more importance placed on the truth of the ancient mystery than there is on the truth of the modern one, so effortless does he temper them, balance them. Nor does he allow the interjections of the "translator" to interrupt the flow of the mystery too much. It happens a little, but that is to be expected, I suppose.

This is a brilliant novel of stories within stories, circles within circles. It isn't for you if you like your crime fiction straightforward and cosy (as well as being complex, there are one or two slightly brutal themes), but if you like to be forced to think, then this is the best novel you could have the wisdom to select! - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YFWFP0K7H5PS/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374106770[RachelWalker]

Sorokin, Vladimir

[[The_Queue]]
*The Queue* (2008)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Queue-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172744/[Amazon]

*****
Jean Cocteau wrote that a line is life and that "[w]ith the writer, line takes precedence over form and content." In his first novel, "The Queue", Vladimir Sorokin, takes a different sort of line and manages to have the life of that line take precedence over the form and structure of a traditional novel. The result is a moderate success.

Set in Moscow during the Brezhnev era a random group of strangers form up in a line to purchase some unknown sort of consumer product and spend more than a day waiting in line to purchase the unknown product. The book plays out as a series of random conversations along the line. People come and go, they fight over their place, complain about the sales clerks and the apparatchiks who jump the queue, flirt, sleep, and complain some more. As noted by Sorokin in an afterward to this edition, "an era can be judged by street conversations", and that is exactly what he sets out to do.

The snippets of conversation are funny, ironic, and revealing. They reflect very well, in my opinion, an era in which the desire for consumer goods outweighed the ability of the USSR to produce and sell them. The result was a society in which lines were ubiquitous and an accepted (if grudgingly so) fact of life.

The concept and structure of the book was fascinating to me. The snippets of conversations sounded authentic and were often both humorous and subversive. However, the very structure which made the book sound so intriguing also served to diminish my enjoyment of it. The characters were anonymous and the ebb and flow of conversations were a bit hard for me to track. As often happens when you are on a line you often come into the middle of a conversation, or hear only snatches of it, and can only grasp at the whole meaning. That's not a bad thing and is a natural enough occurrence in `real life'. However, the disjointed nature of the text was a bit jarring to read. I could keep track of the various anonymous characters that pass along the line for the most part but I often found myself scrolling back to place some of the text in context.

I did enjoy reading "The Queue" but I kept thinking as I turned the pages that this is dialogue that would work better on a stage where it can be heard and seen. I think a staged production of this book could be excellent. Ultimately, I think of The Queue as an experiment in form that didn't quite work. However, the writing itself was witty and insightful and did paint a pretty evocative, satiric picture of life in Moscow during what Sorokin (and others) refer to as the period of stagnation. Sorokin's Afterword is a valuable addition to the text and I wonder if it wouldn't serve the reader to be read as a preface rather than an afterword.

I do recommend this book even though I think the work itself would be better performed than read. It does require some concentration but there are enough brilliantly written `snippets' to make the experience worthwhile. I think The Queue would be of particular interest to those with an interest in Soviet literature and history since I think they are more likely to `get' many of the asides and self-referential jokes made in the text. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VXJH30F9IUR/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590172744&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Lonya]

http://www.amazon.com/Day-Oprichnik-Novel-Vladimir-Sorokin/dp/0374533105/[Amazon]

*****
Vladimir Sorokin is worth reading more for political than literary reasons. He is a courageous post-Soviet critic of the authoritarian backsliding and Orwellian fog of the Putin period. His understanding of Russian history and culture is such that he is able to place the Putin regime's nationalistic, xenophobic megalomania into the context to which it belongs. His obvious point is historical continuity between medieval Muscovy and dystopian Putinism. Here, of course, the "oprichnina" with its dog's head and broomtail is a reference back to Ivan the Terrible's thuggish proto-secret police, the oprichnina, "sniffing out" and "sweeping away" seditious enemies, real and imagined, of the paranoid medieval Muscovite despot, just as Sorokin's future set of oprichnik notables are portrayed defending an insular and xenophobic neo-tsarist Kremlin of the first half of the twenty-first century.

Viewed from a slightly different angle, "Oprichnik" is a dystopic projection of the Putin's defensive nostalgia for Holy Russia's anti-Western, authoritarian great power grandeur into the near future. Sorokin's writing relies on moments of raw semi-pornographic references which presumably can be justified as necessary to capture and satirize the hypocrisy of the Putin regime's claim to be the global protector of conservative morality and tradition. What we see is a satirical jeering at the ugly marriage of Russian Orthodoxy and anti-Western puritanical bigotry which has become characteristic of the Putin regime, an ideological replacement for the loss of Marxism-Leninism.

In the mid-19th century Tocqueville warned the West, "Today Russia says 'I am Christianity.' Tomorrow Russia will say, 'I am socialism." Back to square one: In Sorokin's satire Russia is "Holy" once again, and that holiness expresses itself in authoritarianism, xenophobia, hypocrisy, corruption, and sexual license.

Sorokin is a capable writer, but politically more significant than impressive as a Russian man of letters. Still his satire often hits the mark. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2178PQEKS9L3Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374533105&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[ORR]

http://www.amazon.com/Mulligan-Stew-Novel-Gilbert-Sorrentino/dp/1564780872/[Amazon]

*****
In the course of its 450 odd pages, Gil Sorrentino's aptly titled Mulligan Stew manages to embrace nearly every one of the flaws and shortcomings cited by various publishing house editors in the collection of rejection notices that he serves up as a kind of ironic prologue to the novel itself. Or are the letters part and parcel of the novel itself? Or is it a novel? Beats the hell out of me.

Yes, it's too long. Yes, it reads like an incoherent goulash of unrelated bits and scraps of ideas which seem to have been jettisoned from previous experiments during the revision and editing process. And the mystic caverns of technique he drags us down into have already been illuminated and thoroughly mapped out by the likes of Barth, Sukenick, Queneau, Robbes-Grillet and company. The characters are cardboard cut-outs and the dialogue flops back and forth between dull cliches and stagey pretentiousness. But wait. Sorrentino has created only one character, a disintegrating hack named Lamont, who exists in a frenzied denial of his failure as a writer. It's Lamont who's responsible for all that purple prose. Right? His work in progress is so bad that his characters begin to plot an escape just to distance themselves from the awful dialogue he keeps putting in their mouths. But that must be Sorrentino's doing. Right?

Are we being offered a window on the punishing battering a writer's psyche must endure as he goes into battle to defend the integrity of his craft against the evil philistines of the commercial publishing industry? Or is Sorrentino just putting a good one over on us while cleaning out his old notebooks? I don't know. The damn thing is diabolical. But it sure was great fun to read. And, really, isn't that enough? - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16L71PI7DLICE/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564780872[A Customer]

Damn, this is a funny book! Sorrentino subverts the Western novel with a ludicrous tale of hunting for gold narrated entirely in interrogative sentences. Reminiscent in some ways of the boys' novel parody in "Misterioso," Sorrentino has a field day with the traditions and lingo of the Western, as well as going off on riffs concerning contemporary culture. Throughout, Sorrentino interrogates our use of language, especially our reliance on cliches; a linguistic hygienist, Sorrentino questions any sloppy misuse of language, knowing that sloppy language can lead to sloppy thinking. The Western genre has attracted many innovative writers--Coover, Brautigan, Kesey, even William Gaddis wrote a Western screenplay, unfortunately never produced--but Sorrentino's inquisitorial contribution is the funniest. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R1QGL4V9Q3VFDV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1892295679&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Steven Moore]

*****
""Flash and Filigree" is like nothing you'll ever read. Satirist, Terry Southern's first novel is one wild ride into the realms of insanity and obsession. The story begins with a head-scratcher of a meeting between a Doctor and a Patient, and soon has them in a game of cat and mouse in the streets of 1950's Los Angelas. I loved the way in which Southern toys with the reader: Who's crazy? Who's insane? Who's paranoid? Who's obsessed with who? Who's following who? Southern is relentless! I think I could do without the story of the nurse, which has nothing to do with the doctor's or the patient's. I also loved some of the supporting characters: The drunken detective, the pot-head bar girl, etc. This book is as sick and bizarre a novel about obsession and paranoia as any book I've read. But what a ride. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recomended. Simply Briliant!" - Former Amazon Customer

[[Blue_Movie]]
*Blue Movie* (1970)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Movie-Terry-Southern/dp/0802134661/[Amazon]

*****
What if a stag film, one of those cheaply made, low-grade film quality adult boff movies, were made with a big budget, with big name stars, at feature film length? That's what Boris Adrian, a.k.a. King B or simply B, a well-respected star director who's won Oscars with his revolutionary and visionary styles who has entered a creative drought for the past two years, wonders aloud to Sidney Krassman, his gross, hefty, and profane producer after an evening spent watching stag films at the home of eccentric, vivacious, multi-handicapped Teeny Marie.

Sid gets three million dollars for production costs. Yes, Boris's movie will be made, but the proviso that it will be filmed and exclusively exhibited in Liechtenstein, that postage stamp sized principality sandwiched between Switzerland and Austria, with the government providing the funding. That would be a boon to a country with the lowest per capita income in Western Europe.

The movie, titled The Faces Of Love, is to be an anthology of erotic love, of twenty-five minute segment stories. Getting the budget money, and production crew is no problem. What about the performers? To that end, Boris procures Angela Sterling, an actress clearly based on Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield, and America's top draw, someone who wants to be seen as more than just a T&A actress, the French lesbian actress Arabella, and prim but pretty British actress Pamela Dickensen. The only big trouble may come from Angela Sterling, who is also the mistress of Les Harrison, vice president of Metropolitan studios, and whose presence on Boris's movie was the result of a breach of contract from a movie funded by Metropolitan. The movie would take advantage of some recently lifted restrictions and challenge some movie taboos, with each story representing a theme such as miscegenation/multiple partners, the first experience, which is a lesbian one, a priest and a hooker, and brother with sister.

As this was written in 1970, four years after the demise of the notorious and increasingly irrelevant Hays Code and two years after the imposition of the MPAA ratings, Blue Movie is well-placed, coming out at the dawn of a brief newfound cinematic freedom.

Sprinkled with lots of four-letter words, mostly by Sid, with plenty of explicit passages and even a few chapters, funny characters such as Feral, a Senegalese extra whose equipment gets many reactions, Tony Sanders, the writer who's a veritable goofy but creative genius, and of course Sid, who's crass, vulgar, but funny. He tells a topless and quite chesty waitress, "Do you have a cold?" When she asks him what makes him think that, he says, "Oh I don't know why. Your chest looks all swollen." Boris's laid back, thoughtful personality makes him a pretty appealing character. The bash at big studios is apparent. Some chapters depict the actual shooting and discussion of scenes in the film, special apparati used in adult scenes, which film buffs may appreciate.

The book ripples with the usual irreverence Southern gives, outdoing The Magic Christian and Candy, two novels that were done as movies.

Which brings me to this: if Blue Movie had been made into a film back in 1970, I'd put Peter Fonda as King B, Vic Tayback (Mel from the Alice series) as Sid, Mamie Van Doren as Alice, Jeanne Moreau as Arabella, and Robert Wagner as Les Harrison. And as Pamela was described as someone resembling Susannah York, why not? And of course change the bummer ending. That'd be something. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RJLM3NAJE8LGH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802134661&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Daniel J. Hamlow]

"In this baroque literary farce, Brazilian author Souza (Death Squeeze, 1992--not reviewed; etc.) employs an elegant, amusing, mock 19th-century style to spin a fabulistic, academic ``sequel of sorts'' to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World. Creating it on the spot in answer to an inane newspaper interview, the narrator shares the plot of his latest project: Jane Challenger, a reporter for a London economics magazine and granddaughter of Doyle's Professor Challenger, discovers--in the jungles of Brazil--a ``reasonably healthy and well-fed species of capitalists considered extinct in England since the eighteenth century.'' Her adventures follow: absurd, intelligent, and entertaining storytelling. While the subject matter might not garner a wide readership, this might be the critical success that brings Souza the recognition his style and imagination clearly deserve." - https://www.amazon.com/Lost-World-II-End-Third/dp/0380898292/[Amazon]

*Zod Wallop* (1995)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Zod-Wallop-William-Browning-Spencer-ebook/dp/B005ZB28TK/[Amazon]

*****
"The inevitable comparison that Zod Wallop brings to mind is to Jonathan Carroll's The Land of Laughs. Both novels revolve around a children's book that is directly affecting the lives of the other characters. The approach that the two authors take to the subject is quite different--Carroll, even in his first novel, drifts around the fantastic, never quite making it real, preferring to define his characters by the world of which we know. Spencer embraces the fantastic, so much so that it is hard sometimes to tell where the "real" world and the fantastic world come together. If one thinks of this balance between the real and the fantastic as a see-saw, in Carroll's world the heavier child is the real world, and vice versa in Spencer.

Harry Gainsborough wrote books for his daughter, Amy. His books were so good that they were published and became well-loved children's books across the world. But when his daughter drowns in a freak accident, he enters into a depression so severe that his agent checks him into a psychiatric ward. In the hospital, the therapist suggests that he write another book--hoping that the creative process will lift him out of despair. Instead, the book that he writes, Zod Wallop, is a bleak, dark novel--the kind of children's book that the Wicked Witch of the West would have written.

Zod Wallop is also Harry Gainsborough's most popular novel, more popular even than Bocky and the Moon Weasels or The Bathtub Wars. Children the world over love Zod Wallop, but none more so than Raymond Story, who read it while a patient at the Harwood Psychiatric Hospital. Raymond, who almost drowned when he was 8, sees his near-death experience as a link to the author of Zod Wallop. Raymond, who when he came across the first draft of Zod Wallop, destroyed the dark, original version that Harry had written. Or had he just hidden the book?

Lastly, William Browning Spencer's Zod Wallop is about the drug, Ecknazine, administered by Marlin Tate to a group of patients at the Harwood Psychiatric who had extremely rich imaginative lives. The goal of Tate's experiment was to enable telepathic communication, but the drug did something else, something much more strange than telepathy. The drug enabled Zod Wallop to come to life.

Spencer's novel is a complex knot of these three stories, moving at a reckless pace towards the conclusion. Zod Wallop is not a predictable book--it steadfastly refuses to toe the line of any one genre, going through thriller, fantasy, horror, science fiction, and mainstream in the course of its pages. I would not call it slipstream either, because it doesn't have a singular consistency of vision. The point is that it works, and in straight comparison to The Land of Laughs, it works better, because it works towards a resolution--one much more rewarding than Carroll's first effort. Spencer still has some honing before his prose is as sharp as Carroll's, specifically the Carroll of Bones of the Moon or After Silence, but Zod Wallop shows that he has the imagination and skills to be in the same league." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUISIQGSQBSRD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312136293[Glen Engel-Cox]

http://www.amazon.com/Men-Jungle-Norman-Spinrad/dp/1490446052/[Amazon]

*****
The story begins centuries in the future where humankind is dispersed throughout the galaxy and war is common. Our protagonist narrowly escapes earth's clutches, carrying nothing but the clothes on his back, his very expensive ship, and a vast fortune in the only currency to have universal utility, drugs.

He ends up on a backward world, where one class of people has enslaved the others, and torture and prostitution is rife. He proceeds to start a civil war, and that's when the book really starts to get interesting. As dark as he is sick and disgusting, Spinrad also manages to do something few writers can, weave together a great story with incredibly realistic characters in an interesting narrative. I'm not sure you'll like any of the main characters, but the story is so fun it matters little. You won't want to put it down, and though you may not like them, you'll really want to know how it all turns out at the end.

Buyers beware, however! This book is incredibly dark. Cannibalism, slavery, prostitution, and murder on a massive and bloody scale are just the beginning. If you enjoy well written sci-fi, then this is your book. Just also know that it is easily the darkest book in the sci-fi, and perhaps any genre, that I have ever come across. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1QSQSAYURBH/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1490446052[M.

*****
Only a few of the previous reviews for this obscure old sci-fi chestnut really tackle its actual themes and points of view. This was Spinrad's second novel and he was still a few releases away from wide recognition, but here he shows some real ambition and creativity. While the book does get a little full of itself at times, and the rather wooden characters show the golden age sci-fi weakness of talking way too much, Spinrad spun a surprisingly unique and effective political focus into an otherwise typical little space opera. The story revolves around a quite fascinating philosophy of chaos as the natural state of the universe (and its inhabitants), with the order imposed by leaders as antithetical to the destiny of mankind. It's a rather anarchist political outlook presented in cosmological terms. Spinrad does well with this premise, plotting out some intricate political shenanigans as three different parties exploit each other while trying to impose their vision of humanity, with dueling strategies for creating order or chaos. In the process, Spinrad delivers some insightful ruminations on power, tyranny, and freedom - and what those seemingly cut-and-dried terms mean on a cosmic scale. While parts of this book are pretty outdated and it shows many of the minor weaknesses of its genre at the time, Spinrad delivered what might be the most ambitious sci-fi political exploration this side of Frank Herbert or Anthony Burgess. The fact that this ambition actually leads to readable results is all the reason to pick up this old lost classic if you come across it. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UXLO13S9MVPK/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1490400605[doomsdayer520]

[[The_Iron_Dream]]
*The Iron Dream* (1972)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/1902002164/[Amazon]

*****
Ostensibly THE IRON DREAM was written by one Adolph Hitler, who, rather than remaining in Europe and starting WW 2, emigrated to the United States in 1919 and made a career as an artist and writer of science-fiction. It concerns the career of one Feric Jaggar on a far-future Earth, where only he and his great weapon, The Steel Commander, stand between what remains of humanity and its annihilation at the hands of the evil Dominators and the mutant hordes they control. Reading it, one's first reaction is that if the Museum of Bad Art had a literary wing, this book would be in it, because it is a book "too bad to be ignored." But then, about a quarter of the way in, one begins to see the strong parallels between the fictional career of Feric Jaggar and the actual career of Adolph Hitler and his Nazi followers -- allowing, of course, for the fact that wish-fulfillment on the part of author Hitler makes the book's ultimate denouement rather different than the turns history actually took as a result of politician Hitler's impact on it. By about halfway in, one begins to notice another set of parallels: that between the style and subject of this book and those of a great deal of the less reputable output of the science-fiction community over the years -- and the mind-set of so many of s-f fans, who gobble up that output with the mindless enthusiasm of a horse going at a bin full of oats. At that point it is crystal-clear that this book is a masterful send-up of all that's wrong with the culture of science-fiction, as well as a psychohistorical tour de force that reveals in all its appalling chaos the workings of the mind of one of history's most famous psychopaths, Adolph Hitler. Spinrad never loses control here for even a moment. A truly wonderful read for those who appreciate history and love the best in science-fiction, rather than its worst, this is even better than his THE MEN IN THE JUNGLE, which has to be among the fifty best works of science-fiction ever written. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELAQ5VCLVLB/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1902002164&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Yael Dragwyla]

*****
Imagine Potocki's grimly fantastic The Saragossa Manuscript (1804) comically rewritten by William Goldman in the manner of The Princess Bride (1973), or perhaps infused with the spirit of Monty Python, and you'll have some idea of the giddy, fizzy buzz supplied by Starrett's first novel, a historical fantasia spanning the years 1483 to the author's present, and revolving around a magical bottled draught from the Fountain of Youth.

World traveler, war correspondent and latter-day recluse, Starrett (1886-1974) was a consummate man of letters, writing large quantities of fiction, essays and journalism. But his erudition never interfered with his wit. Incredibly well-read, he incorporated many of his beloved fictional characters and his favorite historical personages into his sprightly secret history.

A dying François Villon gives a pre-fame Christopher Columbus vague hints about the legendary Fountain of Youth on the fabled island of Bimini. That one alluring whisper is all it takes to propel this episodic novel across the centuries, as various immortality-seekers---from Ponce de Leon to Cyrano de Bergerac to Rabelais to Alexander Pope---seek, first, the Fountain itself, and then, when it's found and lost, a vial containing a few precious drops of its waters. The ultimate chapter, set in the twentieth century, effectively disposes of the much-handled vial in an unforeseen, hilarious manner.

Mixing literary icons such as the Three Musketeers and Don Quixote on the same stage with more well-documented folks, Starrett presaged a free-and-easy postmodernism. This oftentimes Blaylockian novel merits Peter Ruber's description as "one of the great under-appreciated fantasies of this century." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2001/cur0108.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

"HERE'S ONE of the most bizarre fiction books ever written: unconventional in structure and in form as well as in premise. I say "fiction book" rather than "novel," because the chapters of How Like a God are interwoven with segments of a seemingly unrelated short story, and the threads unite only in the terrifying conclusion.

The short story, printed entirely in italics but otherwise told in conventional third-person narration, is divided into segments lettered A through Q. These reveal the thoughts of one Mr. Lewis as he ascends a staircase with a pistol in his coat pocket, intending to kill someone in an upstairs room. Lewis's sense of impending doom raises the possibility that perhaps his intent is not murder but rather suicide, or perhaps both.

Alternating between these brief cliffhanger segments are the long chapters I through XVI of a novel, in second-person narration. You are William Barton Sidney. Your entire existence, from childhood through sexual awakening into prosperous middle age, is recounted in these pages. Your life is respectable, normal, prosaic. Yet nobody suspects that you are aware of multiple personalities within your body, and that your head is full of voices.

The final segment Q is a chilling climax, revealing Lewis's intended prey (human in visage only), the true relationship between Lewis and Sidney, and the full significance of the novel's title (a quote from Hamlet). Can it be coincidence that Brenda Clough's 1997 SF novel How Like a God features a telepathic protagonist also named Lewis?" - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2008/cur0801.htm[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]

*****
This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).

This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: "The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.

Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.

"In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.

"Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.

"Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CPUW9QIZYQYS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226778959&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bob Ross]

*****
"I, Libertine was a literary hoax novel that began as a practical joke by late-night radio raconteur Jean Shepherd.
Shepherd was annoyed at the way bestseller lists were compiled in the mid-1950s. These lists were determined from sales figures and from the number of requests for new and upcoming books at bookstores. Shepherd urged his listeners to enter bookstores and ask for a non-existent book. He fabricated the author (Frederick R. Ewing) of this imaginary novel, concocted a title (I, Libertine), and outlined a basic plot for his listeners to use on bookstore clerks. Fans of the show took it further, planting references to the book and author so widely, demand for the book led to its inclusion on The New York Times Best Seller list. 

Bookstores became interested in carrying Ewing's novel, which allegedly had been banned in Boston. When publisher Ian Ballantine, novelist Theodore Sturgeon, and Shepherd met for lunch, Ballantine hired Sturgeon to write a novel based on Shepherd's outline. Betty Ballantine completed the final chapter after Sturgeon fell exhausted asleep on the Ballantines' couch, having tried to meet the deadline in one marathon typing session. On September 13, 1956, Ballantine Books published I, Libertine simultaneously in hardcover and paperback editions with Shepherd seen looking as dissolute as possible, as Ewing, in the back cover author's photograph. The proceeds were donated to charity.[1]

A few weeks before publication, The Wall Street Journal exposed the hoax, already an open secret.

The front cover displays a quote: "'Gadzooks,' quoth I, 'but here's a saucy bawd!'". The cover painting by Frank Kelly Freas includes hidden images and inside jokes: The sign on the tavern, Fish & Staff, has a shepherd's staff and an image of a sturgeon, referencing both Sturgeon and Shepherd. A portion of the word often spoken on the air by Shepherd – "Excelsior!" – can be seen on the paperback cover in a triangular area at extreme left, where it is part of the decoration on the coach door. The hardcover dust jacket, with more of the illustration to the left, shows the entire word." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Libertine[Wikipedia]

*****
Considered an eerie attack on realism, when first published in 1934, Miklós Szentkuthy's debut novel Prae so astonished Hungarian critics that many deemed it monstrous, derogatorily referred to Szentkuthy as cosmopolitan, and classified him alien to Hungarian culture. Incomparable and unprecedented in Hungarian literature, Prae compels recognition as a serious contribution to modernist fiction, as ambitious in its aspirations as Ulysses or À la recherche du temps perdu. With no traditional narration and no psychologically motivated characters, in playing with voices, temporality, and events, while fiction, Prae is more what Northrop Frye calls an anatomy (à la Lucian, Rabelais, & Burton) or Menippean satire: the basic concern of the book is intellectual, its pervading mood is that of a comedy of ideas. As a virtual novel that preempts every possibility for its realization, it is a novel but only virtually so, a book which is actually a prae-paration for an unwritten (unwritable) novel. In this, it maintains the freedom and openness of its potentialities, indicative for instance in the Non-Prae diagonals, a series of passages that intercut the novel and continually fracture space and time to engage in what one of the figures of the book calls the culture of wordplay or dogmatic accidentalism. "The book's title," said Szentkuthy, "alludes to it being an overture. A multitude of thoughts, emotions, ideas, fantasies, and motifs that mill and churn as chimes, an overture to my subsequent oeuvre." By challenging the then prevailing dogmas and conventions of prose writing, Szentkuthy was said to have created a new canon for himself but later derided as insignificant for supposedly not acquiring followers. Largely unread at the time, Prae eventually gained cult status and would be reprinted in 1980 and 2004. To some critics, the book is not only one of the representative experimental works of the early 20th century, but in its attempt to bring 'impossible literature' into being, it also presages the nouveau roman by almost 30 years. And in its rejection of sequentiality and celebration of narrative shuffling, long before Burroughs & Gysin, Prae enacts what is conceptually akin to the cut-up. Few of Szentkuthy's contemporaries would reveal with equal bravura and audacity the new horizons that were opened up for narrative forms after the era of realism. In Frivolities & Confessions, Szentkuthy said that his goal with Prae was "to absorb the problems of modern philosophy and mathematics into modern fashion, love, and every manifestation of life." Translated for the first time since its original publication in 1934, upon its 80th anniversary, this legendary and controversial Hungarian modernist novel is now at last available in English. - https://www.amazon.com/Prae-Vol-1-Miklos-Szentkuthy/dp/1940625084/[Amazon blurb]

*****
Unique in Hungarian literature, at the time of its first appearance in 1935, Towards the One & Only Metaphor was greeted with plaudits by such leading Hungarian critics as László Németh, András Hevesi, and Gábor Halász, with Németh declaring: "Szentkuthy's invention has the merit that he pries writing open in an entirely original manner. . . Where everything was wobbling the writer either joins the earth-shaping forces, or else he sets up his culture-building laboratory over all oscillations. Seated in his cogitarium, even in spite of himself, Szentkuthy is brother to the bellicose on earth in the same way as a cloud is a relative to a plow in its new sowing work." Szentkuthy referred to this nearly unclassifiable text as a Catalogus Rerum, "an index that is of entities and phenomena, a Catalogue of Everything in the Entire World." In a sequence of 112 shorter and longer passages, Szentkuthy has recorded his experiences and thoughts, reflected on his reading matter as well as political, historical, and erotic events, moving from epic subjectivity to ontological actualities: "Two things excite me: the most subjective epic details and the ephemeral trivialities of my most subjective life, in all their own factual, unstylized individuality - and the big facts of the world in their allegorical, Standbild-like grandiosity: death, summer, sea, love, gods, flowers." Similar in kind to the ruminative waste books of Lichtenberg and the journals of Joubert, while Towards the One and Only Metaphor is a fragmentary text, at the same time, it is ordered, like a group of disparate stars which, when viewed from afar, reveal or can be perceived to form a constellation - they are sculpted by a geometry of thought. Szentkuthy conjures up and analyzes spectacle and thought past and present with sensitivity, erudition, and linguistic force. As András Keszthelyi observed, the text is essentially something of a manifesto, "an explicit formulation of the author's intentions, his scale of values, or, if you wish: his ars poetica." Through dehumanization, Szentkuthy returns us to the embryo and the ornament, but so as to bring us into the very particles of existence. Towards the One and Only Metaphor is also a confessional, a laying bare of the heart, even through masks, but in moving beyond the torpid self-obsession that rules our age, Szentkuthy's revelations yield forth the x-ray of a typus, and like Montaigne and Rousseau, he is equally revealing, entertaining, and humorous. Now available in English for the first time, Towards the One & Only Metaphor is destined to stand as one of the principal works of world literature of the 20th century. - https://www.amazon.com/Towards-Only-Metaphor-Miklos-Szentkuthy/dp/1940625009/[Amazon blurb]

*****
Marginalia on Casanova, the first volume of the St. Orpheus Breviary, is Miklos Szentkuthy's synthesis of 2,000 years of European culture. St. Orpheus is Szentkuthy's Virgil, an omniscient, poet who guides us not through hell, but through all of recorded history, myth, religion, and literature, albeit reimagined as St. Orpheus metamorphosizes himself into kings, popes, saints, tyrants, and artists. At once pagan and Christian, Greek and Hebrew, Asian and European, St. Orpheus is a mosaic of history and mankind in one supra-person and veil, an endless series of masks and personae, humanity in its protean, futural shape, an always changing function of discourse, text, myth, & mentalite. Through St. Orpheus' method, disparate moments of history become synchronic, are juggled to reveal, paradoxically, their mutual difference and essential similarity. "Orpheus wandering in the infernal regions," says Szentkuthy, "is the perennial symbol of the mind lost amid the enigmas of reality. The aim of the work is, on the one hand, to represent the reality of history with the utmost possible precision, and on the other, to show, through the mutations of the European spirit, all the uncertainties of contemplative man, the transiency of emotions and the sterility of philosophical systems." Marginalia on Casanova relives the despiritualization of the main protagonist's sensual adventures, though it is less his sex life & more his intellectual mission, the sole determinant of his being, which is the focus of this mesmeric book. Through his own glittering associations and broadly spanning array of metaphors, Szentkuthy analyses and views the 18th century and its notion of homogeneity from the vantage point of the 20th century, with the full armor of someone who was, perhaps, one of the last Hungarian Europeans. While a commentary on Casanova's memoirs, it is also Szentkuthy's very own philosophy of love. Passion, playfulness, irony, and a whole gamut of protean metamorphoses are what characterize Marginalia on Casanova, a work in which readers will experience both profundity and a taking to wing of essay-writing that is intellectually radiant and which is as sensual and provocative as a gondola ride with Casanova.

http://www.amazon.com/Crandolin-Anna-Tambour/dp/1907681191/[Amazon]

*****
It's hard - if not impossible - to categorize this book. It seems to pull its inspiration from so many sources - historic cook books, novels like the Arabian Nights, Travels with a donkey, and a train trip across Russia that neither stops nor ends.

I'd call it part-travelogue, part romance, observing as it does that love comes in so many different packages, part whimsy, part indulgent delve into ancient recipe books, and almost part holy quest as people seek for what they do not have and perhaps do not need.

Tambour draws all her characters perfectly and precisely, and has an uncanny knack of leaving the story and directly addressing the audience, as a travel guide will do to direct your attention to a vital detail or experience you may have otherwise missed. More than once I wondered if the author was setting her own past travel adventures in fiction. I especially loved the absurdity and the humour woven throughout Crandolin. Packed with exquisite moments of description or observation that show the depth and talent of this author, its beautifully written, beautifully produced, and an absolute pleasure to read. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RBPNLNZ7H4PIP/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907681191&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[E.

*Musrum* (1968)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Musrum-Eric-Thacker/dp/022461472X/[Amazon]

*****
 "There was little excuse for the invention of the name MUSRUM. It was already known in sixteen principalities and native states."

Thacker's and Earnshaw's quirky, surreal, and very English fantasy introduces trickster hero Musrum with a barrage of gnomic aphorisms. "A torpedoed cathedral sinks rapidly into the earth." Likewise, "Sudden prayers make God jump." Bizarre lists abound.

A godlike eccentric, Musrum constructs his refuge (which is also the world) downward from the Attic, floor by floor to the Cellar. Musroid symbology is extensive and peculiar; the Giant Mushroom, heart of our man's power, is fatally coveted by the evil Weedking. The resulting pursuit leads to Russia, a plethora of wolves, a Musrum doppelganger called Palfreyman, and the Second Crimean War.

Besides its elegant, witty prose, Musrum is a graphic novel profusely illustrated by both authors, with many Escherian quirks. Musrum's iron castle has two linked sections, the Side Elevation and the Ground Plan. Vital strategies depend on a map revealing the Volga river to be circular. Skulls and crossbones recur. There are exhaustive diagrammatic inventories of war banners, final victory celebrations, and dressing tables (57 varieties).

Sample campaign tactic: "Exploiting the concept of gravity, Musrum designed and constructed a perpetual motion machine which was simply a four-wheeled bogie. He placed this casual device on a hill that sloped down forever."

This book's weird, one-off inventiveness made it impossible—after Musrum's triumphant return to his kingdom of Intersol—for there to be a sequel. The 1971 sequel is equally deranged, drastically reworks the story of that very bad man Father Christmas, and is called Wintersol. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2002/cur0206.htm[David Langford]

*****
I read Tiffany Thayer's Dr. Arnoldi for the last time when I was fifteen years old.

Why for the last time? I found the book absolutely fascinating---and disgusting. I read it as I then read most such science-fantasy works, in stand-up sessions in my neighborhood rental-library bookstore. I couldn't afford the rental fees, so I used the place as my personal library, working my way through Robert Chambers and Arthur Machen.

If I found it at all fascinating, why haven't I bought a copy to reread? Well, first you get online and try to order something by Thayer. Tiffany who? Thayer (1902-1959), rather famous in the 1930s for his brilliantly ironic Thirteen Men, Thayer, the great publicist of Charles Fort---Thayer today resides in literature's limbo.

And there are those alive today who've also read Dr. Arnoldi, who say that's exactly what the s.o.b. deserves. You see, it's a novel that deals only with death. Or rather, with the upsetting absence of death.

For some reason, never explained, death has stopped. Nobody can die anymore. There's a very dear little scene, for instance, in an execution chamber where a condemned man, electrocuted to no avail several dozen times, is---out of sheer judicial desperation---chopped up and then ground into human hamburger. The pile of hamburger goes on pulsating, utterly undead.

Sex? There's lots in the book, for sex never takes a single holiday. The human population keeps expanding over every square inch of earth, down to the unlit bottoms of the sea, up to the thinnest level of the stratosphere, humanity without end, chewing on itself. Thayer ends the novel with an understandable plea to every deity from Adonis to Zeus, "...the next time You have an idea like this to give away, You send it to H. G. Wells, because I won't bother with it."

Which is almost the way I've felt about the book, since I read it so many years ago. If you ever find a copy, give it to some sf fan you dislike. Your reward will be the baffled misery in his eyes after he's read it. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/1998/cur9808.htm[William Tenn]

This is the first U.S. publication of two riotous novels by the Polish-born British writer Stefan Themerson (1910-1988), who with his wife Franciszka ran the Gaberbocchus Press in London. Gaberbocchus published both Kurt Schwitters and Bertrand Russell - and these extremes unite in Themerson's highly individual brand of philosophical Dadaism. Bayamus recounts the adventures of a self-proclaimed mutant with three legs (one is attached to a roller skate) and his efforts to propogate a new species; it includes an instructive visit to the "Theatre of Semantic Poetry," where old rhymes mutate into new truths. Cardinal Polatuo is the biography of Apollinaire's anonymous father, who turns out to be a ecclesiast with a murderous interest in poetry, a faith based on science, and a dreamlife so frankly obscene that only a dictionary of Freudian symbols can explain its innocence. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1878972219/[Amazon boilerplate]

Hobson's Island (so called because Mr. Hobson bought it, or did Mr. Hobson buy it because it was so called?) enjoyed decades of isolation in the Atlantic Ocean.

But all is suddenly disrupted when a wave of unusual visitors arrive: a deposed African king fleeing a revolution, a Hobson descendant claiming ownership, government agents eyeing the nation-less real estate, and scientists looking to test a dangerous new invention. In typical Themerson fashion, the comic is wound up with the serious and let go to devastating effect. A clever and apt parodying of Cold War power plays and twisted science, Hobson's Island is a strangely touching, sympathetic, and emotional account of the families and individuals brought together and broken up by Hobson's Island. - http://www.amazon.com/Hobsons-Island-British-Literature-Themerson/dp/1564784177/[Amazon boilerplate]

http://www.amazon.com/Collected-Tales-Long-Peter-Tinniswood/dp/0091501407/[Amazon]

*****
Tall tales with a poker-face or stereotypical stiff-upper lip. Peter Tinniswood's cricket yarns are short, reflective, ruminations by the occasionally bewildered old man, called the Brigadier (a military rank, perhaps, or just a British equivalent of the Americans' habit of addressing respected elderly men as "Colonel") for whom the world is utterly cricket -- and very funny.

The Brigadier is a long-time resident of the quaint little Saxon village Whitney Scrotum.

(Incidentally, the pictures at the head of each chapter progressively show the Brigadier, in canvas deck-chair, watching a match slowly passing. There is a silent story just in those pictures!)

Tinniswood's sense of humour resembles, perhaps, Michael Palin's "Ripping Yarns": an everyday setting is tweaked just a little beyond the everyday and suddenly becomes disturbingly, hilariously, excessive. This is a mild form of surrealism.

Other comparisons, within science-fiction or fantasy contexts, are the delicious extremes of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. The beloved BBC radio "Goon Shows", with their own unique and anarchic humour of the late, great Spike Milligan, also spring to mind. The Brigadier resmbles a blend of the "Goon Show"'s Major Bloodnok, and Wodehouse's "Mr Mullinar" -- a purveyor of delicious tall tales, told in a pub over a glass or two.

Much of the humour comes in the Brigadier's attitudes, presented with deadpan take-it-or-leave-it self-confidence.

In the very first story, the Brigadier confides (and the tone throughout the stories is one of taking the reader into genial confidence) that, "During the course of a long and arduous career in the service of king and country I have had the honour in the name of freedom and natural justice to slaughter and maim men(and women) of countless creeds and races ... it is my firm belief that all the victims of this carnage and slaughter were just like you and I -- apart from their disgusting table manners and their revolting appearance".

The Brigadier is like a relic from Kipling's Raj, with a twist.

Another recurring aspect of Tinniswood's humour comes in the way the Brigadier mis-remembers, mashing names, mis-connecting, and generally sounding right while being wildly off-target.

"Now as I approach the twilight of my life I look back with pleasure and pride on those campaigns which have brought me so much comfort and fulfilment -- crushing the Boers at Aboukir Bay, biffing the living daylights out of the Turk at the Battle of Rorke's Rift, massacring the Aussies at The Oval in 1938".

This is not funny, unless you realise that Aboukir was about something totally different from the Boers, and there were no Turks at Rorke's Rift, and the massacring of Aussies refers to a famous Ashes cricket Test Match.

Again and again Tinniswood creates perfect names for cricket teams: The Ditherers, the Arab Slavers' Country Eleven, the Coptic Matyrs Eleven, and many others. He also creates bizarre but almost plausible roles for characters, such as the chaplain to Madame Tussauds, and the rugby league correspondent for "The Lancet", and many others.

The Brigadier's world is one of groin protectors, sight screens, leopard-skin cricket bags, scorebooks bound in okapi hide, and, for the Lady Wife, wedding anniversay gifts bought at the shop at Lords (the Marylebone Cricket Club, and the "home" of cricket) -- where else? -- such as the Gubby Allen toilet bag, and the Alec Bedser pyjama case. (It matters nothing that we may not know who Gubby Allen or Alec Bedser are.) As much as the Brigadier bemoans ever having married, he admits that "it was her handiwork with needle and thread which on many occasions has saved me from the distress of having to take a well-loved jock strap to the vet to be put down".

What may add to the enjoyment is realising that, just one or two steps closer to sanity than the Brigadier's own recollections, there really were travelling companies of cricket players, and J.M. Barrie (the author of "Peter Pan" and an extreme eccentric) had a cricket team of famous writers, including A.A. Milne and A.E.W. Mason, and others -- the Allahackberries (as I recall -- the subject of another fascinating book)! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFAUZ55TYGRG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0091501407&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[John Gough]

*The Slynx* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Slynx-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590171969/[Amazon]

*****
"The Slynx", the debut novel by Tatyana Tolstaya, the granddaughter of the Russian writer Alexey Tolstoy, is worth reading. There are many reasons to recommend this book. The first and perhaps most important one is the language - funny, full of neologisms and contrasts, bursting with life; the novel is an excellent satire on the contemporary changes in the language, its simplifications and slang. The second is the atmosphere, as if taken from a painting of a primitivist. The third are its deep roots in Russia, its history and nature, the Russian soul and destiny.

Although obviously possible to classify as a dystopia, "The Slynx" cannot really be compared to any other dystopian novels (I cannot see any resemblance to Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale, except that it is also a dystopia, which is not too much of a similarity), except the other contemporary Russian ones (it seems like the Russian writers have only futuristic visions nowadays) - and from those I have read, I enjoyed "The Slynx" the most. The other association I had was with "The Clockwork Orange", mainly because of the linguistic stylization.

The action takes place in some settlement consisting of bigger and smaller wooden huts (later we learn that it is placed on where Moscow used to be), sometime in the future, after the undefined explosion. The inhabitants are superstitious (their beliefs are wonderfully re-told old Russian folk tales; the novel is full of literary references, to the tales as well as to poetry and prose, which are delightful for the reader), they make all tools of wood, they eat mice and are scared of the slynx, an unseen, mythical creature from the forest, and of the Chechens from the South. They suffer from various mutations, or so-called "Effects" of the explosion. They never read, only praise and fear Fyodor Kuzmich, the absolute ruler, never ask questions and try, like animals, to find their place in the world of poisonous rabbits and other post-explosion deviations. The main protagonist, Benedikt, although raised among the same people and unable to really get out of his environment, has a lot of doubts, sometimes asks inconvenient questions, and reads all the books he can lay his hands on (it does not make him any wiser though, as he falls in love and marries into a rich family, which numbs him almost irreversibly). The society is surprisingly similar to the Russian society (as it is now and as it was throughout the centuries) - there is a grey mass of poor, common people and the few unscrupulous rich, there is also a special degenerated group of people from Old Times, who are used instead of horses to pull sledges (I had a most strange association with taxi drivers at this point) and, finally, The Oldeners, people who survived the Explosion and their Effect is mainly a very long lifespan. The Oldeners long for the old days (who could blame them?), keep secret libraries of forbidden books and try to preserve the old culture, which has deteriorated (their dialogues with the ordinary people cause laughter through the tears), and memories of the past. They speak the normal language of educated people and sometimes are completely clueless and childlike in the Slynx reality (paradoxically, for them, as for us, the rest of the society is childlike and clueless about the world).

There are, of course, obvious parallels to the Russian reality (I do not think that "The Slynx" can be read as a universal dystopia, it is Russian to the core). The Explosion can be explained in several ways, some would see it as Charnobyl, but most likely it is the Great Revolution, Fyodor Kuzmich is a personification of Stalin, and The Oldeners are the old intelligentsia, a class specific for the Communist countries from Eastern Europe.

"The Slynx" is enjoyable, although it is also thoroughly pessimistic and does not give any hope (although, maybe, at the very end, there is a tiny grain of hope for a change). Tatyana Tolstaya has been noted for her nihilism already after the publication of her short stories, and "The Slynx" seems to confirm this thesis. The book could be shorter, though, after a while the language gets a bit tiresome, and the ending is also not its strongest point. - http://www.amazon.com/review/REU1UY8E2TGOL/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171969&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Aleksandra Nita-Lazar]

"A confession: it took me what I now regard as a wastefully long time to get around to reading Swing Hammer Swing!; wastefully because I would probably have managed to read what became my favourite Scottish novel several more times had I not been so foolishly reluctant. The obstacle was one of expectation, created by the terms in which the book had been recommended – ‘it’s about a man’s house in the Gorbals being demolished’; ‘documents the end of an era, the squalor of tenement life and all that’; ‘took 30 years to write’; ‘immense achievement’; ‘ordinary chap, worked in a car factory don'cha know’ – and thoroughly cemented by its winning a major literary award.

I eventually picked it up out of a sense of Glaswegian civic duty, anticipating a dose of grim urban miserablism that would depress Maxim Gorky. Two pages in, I was swiftly disabused of my misconceptions. Five pages in I was reading through tears. Swing Hammer Swing! is the spirit of Glasgow distilled into 400 pages, each tiny drop intoxicating – and thus to be slowly savoured – but you can’t help just necking half the bottle at one go.

There is no story – ‘plots are for cemeteries’ quoth its protagonist – only the meanderings and misadventures of Tam Clay as he awaits the birth of his first child in the final few days before the world he knows is pulled down. I am not going to attempt any kind of summary; suffice it to say this is a book diverse enough to accommodate events such as Tam drunkenly stumbling into a psychopaths’ card-school before inadvertently setting fire to the place, alongside Death paying a fruitless visit to the local public toilet, or Shug Wylie’s Bum Boutique, to give it its correct title.

No novel has ever encapsulated so much of the language, humour, attitude, philosophy, character and restless energy of the dear green place. I love it passionately, though I still maintain the Whitbread judges gave it the nod for two reasons: one, they didn’t get the humour and therefore failed to disqualify it for the literary high crimes of being funny and entertaining; and two, it being the early 90s, they thought the more bizarre passages were actually a Scottish equivalent of Latin American magical realism, rather than merely an accurate depiction of Glasgow on any given Saturday night." - https://www.list.co.uk/article/2814-jeff-torrington-swing-hammer-swing-1992/[The List]

*****
""The Devil's Carousel" was first published in 1996 and is a collection of short stories based around the Centaur Car Company's plant in Glasgow . Each story follows a different lead character, from the shopfloor right up to senior management - though one story's lead character does, occasionally, play a bit part in another story. The plant is not presented as a pleasant place to work - industrial injuries are clearly common enough, while the number of heart attacks and strokes has led to the local hospital naming a ward in the company's honour. There's even the occasional nervous breakdown...

Things in the plant run far from smoothly, and there is a slightly antagonistic relationship between the management and the workforce. The working conditions clearly don't take the workforce's best interests into account, though the grievances are probably nurtured by the shop stewards. (KIKBAK, a very unofficial and clued-in newssheet probably doesn't help either, and several articles also appear in the book). However, the management don't do themselves any favours : they keep themselves so far above the shopfloor, they are widely known as the Martians. (Only one Martian, Mal Kibbley, earns a starring role in one of the stories. The Martians are keen to build a top-of-the-range car, though they want it built without the workforce kept in the dark about it...accordingly, when the workforce find out what the Marians are trying to pull, they'll do everything the can to sabotage this perfect car's production). Unsurprisingly, the plant is rumoured to be in some trouble with the company's head office believed to be considering job cuts. Having said that, there are suggestions - as the book progresses - that the Bilbao plant is in a little more danger.

Most of the stories are about the ordinary workers - not the big picture - with each story having a different character taking the lead. (However, one story's lead character may, occasionally, pop up as another ctory's supporting character from time to time). There are a few stories that see characters die or suffer from breakdowns, which isn't too surprising given the health problems widely suffered by the workforce. One of the book's more memorable survivors, however, is Curley Brogan - such an effective shop steward that the Martians are actually afraid of him. However, since his personal hygiene leaves a lot to be desired, his colleagues aren't overly fond of him either. Curley isn't one of the characters who die - however, he decides to have a little fun for a day or two by 'faking' his own death...a plan that, naturally, causes him a little bother.

However, nobody can find anything good to say aboutTwitcher Haskins - another string character. Twitcher - the nickname comes from the fact he's a keen birdwatcher - is a very petty individual and the plant's Security Chief. (The plant's security officers are known, colloquially, as the snipes - as the Security Chief, Twitcher is also known as the Supersnipe). Naturally, he has an arch-nemesis - the Magpie - who is responsible for all major acts of pilfering in the plant...and there's nothing Twitcher would like better than to cap his retirement with the Magpie's capture..." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYM8VJ4Y54I9W/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151002479[Craobh Rua]

[[The_Fetishist]]
*The Fetishist* (1984)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tournier was a 'hot' writer in the 70s and 80s and all his work remains in print and in translation. My French isn't up to assessing the quality of this translation, but the prose seems sensuous and discreet, the work of a particularly precise and practical mind. 'The Fetishist' is a collection of short stories, each playfully perverting any whiff of inevitability. Tournier's deadly wit is evident in equal measure throughout, though,'Prickly','The Red Dwarf','The Woodcock','Death and the Maiden,and,'Lily of the Valley Lay-by' especially enchant. If you haven't read the weightier works, you have a treat in store. But these fabulous tales will set you in the Tournier meter. Surreal? Yes, for all their formal structure and classic allusions, their beguiling surfaces are determined to deceive. Not through the verbal or linguistic collisions of surrealistic poetry, but in the polished inversions of the 'rational' found in Magritte and Ernst. Tournier's dense but balletic footwork has kinship with Umberto Ecco's fiction. For all the sexual darkness that permeates Tournier's ouvre, there is also what he defines as,'white humour', a marriage of the cosmic with the comic. It's an apt definition of what I find contagious about his writing, extending even to his excellent autobiography,'The Wind Spirit'. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R23AI8OOF501ZW/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385153546&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[R.

Tusser was a small farmer in Suffolk in the late 16th century who wrote a very long poem in rhyming couplets about farming and rural housekeeping. No one in their right mind would read Tusser for his literary merit but there are local pleasures. Tusser's 10 common faults attributable to cheese is a justly famous list and the verses are a fund of anecdotes on how people filled their bellies. But it is terribly dull. - http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/19/lawrence-norfolk-top-10-food-books[Lawrence Norfolk]

*****
"IN THIS parody collection's supernatural frame-story, the afterlife comprises 976 heavens, many with literary themes. New to Limbo and bewildered by choice, our nameless protagonist samples the heavens of five authors—three still remembered for sf/fantasy:

"The Heaven of Queer Stars" opens with vertiginous dazzles of prose, just like a G. K. Chesterton landscape description with the volume turned to eleven. Against a background of vast celestial pantomime, eternal bliss means Chesterton's favorite pastime of debate. His Father Brown-like mouthpiece brilliantly out-argues a Mephistophelian adversary resembling GKC's old sparring partner Bernard Shaw, whose protests are swamped by the incoming flood of paradoxical rhetoric. It's Chesterton at his most exhausting.

"The Heaven of the Time-Machine" pokes fun at H. G. Wells as eternal proponent of Science, Progress, and Utopia, of a glorious twenty-first century where "corners and all dust-collecting angles had long since vanished from architecture." Alas, when the Time Machine ("the incessant typewriter") shifts our hero to the year 5,320,506, he finds thermic-electron-clad post-humans telepathically deploring the grubby present day and dreaming of future Utopia.…

The best spoof is "The Heaven Above Storysende," gently mocking James Branch Cabell's style and trick of disguising verse as prose. After "certain adventures which are rather more unmentionable than not," the Heaven-seeking quest hero launches into increasingly strained rhyming speeches whose invariable refrain is: "For I am Ortnitz and I follow after the unattainable end." Cabell himself praised this "damnable cleverness."

The nonfantastic parodies, with poets tackling Einstein's relativity, are also fun." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2012/cur1211.htm[David Langford]

*****
"Prankish, witty, absurd and horrifying. This book is a collection of mostly previously-published material gathered together in a single volume, all about the imaginary city of Ambergris. The various items are interlocking, cross-referential, and together they build up a mythology, a history, a culture of this vividly conceived fantasy world. The first half, "The Book of Ambergris" contains four novellas:

"Dradin, In Love" is a surreal tale about a missionary returning from the jungle, becoming obsessed with a woman he sees in a window, and enlisting the aid of a reprehensible dwarf to help him woo her. The story spirals into madness and an alarming degree of violence. Themes introduced here recur in other stories throughout the book (dwarves seem to be an obsession, along with squid and fungus), as well as a surprising revelation as to who the narrator actually is...
"The Hoegbotton Guide to the Early History of Ambergris" is exactly what the title implies - a history of Ambergris written by Duncan Shriek (who turns out to be important in the novel _Finch_ .. which I read first.) It is filled with snarky & hilarious footnotes which hint at another story which the author knows but is not telling...
"The Transformation of Martin Lake" tells an eerie story of events surrounding the death of the great Ambergris composer Voss Bender as they relate to a painter named Martin Lake. The story is interspersed with excerpts from an art-historical/critical essay about Lake's paintings, written by gallery curator Janice Shriek (sister of historian Duncan Shriek.) VanderMeer's ability to ape the art-historian's academic writing style is impressive.
"The Strange Case of X" is an internally self-referential story narrated in first and third person (by the same character) about a writer imprisoned within his own fictional world.

The second half of the book is the "AppendiX" which contains an assortment of short stories, notes, letters and pamphlets (including a glossary of Ambergris and a hilarious treatise on the subject of giant freshwater squid) supposedly left behind by X sometime after the events described in "The Strange Case of X." By turns funny and gruesome, these collected fragments build up the mythology of Ambergris.

Rarely have I seen an imaginary world so completely and meticulously conceived. Most are only as detailed as the immediate story requires, so I had no idea Ambergris had this much legitimate depth to it. Having read _Finch_ first (and therefore already knowing what the fungoid "gray caps" are planning) did not diminish my enjoyment. In fact, probably knowing that there was a point to all of this increased my enjoyment. Otherwise what we have here is an extended exercise in world-building. The stories, taken individually, are interesting .. cumulatively they are impressive .. but in a narrative sense they lead nowhere. This book lays the groundwork for the subsequent Ambergris novels, _Shriek: An Afterword_ and _Finch_. In itself, considering its nature as a collection of short works, it has no overarching plot - which may frustrate some readers. But there are threads that tie all of this material together.

VanderMeer is a chameleon, able to mimic a variety of literary voices & styles. This book is a veritable puzzle-box full of clever tricks, self-referential pranks and hoaxery, vivid description and narrative irony .. His prose sparkles, giving the impression of complete control while leaving much to deduce & infer. _City of Saints and Madmen_ requires some patience from the reader but I found it immensely rewarding. Seldom do I find a book both witty AND disturbing. I will count it among my favorites from now on." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RON0ANRQPYG04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553383574[J. W. Kennedy]

*****
This book is a treasure. Mr. Van Dyke obviously has the soul of a poet, and within his graceful prose he paints vivid and soul-stirring pictures of some of the most beautiful places on earth. He describes in fine detail observations he made on a long trip, on horseback in 1898/99, over, around, and through the lower deserts of Arizona and California. He leaves no stone unturned as he describes the magnificence and beauty of each aspect of the desert, and pulls no punches in his criticism of man's destructive intrusions. To Van Dyke, the play of light and shadow, the star-pocked night skies, the ragged and jagged ranges of mountains, the perfectly adapted plants and animals, the sometimes shifting sands, and the silent river barrier known as the Colorado are each part of the unique sum which is, in its own harsh and angular way, a paradise of color, form, and life: "The Desert."

Speaking as one who has lived on and wandered through this same desert for nearly forty years, I can attest to the accuracy of Van Dyke's physical descriptions and, perhaps more importantly, I can note that I've found here both the magic and the majesty which he so ably describes. Still, this isn't a book for everyone. Those who prefer the gleam of glass towers and the roar of jet planes to flaming sunsets and yapping coyotes, save your money. Van Dyke wrote, "Not in the spots of earth where plenty breeds indolence do we meet with the perfected type. It is in the land of adversity ... that finally emerges the highest manifestation."

He was right, and he leaves us "The Desert" as evidence. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PV6JLVGQB1LX/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=087905395X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[PL Nelson]

Verissimo, Luis Fernando

[[Borges_and_the_Eternal_Orangutans]]
*Borges and the Eternal Oranguans* (2005)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081121592X/[Amazon]

*****
In Edgar Allan Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" (considered the first true entry in the genre of detective fiction), Auguste Dupin and his unnamed narrator-sidekick investigate the double-murder of a mother and daughter, who are heard screaming and, almost immediately after, are discovered mauled to death in a fourth-story room that is locked from the inside. Eventually the sleuths uncover the truth: the "murders" were committed by a frightened orangutan, freshly escaped, who had scaled the building and then fled through the very window it had entered.

In this slim yet packed contribution to the genre founded by Poe, Brazilian author Luis Fernando Verissimo has taken this basic concept--a dead body discovered in a locked room--and added to it some new twists and a vortex of references to Poe's many literary successors.

The murder occurs, appropriately enough, during an international conference on Poe hosted in Buenos Aires. An obnoxious and hypercritical scholar, universally despised and feared, has threatened to demolish the theories of an American scholar. After he is murdered in the dead of night, there are no shortage of suspects: everyone knows how merciless academic rivals can be. The narrator, Vogelstein, also attends the conference and stays down the hall from the hotel room where the murder occurs. It is he who discovers the body against a mirror, apparently in the shape of a letter (Is it meant to be a V? Or does the double image formed by the reflection form an X, O, W, or M?) Before this grisly discovery, Vogelstein's claim to fame is a mangled translation of Jorge Luis Borges's work years earlier. Upon hearing of the murder, Borges steps into the Dupin-Holmes role, apparently forgives Vogelstein's previous crime of literary massacre, and accepts him as his associate.

That's the set-up, and into this concoction Verissimo stirs so many literary allusions that it's a challenge to tease them all out. In addition to Borges and Poe, readers will find references to Lewis Carroll, Conan Doyle, Walter Benjamin, Victor Hugo, Israel Zangwill (who wrote the famous "Big Bow Mystery," another locked-room detective story), and even Sophocles (perhaps the writer of the first murder mystery). The guest star of the book, however, is H. P. Lovecraft (and since I'm not as familiar with his tales as with those of Poe or Borges, I'm sure I missed out on some of the fun.)

Verissimo also throws into the mix the Elizabethan alchemists Edward Kelly and John Dee. It was Dee who Lovecraft clamed wrote his fictional "Necronomicon"; in this novel, Verissimo takes Emile Borel's theory (that a monkey hitting random keys on a typewriter would eventually type every book in Frances's National Library) and claims that Dee suggested first that an orangutan with a pen could do the same. (To my knowledge, he did not ever write such a thing; Verissimo is surely mirroring Lovecraft's invention here.)

You don't have to have read all these authors to enjoy the story, though: it's as transparent and accessible as an Agatha Christie mystery. Still, your satisfaction will be enhanced if you've experienced Borges's stories, which are short enough that one or two samples would require only a few minutes. A good place to start is "There Are More Things," which Borges dedicated to the memory of Lovecraft and which showcases a cursed house in Buenos Aires (and in which the narrator sees a "V of mirrors that faded into shadows above ")

Also important to this novel is "Ibn-Hakam al-Bokhari, Murdered in His Labyrinth," which boasts a pair of sleuths trying to solve a murder and includes the exchange that serves as Verissimo's epigraph: "Mysteries ought to be simple. Remember Poe's purloined letter, remember Zangwill's locked room." "Or complex. Remember the universe."

And, finally, in the one-page sketch "Borges and I," Borges writes about his alter-ego (who makes a cameo in Verissimo's novel as well), whose "tastes run to hourglasses, maps, seventeenth-century typefaces, etymologies, the taste of coffee, and the prose of Robert Louis Stevenson." In fact, he is so like Borges, he's "not sure which of us it is that's writing this page." - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3EU4EISVDAS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081121592X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[D.

"The nameless editor of a tiny book publisher in Porto Alegre receives by post chapters, one by one, of a novel in progress about, or written by 'Ariadne'. She writes about being held hostage by her husband in Frondosa and announces her suicide once she finishes her book. The editor finds her a talent with great potential, despite her never using commas and many spelling errors. He falls in love with her and worries about how to proceed, as an editor and a man. As a fan of John Le Carré and Graham Greene and their works on espionage, he decides `to put a man in place in Frondosa to assess the situation and the enemy's response. He convinces some of his fellow weekend-boozers to move to the small town. And joins his team when they report no longer....

His `Operation Theseus' is based on dreams and conjecture rather than on clearly-defined targets. What follows is a mixture of amusing and dramatic scenes, cleverly linked by the author to a web of references to e.g. the mythical Ariadne of Naxos and other ancient Greeks, German philosophy, the Italian surrealist painter De Chirico and Silvia Plath, a poet famous for foretelling her own exit. And indoor soccer!

Well-plotted and written novella full of obsessions and misunderstandings. Its cast of bizarre characters is reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novels: a man who bet against Brazil in the 1950 World Cup final against Uruguay, whose life was both enriched and blighted ever since. Or the astrologer who never received a cent for his bestseller from the editor's company, and who tags and bombards him with angry letters, then joins `Operation Theseus'. Or the other team members: nihilistic Professor Fortuna and Jewish lecturer Dubin. And the brothers controlling Frondosa, who are the enemy. And Ariadne is married to one of them...

This novel is about obsessions and delusions. It is surely not a love story, nor a philosophical tract or a superbly-plotted spy novel. Readers will surely react is diverse ways to this quirky book and may highlight issues this reader ignored." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWCI2S0LA9HWZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857051121[Alfred J.

*****
A legend throughout Europe - French musician, translator of Raymond Chandler and seminal science fiction writer, poet, songwriter, novelist and screen actor - Boris Vian remains little known in the United States. Los Angeles-based TamTam Book aims to correct this, having published a paperback edition of Vian's landmark thriller "I Spit on Your Graves" in 2001 and now a new translation of his masterful "Foam of the Daze" (L'Ecume des jours"), with the first translation of "L'Automne à Pékin" to follow.

There have been two previous English translations of "Foam": Stanley Chapman's 1967 British edition, "Froth on the Daydream," and Jon Sturrock's U.S. version, "Mood Indigo," which appeared shortly thereafter. Chapman's is by far the superior, admirably transposing Vian's rhythms into English and finding equivalents for his multi-level puns and wordplay. But Brian Harper's hip new translation, edged toward the modern U.S. reader, may well become the standard.

This is a great novel, mind you. Though on its surface, the simplest of stories - Vian summed it up as "a man loves a woman, she falls ill, she dies" - beneath are a host of ambiguities, digressions, levels of meaning. Not quite beneath actually, for subtexts keep erupting to the surface. It is in many ways a novel built of eruptions.

Simply, then, this is a tale of two couples: Colin, a rich and rather superfluous man, and Chloe, a woman dying from a lily growing in her lung; Chick, whose life is ruined by his collecting of Jean-Sol Partre's books and memorabilia, and Alise, who tries to save Chick from himself by murdering Partre. As the lily grows in Chloe's lung, Colin does all he can to keep her alive. But her bed sinks closer to the ground and the room grows ever smaller. Because Colin has no money left to pay for burial, Chloe's coffin is simply thrown out the window.

In Vian's world, nothing is simple, nothing may be taken for granted. Because people they love have died, mice persuade diffident cats to kill them; bells detach themselves from doors to come and announce visitors; neckties rebel against being knotted; some broken windowpanes grow back overnight while others darken from breathing difficulties; a piano mixes cocktails to match the music being played upon it; armchairs and sausages must be calmed before use. When Colin puts Duke Ellington's "The Mood to Be Wooed" on the phonograph, the O's on the record label cause the corners of the room to become round.

In Vian's books, the world becomes ineluctably strange, the world as a child or a madman might see it. And that's the recipe for "Foam of the Daze," a novel with paradox at its heart, as critic David Meakin has observed: one part light-hearted fantasy, one part tragedy. Add wordplay and romance to taste. Your heart will be broken. You will be confused and confounded. You will laugh aloud. And at least for a time, however hard you try, your own world will refuse to be what you think it is.

*****
If you ever wondered what 16th century Italians thought of sex, anal sex, and homosexuality, you can get at least partial satisfaction with the publication of _La Cazzaria: The Book of the Prick_ (Routledge), written in 1525 by Antonio Vignali, edited and translated by Ian Frederick Moulton. It is the first time you will be able to find the book in English. Moulton has heard claims that the book was published under the titles _The Love Academy_ and _Dialogue on Diddling_ (the latter credited to "Sir Hotspur Dunderpate"), but he has found no copies, and says that the mere titles indicate the translations were faulty. Here is his explanation of the title, an interesting view of the translator's problems, and although the book is full of earthy language, this is as raw as it will get in this review: "The dialogue's title is deliberately rude and provocative: it comes from the Italian word _cazzo_, a slang term for 'penis.'" He goes on: "The closest English rendering is probably 'cockery' - but that is too close to 'cookery' to be useful in translation."
Moulton's introduction and notes are an enormous help, as _La Cazzaria_ is a peculiar production. As in the fashion of so many academic writings of the time, from Galileo to Aretino, it is in the form of a dialogue. The elder participant, the instructor, and probably the alter ego of the author, is Arsiccio, who takes the youth Sodo under instruction, as Arsiccio has been embarrassed by a public display of Sodo's lack of sexual knowledge. The problem is that Sodo is not going to gain a great deal of factual knowledge from the words here. Vignali presents a mock-scholarly book, whose humorous lessons will remind many of Erasmus's words in praise of folly. (The other writer who comes to mind is Rabelais, although this flamboyant book has him beat for consistent crudity and fascination for sexual themes.) The dialogue has marginal headings, like any good scholastic work, to introduce major questions, only here they are ribald; among the less profane are, "Why It Is Dishonorable to Attack from Behind," "Why Women Are Disproportioned and Fat Below the Waist," and "Why Women Take Little Steps." Arsiccio is, to put it mildly, a misogynist. He also doesn't think much of the church, or the practice of confession.
Vignali was obviously a highly educated man; his references to classical texts are frequent, even if sometimes they are jovial or deliberately fraudulent. The latter half of the dialogue is devoted to a classical (if facetious) form of argument in which the body is seen as the analogue to a political state. We speak of the "body politic" and the "head of state" because these analogies have been present for a couple of thousand years, but it is significant that in Vignali's parable, there is no head; the body parts involved are, as may be guessed, significantly lower. The meaning of the political allegory in reference to Siena in the 1520's is explained by Moulton in his introduction, but can be enjoyed for its pure silliness and ribald fun. _La Cazzaria_ is a unique text, full of oddities and erudition, and we are lucky to have it available after all these centuries. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NC7Y5MKUPVCY/[Rob Hardy]

[[Bartleby_and_Co]]
*Bartleby & Co.* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Bartleby-Co-Enrique-Vila-Matas/dp/0811216985/[Amazon]

*****
The book is named after the title figure in Herman Melville's short story "Bartleby the Scrivener." Melville's Bartleby is profoundly disengaged from life, and he responds to virtually every request, even those simply asking him to do his job as a scrivener or copy clerk, "I would prefer not to". Vila-Matas uses Bartleby as the prototype for authors who, in one way or another, preferred not to write. Presented as a series of footnotes to a "text that is invisible", BARTLEBY & CO. explores that denial and variants thereof through literature. Among the variants are writers who (somewhat paradoxically) never wrote, writers who vowed not to write again, those with writers' block, those who committed suicide, or those (like Thomas Pynchon) who are especially secretive.

In many respects, the book is an extended essay -- in turn, meditative, irreverent, witty, and (alas) also boring. But it is set in a context that is fictional, almost fantastical: the narrator (named Marcelo) is a reclusive hunchback, unsuccessful with women, who ultimately is fired from his job because he takes off too much time to pursue his obsession with "the literature of the No". The "footnotes" to the invisible text actually take the form of diary entries for the year 1999.

Much of BARTLEBY & CO. clearly is a commentary on contemporary literature or the "impossibility of literature," posing the question, among others, what is the future of literature? At other times, however, the book seems to be a somewhat impressionistic portrayal of existential ennui. (That latter aspect probably is responsible for the former dilemma.)

The novel certainly reflects quite extensive reading on the part of Vila-Matas. Among the writers who are mentioned (in rough order of appearance in the novel): Robert Walser, Robert Moretti, Juan Rulfo, Rimbaud, Socrates, Hofmannsthal and "Letter of Lord Chandos" (the "pinnacle of the literature of the No"), Robert Musil, Franz Kafka, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Valery Larbaud, Pepin Bello, Bobi Bazlen, Danielle Del Grudice, Robert Derain, Arthur Cravan, Hart Crane, Joseph Joubert, Chamfort, Felisberto Hernandez, J.D. Salinger, Fernando Passoa, Elias Canetti, Paul Celan, John Keats, Herman Broch, Mallarme, Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oscar Wilde, Henry Roth, Juan Ramon Jimenez, Marcel Maniere, Derek Walcott, Thomas Pynchon, Guy de Maupassant, B. Traven, and Tolstoy.

If you are not familiar with Melville's story, I strongly recommend taking an hour to read it before starting BARTLEBY & CO. Those who have read the Melville story know that Bartleby is an odd duck. It is doubly fitting that this novel be named after him, because not only does it develop the "Bartleby syndrome" but it too is an odd duck, or an odd book. At first the conceit is interesting, but I found it overdone. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W522J9XG6TLW/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811216985[R. M. Peterson]

*Never Any End to Paris* (2011)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Never-Any-Paris-Enrique-Vila-Matas/dp/0811218139/[Amazon]

*****
Visit one of the three predominant English bookstores in Paris on any given day and you'll see English speaking tourists demanding a copy Hemingway's A Moveable Feast. The myth of the writer lingers in Paris almost more than it does anywhere else. For the main character of Never Any End to Paris not only does he write a book reflecting on his early days as tinged with similarities to those of the young Hemingway, he believes he looks like Hemingway. He enters the Hemingway Look-Alike Context in Key West, Florida only to be disqualified for having an "absolute lack of physical resemblance to Hemingway." This does little, however, to diminish his conviction that every day he looks more and more like Hemingway. A hundred or so pages later the issue becomes more complicated. Our narrator meets a Spanish political exile who is dressed as young Hemingway and who when asked about this replies, "That's because I am Hemingway. I thought you'd realized that."

Enrique Vila-Matas is one of those writers you have to know; to know him start with this novel. Sparkling with odd coincidences, layered remembrances, and referential passages, the book spins a tale with a sort of grounded uncanniness. It is simultaneously an homage to Hemingway and other writers, a remembrance of things passed and past, and a conference speech in progress. The author describes his days living in a Paris garrett and working on a book titled The Lettered Assassin, which must refer to Vila-Matas' book in Spanish titled La asesina ilustrade from 1977, that he hopes will cause the death of each reader as soon as the last page is reached. In fact once the book is written it's sort of the death of Paris because the writer moves back to Barcelona. This is also a book about authors the writer met or did not meet and about what it means to be a young writer possessing questions, energy, and hope in about equal proportion as told by the older writer now filled with irony.

Like A Moveable Feast, worked on by Hemingway late in life and published only after his death, the story is that of a well-read author taking a backward look. Vila-Matas however loves to toss in his own brand of referential game. For example, the young writer is invited to hear the famous author Georges Perec at a secret event. He shows up, gives the password, and watches an imposter (he'd already met Perec and so he knew what he looked like) relate a story about a scrivener who sits behind a folding screen refusing to do anything. The author leaves stating, "I didn't understand a thing." In a novel such a statement is always a sort of Nabokovian tip off. The scrivener story is the Herman Melville short story Bartleby the Scrivener who when asked to do his job always replies, "I would prefer not to." But it spins deeper. Vila-Matas' first book to be published in English was Bartleby & Co., a novel about writers who stop writing, often for years, which poses the question: can not-writing be as artistic and as productive as writing? What if a writer simple prefers not to write? Vila-Matas style is similar to that of Javier Marias or Roberto Bolano meaning expect less plot and more literary fun.

Vila-Matas is a significant and exceptional writer who thankfully, for those of use who do not speak Spanish, is now being published in English.

*Dublinesque* (2012)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Dublinesque-Directions-Paperbook-Enrique-Vila-Matas/dp/0811219615/[Amazon]

*****
Dublinesque should have a big banner on its cover stating, "Serious readers only." Because this is, at its core, a book about literature and readers. Take this comment by Mr. Vila-Matas' key character (and perhaps in some sense, alter ego): "The same skills needed for writing are needed or reading. Writers fail readers, but it also happens the other way around and readers fail writers when all they ask of them is confirmation that the world is how they see it..."

Well, Mr. Vila-Matas does not fail his reader. This is an ambitious book, on its surface about a retired and ailing Barcelona publisher named Samuel Riba, who decides to journey with three friends to Dublin during Bloomsday on June sixteenth, where he can retrace the path of James Joyce's Bloom (from Ulysses). While there, he wishes to say a requiem for the culture of the Gutenberg age (that has now morphed into the Google age) and at the same time, say a requiem for himself, a literary publisher very much in decline.

It helps to have at least a familiarity with Ulysses; Riba (and by extension, his creator) provide fascinating interpretative snippets as the book propels forward. It also helps to know Philip Larkin, who wrote the poem Dublinesque, about an old Dublin prostitute who, in her last hour, is accompanied by a few co-workers along city streets. And if the reader happens to know Samuel Beckett, Paul Auster, John Banville, David Cronenberg (cinema's last real director, according to Riba), William Yeats, and other artistic luminaries, so much the better.

There are many golden nuggets about the craft and purpose of writing (Riba kept striving to find a writer "truly able to dream in spite of the world: to structure the world in a different way. A great writer: at once anarchist and architect.") There are also great insights into our collective journey through mortality: going "from the existence of the sacred (Joyce) to the somber era of the disappearance of God (Beckett)." It's about holding on to enthusiasm and doing what we need to do. ("You haven't made us come to Dublin so you can turn yourself into a metaphor, have you?" queries one of Riba's friends.) It's about the unlived past and our continued existence.

Mostly, though, it is a book of ideas, beautifully translated from the Spanish by Anne McLean and Rosalind Harvey. It's not a book to love - Riba keeps us at arm's distance and we get to know his musings and philosophies, not his heart - but it is a book that makes us think and stand up and take notice. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUQK58HP3PVY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811219615&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Jill I.

An author (a version of Vila-Matas himself) presents a short “history” of a secret society, the Shandies, who are obsessed with the concept of “portable literature.” The society is entirely imagined, but in this rollicking, intellectually playful book, its members include writers and artists like Marcel Duchamp, Aleister Crowley, Witold Gombrowicz, Federico García Lorca, Man Ray, and Georgia O’Keefe. The Shandies meet secretly in apartments, hotels, and cafes all over Europe to discuss what great literature really is: brief, not too serious, penetrating the depths of the mysterious. We witness the Shandies having adventures in stationary submarines, underground caverns, African backwaters, and the cultural capitals of Europe. - http://www.amazon.com/History-Portable-Literature-Directions-Paperbook/dp/081122337X/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
Welcome to "Animal Farm" as performed within the setting of the Soviet National Writers Union during the communist era. We all know the AF credo: "All men are born equal--some more so than others" could have been made to order for the bloated pompous Soviet bureaucracy of yore. Fur Hat was my first introduction to Vladimir Voinovich: after reading this delightful satire on corruption/cronyism/toadyism within Party machinations, I nominate Voinovich on a par with Vonnegut. Readers will meet lots of Party types in this story: typical system hacks (Pyotr Lukin), over-decorated pompous military types (Karetnikov) and blatant anti-Semites (nearly every character in the book). Even our hapless protagonist, Yefim R, is married to a devoted Party member, "...but underneath her bra she wore a cross..." All kinds of deceit and posturing go on on a daily basis..the politics and pecking order of the national Writers Union come front & center as smug leaders pass out fur hats to its members, according to their rank and file within the group. Of course, celebrated writers who've won (dubiously so, albeit) titles and accolades get the top fur hats like reindeer and rabbit. Our hero, Yefim, receives the lowest ranking hat: fluffy tomcat. Poor Yefim. He is not disrespected by the powers-that-be because of his mediocre talent, but because he "writes only of good men challenging earthly elements." Union officials don't approve of Yefim's "writing about decent people & pretending there's no such thing as the Soviet state, or district and regional committees." Yefim's determined efforts to get a higher-ranking hat for himself ("even rabbit would be better!!") unfold into sublime absurdity as he goes from one Party official to another, encountering toadyism/nepotism/bribery/euphemisms and underhanded tactics. "Even on an iceberg, a Soviet collective will have its careerists, stool pigeons and at least one KGB agent." An exiled scribbler from the Soviet Union himself (1980), Voinovich rips on the Russian mentality that delight in military over-decoration and its writers that write just to receive titles and headlines. And international headlines themselves does our Yefim make as he finally loses his temper with one especially dull Party hack. When the western media ggets hold of this incident, they blow it all out of proportion (as western media is wont to do). Then our hero gets blacklisted as rumors of his "treason" spread like wildfire (the perfect example how rampant paranoid delusions become in police states). The western media dubs Yefim a dissident and builds his literary reputation up far beyond even his own imaginings! You'll have to read the book to see how the 'fur hat debacle' turns out. DANGER: THIS BOOK IS AN EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY BASHER!

[[Private_Ivan_Chonkin]]
*The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin* (1995)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Extraordinary-Adventures-Private-European-Classics/dp/0810112434/[Amazon]

*****
Ivan Chonkin is an inept private in the Soviet army on the cusp of World War Two who first finds himself ordered to guard an airplane in a distant village, then finds himself forgotten by the authorities, and finally remembered and with a vengeance.

`The Life and Extraordinary Times of Private Ivan Chonkin' might be called a Soviet Catch-22 [Catch-22: A Novel (Simon & Schuster Classics)] for its seemingly absurdist send up of life in the Red Army. I say 'seemingly absurdist' because, like Catch-22, one suspects there is more than a little truth in Voinovich's portrayal of bureaucratic tomfoolery. Chonkin himself calls to mind George Macdonald Fraser's McAuslan (McAuslan in the Rough), the bumbling private in a Scottish Highland regiment. Others have likened it the The Good Soldier Svejk: and His Fortunes in the World War (Penguin Classics), which I have not yet read.

The background of Stalinist terror gives Voinovich's work a darker cast. Army bureaucrats endeavor at all costs to keep a low profile to avoid attracting the attention of the higher ups. Such attention is too often accompanied in their minds with imprisonment, exile, or death.

A favorite bit occurs late in the book when a regiment has surrounded the village in order to take Chonkin into custody. Chonkin has taken seven members of the secret police captive and the regiment has come to the rescue. (In the meantime, Chonkin has turned this group of seven into such efficient farm workers that word soon reaches the newspapers and even Comrade Stalin. The local chairman feels certain doom is sure to follow such success.) The captain of the secret police escapes, but falls into the hands of army, which he mistakenly thinks is the German army. Much hilarity ensues.

Although the book is somewhat an artifact of the Stalinist era and is almost certainly even better if one can read it in the original Russian (alas, I cannot), the book still rates five stars and my highest recommendation in part for the rare look it provides into life in the wartime Soviet Union and in part for its timeless portrayal of army bureaucracy, and the universal slacker, Ivan Chonkin. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BXG7ZE2HZCF/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810112434&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Douglas S.

*****
World War II is on and Chonkin is imprisoned in this sequal to his extraordinary adventures. Chonkin figures less prominently in this sequal. I think, the major character here is the social system itself. Voinovich does not spare anyone or anything: Joseph Stalin, the Soviet military planning, and the prison system--all are criticized. Bumbling bureaucrats continue to bludner like there was no tomorrow. For example, they capture and execute an honest junior officer as a spy, while the real spy continues to work undisturbed. And the bumbling of this sort is pittance in comparison to what has just gone on--the 1937/38 terror. Most outstanding people have been destroyed on no greater basis than wild accusations and Stalin's paranoia. It turns out that the most potent weapon in the war on the cream of society's crop is a simple pencil! Write an accusation on someone who works hard in his field and has his head in the clouds, not paying attention to politics, and that person is soon arrested and executed. Given this absurd atmosphere of repression and the pressure and fear put on the government by war, Chonkin must languish in prison on suspicion of being a descendant of a noble Russian family which is trying to overthrow the government and open the gates to the Germans!

Voinovich's satire is right on target. This book is funny and educational. If you live in a Western democracy you will, at a minimum, reap one important benefit from reading this--you will appreciate even more what you have in your country today. I assigned a number of Russian writers in my Modern Russian Politics class last year, and this is exactly what the impact was. Read Voinovich--his books are humorous and different. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R12DK19EWK5F1M/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810112442&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[unraveler]

*****
It is wonderful to finally to finally hold in my hands a book that I thought I would never see - the final volume of the epic trilogy on the incredible adventures of the simple Russian arm private with the constantly unraveling leggings, Ivan Chonkin. The author Vladimir Voinovich talks a little about the reasons for the delay in his preface, but the main thing is now we have the conclusion of the story. Ivan and Nyrua continue to face the incredible twists and turns of their life with simplicity, goodness and a large degree of acceptance and incomprehension. Their fate seperates them for many years, sending one to the remote mysterious land of Ohio, before finally bringing them togehter in the place where it all started. Chonkin, by his innate goodness, serves as a rebuke to the evil around him in the Soviet regime and seems to drive his masters a little mad. Stalin and Beria, who were rather bit players in the previous volumes, play a much larger part here and the rather sordid nature of their deaths (which both does and does not correspond to the historical record) serves as a judgement on them, as does the survival and happiness of Ivan and Nyrua at the end of the book. True, it is a happiness that is a little sad, but it is a consistent ending to their stories, in which Voinovich seamlessly weaves together the completely fantastic with the couldn't-happen-any-other-way. There is one heartbreaking moment when it seems that Ivan and Nyrua - like Evangeline and Gabriel - will never meet again, but the narrator is kind to his readers brings them together for a last embrace and quite a bit more. The telling is as scattershot as ever, which for me was always a large part of its charm, with many digressions, including a few into some of Voinovich's novels, and a major Man in the Iron Mask subplot. We learn the fates of most of the other character from previous books And like any good fantasy, there is a strong element of mystery. No one in the novel seems to be able to remember the insignificant Chonkin's name, but Stalin, the polar opposite of Chonkin, knows it and wants above all things for Chonkin to be brought to his presence. Why? Because of his dream in the first volume? Because of the fascination that a totally guileless man has for a plotter like Stalin? Because Chonkin knows about horses? For some other reason, for some unknown connection between them? The entire American intelligence apparatus, as well as the reader, wants to know. But here at least the author never indulges us. Stalin/Beria's plots are destroyed as easily as a man wiping away a spider's web. And the mystery of the connection between evil and good is left unresolved, as it should be. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JIFP442Y4VH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810126621&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Bob S.]

From Antoine Volodine comes a deeply disturbing and darkly hilarious novel whose full meaning, its author asserts, will be found not in the book’s pages but in the dreams people will have after reading it. In Minor Angels Volodine depicts a postcataclysmic world in which the forces of capitalism have begun to reestablish themselves. Sharply opposed to such a trend, a group of crones confined to a nursing home—all of them apparently immortal—resolves to create an avenging grandson fashioned of lint and rags. Though conjured to crush the rebirth of capitalism, the grandson is instead seduced by its charms—only to fall back into the hands of his creators, where he manages to forestall his punishment by reciting one “narract” a day. It is these narracts, or prose poems, that compose the text of Minor Angels. - http://www.amazon.com/Minor-Angels-Antoine-Volodine/dp/0803220898/[Amazon boilerplate]

*****
In a single evening late in World War II a party gathers at an Austrian chateau to be entertained by, and pay homage to, a Nazi host. The completely amoral Marshall is as clever as he is brutal and the counterpoint to his dominant will is his ability to charm even his worst enemy. He is pitted against his guests, particularly the benign Steinbaum who proves unable to withstand the alternate cruelty and wit of the Marshal. The careful style and the frank description of a world of uncertain reality work to advance a brilliant analysis of the people who serve and were served by the Nazis.

Roger Sale says that this novel "can quickly be described as being about Herman Goring and by Henry James. It is a wonderful tour de force, and if it doesn't reread so well as it reads, that is in part due simply to one's amazement the first time that such a book could exist. It takes 400 pages to describe the events of one evening, with, obviously, great slowness and concentration. - http://www.amazon.com/Writers-Choice-Linda-Sternberg-Katz/dp/083598799X/[Writer's Choice (1983)]

Simplicius Simplicissimus is an artful and stunningly humorous account of the adventures of naive and utterly simple idiot boy who acquires a rich knowledge of life through a series of amazing adventures. This book was written in 1669 - nearly 100 years prior to Voltaire's Candide. Unfortunately, Amazon.com does not list the name of the translator of the offered edition. There are several English language translations available. The British translation by Walter Wallich is excellent and true to the original, preserving both the author's wit and creative prose. An American translation by George Schulz-Behrend is utterly lamentable and should be avoided at all costs - it completely sterilizes the author's humor and has the appearance of having been translated under the close and fastidious censorship of a puritan sect. It is not advisable to purchase the version offered by amazon.com, unless and until they can clearly specify the name of the translator. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLOASO38RGLH/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1879751380&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140005102/[Amazon]

*****
This book must be the most nearly perfect piece of comic writing in English, its humour gentle and subtle, its depiction of character, class, time and location flawless. It fixes forever the late-Victorian world of the respectable Lower Middle Class, populated by clerks, petty merchants and tradesmen, observing it with both objectivity and affection. It is splendidly read on tape by Frederick Davidson, whose assumed accent is perfectly gauged to reflect the upwardly-mobile aspirations of the Mr.Charles Pooter, the self-confessed nobody of the title, and which slips down the social scale by several notches in moments of stress and frustration. Though superficially simple, the construction of the narrative is complex in the extreme, with comic situations often being built up over a long period, and with clues carefully planted in earlier sections, only to come to fruition later. It is particularly impressive how the main characters - Pooter himself, his long-suffering and often silly but supportive wife Carrie and his exasperating son Lupin - emerge as rounded characters from apparently simple diary entries and achieve a realism and familiarity as great as any in more serious literature. The situations in which they find themselves - or rather get themselves - are not only ludicrously amusing, but also close to the normality of life as many live it, and one can often, uncomfortably, recognise one's self or one's friends in their reactions to them. What makes the Diary an enduring masterpiece is however the gentle and affectionate treatment of human weakness - and greatness. Pooter may be pompous, foolish and sometimes sycophantic, but he is also loyal, decent and honourable and his life, and his family's, for all its pettiness, also has its dignity. I first read the Diary over forty years ago and it has never ceased to delight me since - it remains a treasured bedside book to be opened at random - and this splendid tape of it is an ideal companion for long or short automobile journeys. (An interesting footnote is that George Grossmith, as a singer and actor, created many of the best known Gilbert and Sullivan roles on stage). - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NS0F9JUFSE7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140005102&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Donal A.

*****
THE IRISH monastery of Clonmacnoise has long been free from demonic attack, but when its defenses are finally breached, it is discovered that the Forces of Darkness are taking refuge in the cell of Brother Fursey, whose stammer prevents him from reciting the necessary exorcisms. So Fursey is cast out, a supernatural horde trailing behind him. When he takes shelter with a widow, propriety demands that he marry her. But she is a witch and Fursey accidentally acquires her powers. Now a sorcerer, albeit an incompetent one, whose sole trick is tossing a rope over a beam to produce a mug of beer, he is feared throughout Ireland, pursued by the Church, and defended in court by the Devil himself.

In the second volume, Fursey despairs of being reconciled with the Church and embraces wickedness. Alas, he is unequal to the task, too squeamish to allow Albert, his long-suffering familiar, even a drop of his blood, not quite up to murder, and an embarrassment at the Sabbat.

Synopsis cannot do these books justice. They are masterpieces of comic fantasy, full of barbed satire and, ultimately, heart-rending tragedy, as lovable, sad Fursey simply cannot find a place for himself, either among the forces of Light or those of Darkness. They are as good as T. H. White, better than Cabell, utterly unique. Wall (1908-1995) was an Irish playwright, novelist, and civil servant, well-known in Irish literary circles, but, alas, yet undiscovered by fantasy readers in general.

*****
Jakov von Gunten is not like any novel I have read before and not, despite all the comparisons, like any novel of Kafka's. It is more like a series of first person reflections, with only the repeating cast of characters and the narrator to hold the novel together. Kafka's novels all have a certain narrative drive, and here there is very little, although the story of the slow dissolution of the school is strangely moving.

Bernard van Dieren once wrote that every original mind is a cosmos in itself: Walser gains nothing from being continually advertised as Kafka-lite. He is his own writer. By any standard, he is not as great a writer as Kafka, but his outlook is much more genial - less insular and more human - despite the fact that Walser and not Kafka was the one who ended up in the insane asylum. This book is his long masterpiece. The episodic rambling quality of the novel betrays Walser's roots in the short story, but the material never feels scattershot or forced together.

Something Jakob says gets at what Walser might be trying to do - he's writing about the hair of the students in the school: "And because we all look so charmingly barbered and parted, we all look alike, which would be a huge joke for any writer, for example, if he came on a visit to study us in our glory and littleness. This writer had better stay at home. Writers are just windbags who only want to study, make pictures and observations. To live is what matters, then the observation happens of its own accord."

A strange thought for someone writing in a diary! But maybe the diary form is the closest that any writer can come to approximating the feeling of life, and letting the reader make his or her own observations. Walser does seem to have a certain distrust of the intellect, but he is not a naive, untutored talent; what he sees, though, is the limitations of intellect, which is perhaps his closest relationship with Kafka - "One is always wrong when one takes up with big words," he writes, and produces a masterpiece using all small ones. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I71KPDY26WAD/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322218&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Gulley Jimson]

*****
 Remembered today primarily for her wonderful The Kingdoms of Elfin (1977)--whose component tales, thanks to the defensive patronage of editor William Maxwell, hold the distinction of being some of the only archetypical fantasy stories ever published by The New Yorker--Sylvia Townsend Warner (1893-1978) exhibited an abiding interest in the fantastic from the publication of her very first novel, Lolly Willowes (1926). The Cat's Cradle- Book finds her at the height of her powers.

In the framing introduction, a nameless woman arrives at a simple country cottage, meets a handsome young man with many cats, converses enjoyably with both cats and man, has impromptu sex with the cottager, and thus becomes inextricably and tragically linked to his plan to disseminate the global folklore of felines he's painstakingly collected. The sixteen stories that follow are ostensibly these ailurine myths.

Few of the tales actually feature cats, since "the proper study of catkind is man," their capricious patrons. Instead, Warner offers a range of hilarious, grim, stunning, frequently Kafkaesque narratives that defiantly refuse to resolve into simple morals. Eminently quotable ("Stupid prayers are often the soonest answered, for no deity can stand them."), Warner carries Dorothy Parker's kind of brittle, elegant wit to its apotheosis. And her quiet feminism, in such tales as "The Trumpeter's Daughter" and "Bread for the Castle" still strikes home.

In "Virtue and the Tiger," a holy man wreaks havoc on an innocent predator with his accumulated saintliness. Warner's art favors cats, but focuses on humans as the real beasts. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2001/cur0112.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

All of Hamilkar's tales were similar to these, odd and unnatural

[I]t is not the miracle which spawns faith but the reverse

We see [history's] face only when she is behind us

This is 1927! Make time to read this brief, compelling book - skip the unhelpful foreword would be my advice and plunge straight into these fantastic tall tales. (Reality, though, was even less imaginable.) Wat talks of 'chaplains who did not know that the soul of religion is not a mystified revelation but a revealed mystification' and 'philosophers who, in unmasking revelation as a mystification, did not notice that mystification *is* revelation' (though this story, being on humour, is the least funny). These were dark times (many could see in 1918 that Europe was doomed, though many chose to deny it - after all, what to do?) and just as Kafka makes perfect, chilling sense in German, this makes one want to learn Polish. Besides being Polish Wat like Kafka was a Jew, and this is a secret Jewish classic, though the conclusion of the title story, and the book, is frankly a cop-out, and what on earth is the top of page 121 supposed to mean (not two pairs but bunches)?

If I may nitpick, the translator glosses Ramsay MacDonald (1st Labour PM) but not Monsalvat, which with some difficulty I gather is the location of the Grail in Parsifal. Gee thanks, Lillian Vallee - was I supposed to know that? I'm tone deaf. And then - all on one page - Tanagra, Little Entente, Chicherin.. Denke? (Serial killer, 1870-1924.) Stinnes? (German industrialist, same dates.) Carpentier? (French boxer, crops up twice.) Better scrap that first note altogether, though two notes for the title story were useful. Jan of Leiden is John of Leiden (I thought the Czech Jan Hus was intended - the Jan we 'all' know as it were - but Leiden was a puzzle) and there's a terrible typo(?) on page 62, Vernard de Clairvaux for Bernard. By the way (p20) a pimp's a pander, not a panderer (the verb to pander derives from the noun). I feel bad now; the stalwart Ms Vallee - she who brought us Gombrowicz and Zagajewski - truly deserves every encouragement - http://www.amazon.com/review/RDT0JLR1GDHH6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810108402&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Simon Barrett 'Il Penseroso']

Set at the tail end of 1950s, the story is told by Billy Fisher, who lives with his parents in the fictional Yorkshire town of Stradhoughton. Billy can't cope with his tedious clerking job at a local funeral parlor, living at home, or really anything about his life, and so, spends a great deal of time escaping into fantasy world in his head called Ambrosia. When he's not imagining life as prime minister of his make-believe country, he's spinning mostly purposeless lies to almost everyone he meets. Sometimes he's lying to cover up real misdeeds, such as his smalltime embezzling, other times, his lies are completely pointless, such as telling a friend's mother about his fictional sister.

At first, his carefree, devil-may-care insouciance is amusing and the reader is drawn into Billy's bizarre self-vision as lively raconteur and comic wit. However, as the story progresses, he becomes a more troublesome figure. He's engaged to two different girls, and apparently in love with a third. More problematically, he has no emotional connection to realityóevery episode in his life takes on the aspect of a sketch or scene in which he struggles to determine what role to play, what accent to adopt, or what pose to strike. It becomes heartbreaking to witness Billy's belief that he's smarter than everyone around him and destined for great things, when everyone else can see right through his poses and tired routines. (It'd be interesting to know what a psychiatrist's diagnosis of Billy would be.) As the lies pile up, Billy finds himself painted into a corner from which only drastic action will free him. His only avenue of escape is to actually pursue his longstanding claim of a job offer in London writing scripts for a standup comic. The reader is torn between wanting Billy to stay and face up to his misdeeds, and wanting him to get on that train to the Big Smoke and realize his dreams. Of course, the outcome is inevitable.

Waterhouse grew up in Leeds, and like Billy, worked as a clerk in an undertakers. The prose is liberally sprinkled with Yorkshire dialect, and does a brilliant job of capturing the small town atmosphere, from the grubby disco, to the local cafe, and claustrophobic house. The book was turned into a play the year after publication and into an excellent film several years later, a TV miniseries in the early 1970s, and an insipid American TV series called Billy. A sequel called Billy Liar on The Moon appeared in 1977, and more recently there are allegedly plans for an American feature film remake, although I'm not sure who thought that would be a good idea.. - http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R314LPQPIS9FTY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141041730&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=266239&store=books[A.

*****
Don Webb's first novel The Double will come as no surprise to readers familiar with his huge output of short stories and essays, particularly for the highly regarded Fringeware Review magazine. There must be something in the water of Austin, Texas, because Webb's Vision is an unusual but strangely compelling one.

Webb's dialogue and plot structure is like something out of a David Lynch movie co-written by Robert Anton Wilson and Jack Sarfatti. There are some unusual twists on familiar themes from crime and occult mystery literature, and on what it is like to survive fin-de-siecle nervous breakdowns, dissociations, and fugue states.

Webb has obviously done both research and praxis of S&M, Memetics, and Optimal Psychology; methods for the alchemical processing of Humanity via Ordeals-of-Change; and creative excuses for handling editors via psychological warfare ("I woke up this morning, and there was a dead body in my room that looked exactly like me!").

A wyrd trip, but one definately worth taking. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCHWIXBD5YGKD/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312191448[Alex Burns]

http://www.amazon.com/Endless-Honeymoon-Don-Webb-ebook/dp/B00FO7F6AI/[Amazon]

*****
In Endless Honeymoon, Webb chronicles the exploits of a serial killer with a unique obsession: the aptly named "Sh*tkiller," on a personal mission to rid the world of those who delight in the misery of others, targets only the mean and cruel spirited. Although he's made dozens of kills across America over the course of several decades, the FBI has few clues as to his identity or motive.

The job of tracking down this legendary killer has ended several careers, most recently that of Abel Salazar. Although severed from the Bureau, Salazar, funded by a mysterious benefactor, continues the pursuit, obsessively following up every lead regarding his nemesis, including several uncovered by his successor in the investigation, the hapless Special Agent William Mondragon.

Recent events have led Mondragon to focus on Willis and Virginia Spencer, a couple who, stumbling upon an early version of the killer's victim selection software, have put it to an entirely different use--instead of killing the targets, they play elaborate pranks on them, hoping to scare them into changing their ways. Unfortunately for the well meaning couple, their activities bring them into direct contact with their spiritual "mentor" when they one night find they have selected the same target. That fateful encounter is a catalyst for the rest of the novel, setting in motion a bizarre scenario where all parties are eventually thrown together. The results are by turns outrageous, tragic, and comic.

Essentially a "road" novel, the book hangs together nicely. Webb always keeps things hopping, even while exploring relatively familiar terrain. The narrative draws most of its strength from the revealing interactions of a strong ensemble cast--Webb explores the duality of love and hate, fate and chance, loyalty and betrayal, crime and justice, retribution and forgiveness, all the while making his audience laugh its collective head off. His skewed perspective, one he shares with fellow Texans Joe R. Lansdale, Howard Waldrop, Neil Barrett, Bruce Sterling, William Browning Spencer and Lewis Shiner, and with spiritual brother David Prill (a Minnesotan!), is a breath of fresh air, raising Endless Honeymoon high above the usual fare. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QN6NE1OG3NUD/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO7F6AI&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Amazon Customer]

*The Game for Real* (2015)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
A sad side effect of my whole-hearted admiration for and fascination with this book by Richard Weiner – who, apparently a hidden genius (amalgam of «la littérature minéure», to paraphrase Deleuze), was unknown to me before I stumbled upon this – is that I find it very hard to talk about it, neither have I read it well enough yet to get to any considerable depth, it just seems to me that others are slow in discovering it so I figured maybe help them a bit, which would also result in better reviews by better readers.

This is an incredible book comprising of two seemingly disjointed parts, which makes it hard to call it a novel, still its uniqueness makes it even harder to label it a collection; whatever one calls it, it is a miracle of prose...; lacking in words either for praise or proper description, I will try to communicate my feeling about the specificity of this writing: abstraction that this prose attains is closer to visual than verbal, or at least to both, by which I mean that it will often fall into the kinds of geometrical forms, curves and circles, that brings Kandinsky to mind, by such techniques Weiner masterly dissolves the matter and seems to go deep further into the heart of the matter. The matter, if such, here is simple, except that it is not, for the way it is treated soon proves to be so disturbing and frightening that one might find oneself wishing it was all dream, which is reasonable too, for there is much dreamlike in it, except that once you're sure that's what you're in for, the situation will be atomized in such lucid, hyperrealist fashion shattering all your dreams for a dream. Another interesting and amazing, to say the least, technique that is achieved here is how something will be hinted at, then, after couple of paragraphs, if not pages, re-hinted at, then hushed, then announced or re-announced, from this and that point of view almost like cinematically, and once, at last, it appears that the thing had emerged in its entirety, you will only be let sip a bit and it will shape shift in something different altogether, leaving you bewildered.

All this makes for somewhat tough read, but the book is never less than fascinating, and ultimately mind-blowing. Weiner is original not only because he resembles no one else (he might, I don't know), but because the reading experience he offers is really unlike any other I have had and if we are not granted translations of his other work (this translation being supreme) I will be left with the possibility only of re-reading this again and again, which, in fact, does not sadden me in the least, for this is not only the kind of book that should be extensively re-read (as all the good books should be), more than that, reading this once (or twice) is not really reading it. So get the copy. - https://www.amazon.com/review/R2CH225Q9YHIYO/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931883440&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Irakli Qolbaia]

*****
For those who like their satire black, this compulsively readable comic novel is a deliciously dark dose. Weiss takes the awkward and contemporary dance of intermarriage and gleefully ups the stakes until it's transformed into a fiery, high-stakes tango set to the tune of theSpanish Inquisition.

The trouble all begins when white-bread WASP Allison Pennybaker and Sephardic Jew Solomon Beneviste announce their engagement. Allison's family gets busy planning an overpriced church wedding that appalls Solomon's intense mother, Miriam. She meanwhile, is occupied creating her own gift for the ill-fated couple -- a family tree that traces the bizarre Beneviste genealogy all the way back to the era of the autos-da-fe.

Using squeaky, callow Allision and coolly singleminded Miriam as his narrators, Weiss spins a horrifyingly funny, take-no-prisoners tale in which the past rumbles to life, rearing its head up through the green lawns of American suburbia to curse this interfaith engagement of two innocents. He playfully uses biblical references and other allusions to artfully braiding a black chapter in Jewish history into the present action, and the results are tragicomic. Allison's plump and pompous mother, Louise, is a modern-day reincarnation of Torquemada. A scene where Miriam swoons during a beer-soaked all-American baseball game played by athletes with Spanish surnames is a particularly pleasurable set piece.

While keeping all his satirical balls in the air, Weiss displays some remarkable gifts. He plays nimbly with societal stereotypes of WASPs and Jews. The Pennybakers and Benevistes are complex, delightfully unselfconscious and eminently credible. They're immeasurably enriched by Weiss's uncanny and chameleonic talent for writing in a wide range of voices. "The Swine's Wedding" is one of the most original books to come around in a long time: richly symbolic, brilliantly built, witty and disturbing. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ESRTYV9K7OLF/[Bookworm]

Voici un livre aussi marquant et révolutionnaire que le fut en son temps le Ulysse de James Joyce, je crois. Là aussi un trajet initiatique, écrit dans une langue parfois très complexe. Dès les premières pages vous comprenez que vous avez en mains un livre extraordinaire, rien à voir avec un "blockbuster" quelconque. L'histoire est celle d'un dieu mythologique, fils d'Aphrodite,qu'elle envoie à New-York : là il se retrouve confronté au monde moderne comme dans un "road movie", et plus particulièrement celui de toutes les facettes sexuelles, y compris celles des pires bas-fonds, d'une grande ville moderne. Donc tantôt une expression poétiquement antique(démontrant l'immense culture de l'auteur) , tantôt le "'slang" le plus vulgaire. Ce qui donne lieu bien entendu à bien des malentendus amusants . Une des pages les plus savoureuses est celle où , alors que l'interlocuteur parle de préservatifs (Aphrodite, Trojans), le Dieu pense lui à ses Dieux de l'Olympe et n'y comprend plus rien "I swear by Aphrodite" je ne jure que par Aphrodite "dit le terrien, ce qui réjouit le dieu mais non : il s'agissait de condoms ! : "So you're a Trojan man ?" Moi ! Un Troyen ! Mais jamais de la vie ! Attention : très politiquement incorrect et avec des scènes "explicites" comme dirait la censure. Mais ce n'est pas cela l'important, l'important c'est qu'au fur et à mesure de la lecture l'enrichissement intellectuel devient manifeste. Mémorable !On n'en ressort pas indemne.

*****
"THE WAR of the Worlds (1898) is a landmark of science fiction. Yet, in all the history of literature, no other novel of such magnitude has spawned so obscure a sequel by the same author. Star Begotten, written four decades later (and published in America with a hyphenated title: Star-Begotten) must be reckoned as Wells's official sequel to his War of the Worlds. Very briefly in this novel, the characters reminisce about those pesky Martians who invaded London two generations earlier. Star Begotten is a subdued and moody sequel, with much angst and very little action.

Joseph Davis is a respectable Londoner: married, with a young son and a career as an author of popular histories. (He thoroughly resembles an idealized younger version of Wells himself.) Gradually, Davis becomes convinced that the Martians have begun a second, subtler campaign to conquer Earth: this time the Martians are modulating the cosmic rays that bombard Earth, in a manner calculated to cause gradual mutations in humanity's genome, so that humans will eventually evolve into Martians. In his growing certainty—or perhaps it's paranoia—Davis believes he has discovered evidence that his own son is a Martian…and maybe also his wife…and perhaps even Davis himself.

In Star Begotten, the aged and embittered H. G. Wells approached the threshold of Philip K. Dick's universe, depicting a protagonist who can no longer decide what is real, or whether or not "the world isn't some queer sort of put-up job." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2007/cur0708.htm[F.

*****
Orphaned Maria lives alone in Malplaquet, the vast and ruined eighteenth-century country house which is her sole inheritance from her parents. Her guardians, the odious vicar Mr. Hater and the oppressive governess Miss Brown, strive unceasingly to keep Maria firmly in her place and under control. But Maria has too much spirit and wit to be kept down, and though she has no friends her own age, she does have allies of a sort: Cook, who keeps a bicycle handy for getting around the vast corridors of Malplaquet, and the eccentric and distracted Professor, who lives nearby in a cottage crammed with books. Though they're adults, Cook and the Professor are powerless too against the organized, bland-faced evil of Mr. Hater and Miss Brown, and Maria is on her own when she battles them. And she does battle: at first guerrilla warfare, and later out-and-out pitched engagements, in some of the funniest scenes ever committed to paper.

Initially Maria's revolts are small. She sneaks out while Miss Brown suffers from headache and visits one of her hideaways: a pond, which has an island holding an abandoned summer-house in the center, once a focal point of the glorious gardens but now like the rest overgrown and wild. Maria lands on her island and finds that it's not, however, unoccupied: tiny people live there as well. The island is hers; the summerhouse is hers; and Maria considers that the people are hers as well.

The practical and impractical things Maria does with, and for, her little people and what they do with, and for, Maria is the heart of the book. Subtly, this is a story about power---the vicar's and governess's over Maria, Maria's over the little people---and revolt. Maria, a tough soul who nonetheless suffers under domination, faces a choice when she finds her Lilliputians, and it's not an easy one. White is too honest to give us a snap cheap solution: Maria isn't perfect, but her heart is true, and in the end she deserves the heroic efforts of her seemingly-powerless friends on her behalf and earns all the happiness we want her to have.

White was a pathologically peculiar character, yet his formula for a good children's book is still completely winning. He knew precisely which elements belong in a story about an orphaned child (Wart or Maria), a mysterious wizardly advisor (Merlin or the Professor), and a great destiny to be achieved (kingship or Malplaquet) with magical or otherworldly assistance (Merlin's enchantments or the indomitable Lilliputians). It is a shame he didn't leave us more YA writing than Mistress Masham and The Sword in the Stone, but we shouldn't be greedy: in Mistress Masham's Repose alone is a story worth any hundred others.

White never speaks down to his young reader, never misses a chance to make a reference or an intelligent observation. It's this assumption that everything that interests him will interest you, even if you're 10, that makes him so endearing and makes the writing in these stories so wonderful. The layers on layers of truths and facts and skewed references ("Like all Admirals, he sat his rat badly") make Maria's story utterly convincing, and the Lilliputians become just one more part of the eighteenth century to survive, to our eyes odd but as plausible in context as, say, Horace Walpole.

Readers who like Mistress Masham will also love Mary Norton's Borrowers series, written starting in 1953, well after Mistress Masham appeared in 1946. (The books are far better than the truly awful recent movie would imply.) They can safely skip John Peterson's Littles; Norton's Borrowers are more original and far better. E. B. White's Stuart Little, also about a small person in a big world, is a different kind of story altogether and not derivative of either.

Looking for a copy of this book for a friend, I was surprised to find only a fancy reproduction edition listed as being in print. And an edition without the essential original Fritz Eichenberg illustrations, at that. Putnam, the original publisher, had Mistress Masham in print recently, and it *must* still be available; it probably turns up on school book-club lists too. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R37N0NEEZ50LJ6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171039&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A Customer]

*****
ELEVEN-year-old twins and their dog marooned on an island ruled by a mind-controlling genius bent on world domination? If that sounds unpromising, please note that The Master is one of the last works by the author of The Once and Future King, and a rare venture into sf.

The Master, one hundred and fifty-seven years old, frail but adept at telepathy and mesmerism, is pitiful and frightening. White wisely avoids showing too much of him. And though the Master's henchmen look like the supporting cast of a Sax Rohmer melodrama, White gives them sufficient dimension to work against stereotype.

In fact, the tongueless Pinky, the sinister Mr. Blekinsop, the RAF veteran and substitute father-figure Frinton, are, like their creator, brilliant eccentrics. White insists on viewing the world from as skewed an angle as possible. Hardly a chapter goes by without an aside like "It [the door] glowed with secrecy and opulence, saying, 'Yes, in here.'"

As you might expect from this author, the nature of evil comes under examination. World domination is frowned upon, even for logical pacifist reasons. But would you kill a human being to prevent the Master from blackmailing the globe into submission with his tech- and nerve-jangling vibration generators?

Views on the races and sexes are typical of the period, and White is cheerfully reactionary in other ways. The Master's love for Bach's "bloodless fugues" is enough to condemn him, and needless to say "many scientists [are] unbalanced." The Master is a visit to another time, a small but charming country despite some unfortunate attitudes. - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2006/cur0608.htm[Thomas Marcinko]

From an armchair in England, Rosenblum hatches a complicated plot to return the world to the year 1580-reintroducing ruffs, doublets, codpieces, and sundry period diseases. By sheer force of will, Littlefield discovers that he's able to crystallize table salt into the shapes of "chickens and other small animals." Babson founds an international organization with the declared aim of annulling the law of gravity. These are only a few of the dozens of eccentrics, visionaries, and downright crackpots who populate the pages of Juan Rodolfo Wilcock's charming fiction in the form of a biographical dictionary. Temple's brief portraits blend mordant satire and profound imaginative sympathy, taking in the whole dazzling spectrum of human folly-including a handful of colors that only Wilcock's Swiftian eye could possibly have perceived. - https://www.amazon.com/Temple-Iconoclasts-J-Rodolfo-Wilcock/dp/1567925308/[Amazon blurb]

A FROG HOPS onto a park bench and sings "The Barber of Seville."

This sounds like the cartoon "One Froggy Evening" (1955), but it happened first in a novel published several months earlier. The Rolling Pin features an operatic frog named Turkey, a bench that acts like a choo-choo train, a dachshund who paints landscapes…and Looie, one of the funniest villains in fantasy literature.

The Rolling Pin, by Charles Williams, deserves a place beside Through the Looking-Glass and The Phantom Tollbooth. The story's narrator is Uncle Fritz, a bland Everyman whose life turns upside-down when he drops his stickpin. The pin hits the ground, and keeps rolling…and he follows it into some hilariously surrealistic adventures.

Charles Wilbur Williams (born in West Liberty, Iowa in 1917) was an Air Force radioman, a juvenile-court officer, a clarinetist, a carnival roustabout, a school principal in the U.S. and a teacher in Thailand, where he died in 1992. He published only two works of fantasy. It Was All Very Strange (1953) is his linked series of whimsical tall tales, just a notch below the sustained dementia of The Rolling Pin. His two fantasy books were published by Abelard-Schuman, which later imploded in a bankruptcy which has kept The Rolling Pin and It Was All Very Strange out of print ever since.

But Chuck Jones probably read this book. The last chapter of The Rolling Pin features Turkey the frog onstage in a dilapidated theater, singing "Figaro, Figaro, Figaro.…" - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2004/cur0403.htm[F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre]

Take a seat in the mind of our stealthy, cautious and sarcastic guide, "Lackadaisical Barry". His surreal trip is "filled to the brim" with macro observations of trivial day to day chores involving family responsibilities, loyal obligations to a friend and mystical slights of mind; all hampered by a job search. Whether it's a slow motion sail on the HMS Talbot or a brazen and thoughtless ride in Wayne's "Crown Vic"; a tussle with a monkey or a dreamlike romp with prancing lambs, it's all hilarious and tragic at the same time. Barry's carefully analyzed interactions with the variety of characters he must deal with seem to be experiments that are exhausting, treacherous, and unproductive. But, he floats on.

My interpretation of H.Williams style is some blend of Richard Russo's dusty wit and Monty Python's foolishness for the fun of it. His surgical word smithing scatters age old cliches like speed bumps in an unfamiliar road. If you go to fast it is your loss. So BUY THIS BOOK, take it slow and enjoy the ride around Needles, MA and to Exit 33B. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LS52LS6GCD7F/[Wayne Little]

*Love Is Forever - We Are for Tonight* (1970)

*****
CURTIS Books blurbed Love Is Forever—We Are for Tonight as "THE STRANGE AND FANTASTIC NOVEL OF A MAN TRAPPED IN AN INNER WORLD OF FEAR AND EVIL." It is, in truth, the autobiographical psychiatric case study of pulp sf writer Robert Moore Williams (1907-77). Think latter-day Heinlein crossed with L. Ron Hubbard and you won't go too far wrong.

The beginning place is early last-century Farmington, Missouri. But we are soon swept away on what the author himself calls a subvocal thought stream. Dianetics, UFOlogy, pre- and ante-natal memories ("Yes," a lawyer told Williams. "Yes. My mother's milk was poison to me."), desert communes, hallucinogenic gases ("I see Saturn in a cocked hat!"), Celtic melancholia, enemas, color projection instruments, and the italicized awareness of awareness center. I wouldn't be one bit surprised if Philip K. Dick had read this book long before he began VALIS.

Williams wrote some novels that deserve to be a lot more than little-known. The Blue Atom (1958) was inspired by his drug-induced view of the Solar System swimming in a soft blue light. The Day They H-Bombed Los Angeles (1962) is worthy of special praise; there's a clever catch in that catchpenny title. But Love Is Forever—We Are for Tonight captures his surely unique blend of madness and/or vision in its simon-pure form.

Semi-explanatory extract: "Our emotions remember the time before the beginning. Always is a meaningful word to them. Love is forever. But we children of ephemera, we are for tonight." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2007/cur0701.htm[Graham Andrews]

*****
By far one of the wittiest and wickedly funny explorations of the human condition I've read in a long time. It begins with what may (or not) be a simple act of kindness, namely the adoption of an abandoned child in the Amazonian rain-forest by a British zoologist, but quickly develops into a brutal but nonetheless side-splittingly funny analysis of human nature.

Brought to England to be raised and educated, Charlie, the principal character and narrator, suffers an unparalleled crisis of identity. Due to his somewhat unusual appearance i.e. bright orange skin, yellow eyes, virtually bald from head to toe, eventually growing to be over seven feet tall, not to mention other peculiarities of his anatomy, Charlie believes himself to be some sort of ape, and not of the human species.

Despite completing his education, getting a job, enjoying a number of relationships, and being obviously intelligent and articulate, this last trait being unique to humans, this is a question that is intentionally never truly resolved. Although not believing himself to be human, Charlie desperately wants to be accepted as such, or at least be accepted into human society. The problem facing Charlie is that he possesses none of the human character vices such as greed, anger, intolerance, aggression, and deceitfulness to name but a few, whilst at the same time being over endowed with an abundance of redeeming qualities such as empathy, kindness, and a distaste for violence of any kind. In his struggle to be human, Charlie tries to understand and embrace the former. It is hard for the reader not be sympathetic to his plight, whilst at the sane time secretly hoping that he fails, and retains everything that is good about himself.

The book itself has a very literary and academic feel to it yet still retains an easy to read style. If I had to express just one criticism it would be that perhaps the author's account of humanity is just a tad too pessimistic, but overall, a brilliant satire much in the vein of Swift's Gulliver's Travels, though with Swift it is more of a political satire; both comic and sad in equal measure, occasionally graphic though not obscenely so, this is a book that cleverly dissects human nature, and to a lesser extent, the academic world and society about him. Thoroughly enjoyable. - https://www.amazon.com/Mischief-Chris-Wilson/dp/058609203X/[RuddersReviews]

*****
In Eureka, Mississippi, the people are hardy, tough, used to heat, dust and drought, where "needles fare better than leaves". His "genes knitted from rainbow yarns", the light-skinned, mixed-race Leifur Nils Kristjansson Saint Marie du Cotton is born in 1950, Lee Cotton for short. Recessive genes render this southern child a confusing mix, "with buttermilk skin, azure blue eyes and straw-blonde hair". If his color, or lack of, doesn't get him into sufficient trouble, the voices he hears finish confuse him even more. Like his maternal grandmother, Lee is conversant with the spirits, living and dead, their cacophony joined with others in the all-black classroom he attends, making it all but impossible to attend to his lessons. Even in his youth, Lee intuits that his life will never be easy, part black, part white, and nowhere at home.

The future holds some hard knocks for Lee, as he is drawn to dangerous places, his skin color purchasing easy but dangerous passage. The spirit voices encourage his innocent curiosity, but the world is unforgiving, opportunistic and wasteful. Falling in love with the beautiful daughter of a rabid racist, Lee comes close to meeting his Maker, later to pass for white and gain employment in St. Louis, later still to assume yet another identity in San Francisco. Lee's road takes him far beyond the borders of normalcy, even to Nevada as a member of a secret psy-ops team, damaged but determined. This gender-bending tale of one man's changing identity would be grotesque if not for Wilson's humorous and brutally honest prose. From civil rights to Vietnam to feminism, Lee spins from one drama to another, that light-skinned, blonde-haired boy far from home when he pays a final visit home, adding another twist to an already addled past.

This is the South with all its pettiness and prejudices, brutality hiding behind a friendly smile, a man's hand as ready to stab as to shake, general meanness as common as a charm to ward off evil spirits. But these are Lee's people, the good, the bad and the ugly. Born into a world that does not easily accommodate him, Lee confronts every situation with a willingness to survive. Life is not a box of chocolates, nor is his existence simple, but this character has an unquenchable spirit, gripping a gris-gris in his fist as he marches into obstacles that would throw a lesser spirit. Adventure, romp, expose and debacle, the author's imagination conjures up a transcendental man with angelic pretensions, straddling the best and the worst of humanity. On the surface, this skin-color-sexual-orientation-morphing protagonist is patently absurd, but the story is written with such open-mindedness and good humor that it is hard to ignore the very real issues of racism, sexism and life from an ever-changing perspective. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YY7XAT0GG9LJ/[Luan Gaines]]

*****
This is a very dark comedy about the final days of the Stalin regime. The narrator is Yuri, a boy with brain damage and epilepsy who nonetheless is an observant and witty writer, far from the 'idiot' everyone presumes him to be. The title could refer to the city zoo that he lives at with his zookeeper father, or to human zoo of Stalin's inner circle. Through a twist of fate, Yuri is appointed food taster to Stalin, and as such witnesses all the machinations of the regime - even if he doesn't always comprehend what he has seen. Whilst there are very funny moments, and the writing style is full of wit, there underlying tone is very dark and the comedy simply casts the horrifying reality of the situation into a starker light. The whims of a dictator who had millions killed, and the vicious psychopaths who abetted him, are here for all to shudder over.

Yuri is a really likeable character as his father. Stalin is not sympathetic of course, but is certainly interesting, as are the men around him. His charisma comes across also, even though his behaviour is monstrous, you can get a feeling for why he was such a powerful cult figure and even Yuri can feel his influence. The ministers who surround him include some real and some fictitious characters - although I don't have any depth of knowledge about the period so there have been allusions that I missed.

In terms of the writing, it flows nicely and is easy to read. It's one of those books that engages you and gets you interested from the very beginning. It was certainly a novel that I wanted to keep reading and found gripping and compelling. Parts are really very funny, but there's an underlying menace that never goes away, even though Yuri himself doesn't always realise the peril he's in or see what's coming. In some ways this makes the reader feel more tense, as you feel a protective dread on behalf of the young narrator.

Anyone with an interest in Russia, the Soviet Union or politics more generally should read this - it's a fascinating book and there are likely even further levels within it that could be spotted by someone with more knowledge about the time, as with any satire. It's a satisfying if not always comfortable read that is both funny and shocking, and stands out in my memory as an original story. Anyone worried that it might 'make light' of the excesses of Stalin's regime can rest assured that the story does not do that. Highly recommended. - https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571334466/[BookWorm]

*Dr. Identify; or, Farewell to Plaquedemia* (2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933293322/[Amazon]

*****
"Plaquedemic and professor at Corndog University Dr. Blah Blah Blah sends his doppelganger, Dr. Identity, to teach a class for him, ending in disaster as Dr. Identity kills a prominent student. As Blah tries to figure out what to do, Identity takes the first steps toward a holocaust of epic proportions. Can the Dystopian Duo evade the scores of bounty hunters, the Law, and the Papanazi on their trail and continue their holocaustic ways?

Ever read a book and feel like your brain has been sexually assaulted? That's how I felt after reading Dr. Idenity. Dr. Identity is Snow Crash with a jetpack on its back, absurdism turned up to 111, crack igniting its bloodstream, and a stream of severed and mangled limbs trailing in its wake.

Harlan Wilson protrays a dystopian world of useless academics, trends that move at light speed, and a mass-media even more brainless they currently are. Dr. Identity acts as the raging Id of Dr. Blah Blah Blah's repressed ego, taking him on an odyssey of ultraviolence.

I can't hope to mention all of the things I loved about this book. I caught references to a lot of favorites, like Neuromancer, Snow Crash, the Hyperion Cantos, and all sorts of comics and movies. I loved that the Bobafett model of jetpack was the best on the market, that Bug Eyed Monsters attacked people who spent two much time shopping in Littleoldladyville, and that Dr. Blah Blah Blah read a Hardy Boys novel while Dr. Identity was murdering one of his student-things. Funny how both of my two most recent Bizarro reads mentioned The Hardy Boys.

That's about all. I'm drawing a blank on what to say next. Suffice to say, Dr. Identity is one hell of a Bizarro thrill ride and should appeal to fans of Philip K. Dick, cyberpunk, and distopia." - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KXAEZQXDCLKG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933293322[D. Schwent]

*Codename: Prague* (2011)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Codename-Prague-The-Scikungfi-Trilogy/dp/1935738046/[Amazon]

*****
"In this bizzaro novel, an agent, Vincent Prague, impossibly assassinates The Nowhere Man with predictable yet random results. He is now a celebrity but this has awful repercussions with his limbs and life in constant jeopardy. Luckily he carries around his own spare parts. Prague's mission is to crack a code but the plot isn't important to this novel. It is in the writing that the reader luxuriates: sometimes so weird it seems that D. Harlan Wilson's keyboard wrote the odd page by accident on its own, while others are a blend of streams of poetic consciousness.

Set in the near future and yet with many hark-backs to fifties detective genre, there is mild horror, science fiction and much humour on every page. Consider some examples: `The detectives were barely perceptible beneath the thick swathes of gore that caked them from fedora to flat feet.' And the whole of Chapter 06 reflecting on Prague's time in jail: `"Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, nrrrrrrr..."

He trailed off. He hadn't been counting long. But there was nothing else to do. He grew bored of the count quicker than desired or anticipated. How long had he been incarcerated here? No more than a few hours. Maybe just a few minutes. Now what could he do?

This is what happened next: eighteen years passed...'

There are notions in the novel that paint the protagonist and his milieu in certain lights. For example he often encounters German names and language. Who can't be fascinated by the way Germans accrete words so much a single word can't fit over a doorway. Eg Wütendeswissenschaftlermunster (mad scientist monster) - five times on one page! Brilliant. The guttural feel of the German voice is echoed in actions and clothing. Methinks D. Harlan Wilson, or at least his characters, lean in fashion towards Deutch Erwache regalia - or Nazi chic Sturmabteiling attire, in Prague's words.

A touch of SF is spiced through such as when Prague finds his shoelaces undone and he orders them to do themselves up. Weirdness can be equally relished in such descriptions as of a bell-hop's sister, whose breasts are filled with low-sodium peanut butter and `her hips swung like a pendulum as she walked'. I've been looking at the rear of women in a new way since I read that. Wonder if it'll wear off? Hope not.

Chapter 29 carries an editorial note that it should be deleted or the chapter should be the whole book. I can understand why - it is the epitome of bizarro - a long draught of `spenpalatine ganglionneuralgia (Margarita brain freeze) beautifully crafted.

The novel is full of stimulating one-liners - you don't drown in a puddle of True Romance and there is even a sentence thus ". . . . . . . . . . ." ie full of itself. Such self-referential sentences, worthy of Douglas Hofstadter, pervades this book. There's even a graphic chapter - chapter 48. I have to quote: `A man's shadow elected to cast the man...' Even the chapter numbers reach into decimal points then to negatives to the consternation of the narrator. Don't worry, there is a surprise at the end. You'd think a bizarro novel, where the joy is more in the reading than the plot, would not have a `proper' ending but you'd be wrong. A denouement unfolds with exposition guaranteed, but whether you'll agree with it is up to you. Like other books, once you've paid for it, and read it, then it belongs to you not the author.

My congratulations to D. Harlan Wilson for an entertaining, head-hurting flamboyance called Codename Prague."" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L35470H5WRTS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935738046[Geoff Nelder]

[[The_Kyoto_Man]]
*The Kyoto Man* (2013)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Kyoto-Man-Scikungfi-Trilogy/dp/1935738283/[Amazon]

*****
I first encountered the writing of D. Harlan Wilson in the pages of The Bizarro Starter Kit -Orange (Bizarro Books, 2006), which opens up with a handful of his short stories. In those pages, I visited the worlds of home-invading bodybuilders, mysterious characters battling for the rights to a piece of used chewing gum, and an entrepreneur who starts his own business selling facial hair as pets. The writing was fantastic and the images created in his stories were the kind that stuck with me and made me want more. I found more in The Kafka Effect (Eraserhead Press, 2001), a collection of Wilson's short stories that brought with it even stranger worlds and even more mind-twisting language, the kind that makes you re-think your opinion of the short story. However, I had never had the opportunity to experience his writing in the form of a novel until now, and I'm finding myself at a near-loss for words.

The Kyoto Man (Raw Dog Screaming Press, 2013) is the third in Wilson's Scikungfi trilogy (see also Dr. Identity and Codename Prague), the previous two installments being highly recommended books, but not at all prerequisites for this particular journey. Simply put, The Kyoto Man is the story of an unnamed man who inexplicably and uncontrollably becomes a city. And we're not talking metaphorically here, but metromorphically; our protagonist actually becomes the city of Kyoto, Japan, killing scores of people with each accidental transformation. Whether the transformations have to do with the Stick Figure War, or the subsequent timecrashes and zoneshifts, or the societal norm of schizophrenia and dreamless nights, he has at once become what legends are made of while at the same time seeking out psychological help in order to rediscover who "he" really is. Being that he has, in essence, become the most prolific, yet unwilling, serial killer in history (except when the transformation happened in the Florida wetlands), he also finds himself dodging enemies he may or may not have ever met.

The Kyoto Man is part sci-fi novel, part cult classic film (think Tetsuo - The Iron Man and the like) translated onto the printed page. Wilson divides the story up into chapters representing the different transformations into a city throughout the years, showing the very first metromorphosis as well as the apparent final time, while covering the span of over ten thousand more in between. The shifts in space and time due to the timecrashes and zoneshifts (eventually lumped together and abbreviated as "TCZ") find our protagonist in a variety of different settings, much like Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse-Five, but in a far more manic and chaotic kind of way.

The story in itself is fantastic, a great literary sci-fi novel with a good sense of humor about it. But add in the intelligent and witty touch of D. Harlan Wilson and it reaches mind-blowing greatness. Each chapter comes in a different form; sometimes it's the script for a sitcom, which is written in screenplay format complete with canned laughter, sometimes it's a panel from a comic book, complete with accompanying art. One chapter is written in flash fiction, one in the style of Cormac McCarthy (The Road), another in "hyperkinetic gorefest," still another in a very Faulkner-ian "Sound & Fury Disabled Remix." The variety not only adds to the genius of the novel, but helps keep up the schizophrenic feel as we jump from one place/time/style to another with each chapter.

Needless to say, the "rules" of writing fiction are broken throughout, something that will appeal to the less genre, more literary readers, while the result is sure to appeal to fans of Douglas Adams and Philip K. Dick. Beginning writers of fiction, especially sci-fi genre writers, are taught to avoid infodumps at all costs. What does Wilson do? Not only includes them, but specifically labels them as such throughout, giving the reader chunks of history relating to the Kyoto Man, the Stick Figure War, the timecrashes, etc. Depending on the section, our protagonist "becomes" a different person, being called different names by various characters. Words find their own unique spellings, recalling the guerilla punctuation tactics employed by Hubert Selby Jr (Last Exit To Brooklyn, Requiem For A Dream).

And then there is the cadre of historical, literary, and film characters who we meet along the space and time-bending road. In the very first chapter, our protagonist finds himself in a Road Warrior-like post-apocalyptic wasteland surrounded by a gang of physically deformed/altered attackers, one of whom resembles Dick Van Dyke. After being arrested for allegedly attempting to steal a supermarket, the man/city starts to be referred to as Snake Plissken. During a particularly revealing therapy session, "Sid," as he is temporarily known, confuses his own reality with that of Holden Caulfield, The Great Gatsby's Nick Carraway, and Steve McQueen's character in Bullitt. A recurring antagonist is Dr. Josef Mengele (Slayer's Angel of Death), while Arthur Miller, Oscar Wilde, and Rod Serling are all seen in passing. And the list goes on and on...

The Kyoto Man is a very well-written, very witty, self-described "pulp science fiction novel." While it is very intelligent, at no point does it take itself too seriously. Referencing the paperback version that I am reviewing, the author chose to include a blurb attributed to "satisfied reader" that reads as follows: "Pedestrian and irrelevant. Tripe. Guaranteed to never win the Pulitzer." While it may appear intimidating at first glance, once the style and format sink in it will pull you right along on the wild ride. Highly recommended, easily among the top three new books I've read in 2013. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9RZNC4ALYQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935738283&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[sean]

*****
The famed cartoonist turns his hand to prose in this book which is a parody of sensationalist literature and a wry, and often caustic, commentary on aspects and icons of modern society. Inside jokes abound on every page and in every character, but unless a reader is fairly well versed in the literature being parodied the book might come across as confusing, boring or gibberish. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson come across fairly well, I think, even to the casual reader, and perhaps Moriarty as well, in the characters of Enoch Bone, John Weston and The Professor; and I think most people should be able to see Art Waldo and Waldo World as stand-ins for Walt Disney and Disneyland. But the characters of The Mandarin and Spectrobert? Well, few people read Fu Manchu novels nowadays (most think it's just a moustache)and even fewer know of Fantomas. As far as the parodies of Ashton, Irene Adler and all the other minor characters drawn from mysteries, spy novels, adventure tales and American mid-century culture...most readers will give up, or, if persevering to the end, will wonder what they just read...you might feel like the only guy at the party who didn't get the joke. So, in that sense, the book just hobbles along till it comes to a truly amazing plot-twist of an end, which most people will get, even if they do not understand it. However, for the fan who has read read every word of Sherlock Holmes, Fu Manchu, and Fantomas, as well as devoured all the trashy sensationalist literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries...yeah, you'll get all the jokes, and appreciate the thrilling adventure presented by Wilson. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EU79TZ3FX390/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=089296295X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Ralph E.

[[Noctes_Ambrosianae]]
*Noctes  Ambrosianae* (?)

* *Vol. I - Aug. 1819 to Aug. 1824* (1854) - https://books.google.com/books?id=klEZAAAAYAAJ[+https://books.google.com/books?id=klEZAAAAYAAJ+]

*****
*Preface*

"Additional interest is given, by the recent death of Professor Wilson, to the present work. A complete edition of the Noctes Ambrosial (with notes and illustrations, necessary to a true understanding of the allusions with which the work is crowded, and the personal satire it contains) cannot be published in England for many years. In the lapse of time since the original appearance of " The Noctes" in Blackwood's Magazine, persons, localities, and circumstances therein mentioned or glanced at, have been so forgotten, altered, or obscured, as to require brief but sufficient explanations. A literary life, the greater part of which was passed in England and Scotland, has given me familiar acquaintance with most of the individuals and events treated of in this work, and has qualified me, I think, for the editorship which I have assumed.

Besides a History of Blackwood's Magazine, I have written memoirs of Wilson, Lockhart, Hogg and Maginn, the accredited authors of The Noctes. The engravings consist of a fine portrait of Wilson, (after Sir J. Watson Gordon, President of the Royal Scottish Academy,) with characteristic fulllength sketches, by Maclise and Skillin, of the other writers. There is also the fac-simile of a page of The Noctes in Professor Wilson's own writing.

I have endeavored to render this edition complete, by introducing the celebrated Chaldee Manuscript, full of satire and libel, which first brought BlackWood's Magazine into notoriety—was suppressed as soon as published—was afterwards boasted of as a brilliant jeu d'esprit,—and has been so scarce that the only copy I have ever seen, and I have long sought for it, was that from which I make the present reprint.

In August and September, 1819, nearly two years antecedent to the first of The Noctes, (which commenced in March, 1822, and closed in February, 1835,) there appeared a series of articles entitled " Christopher In The Tent," never before presented in this country, in any shape, which I have here introduced as properly prefatory, because the interlocutors in The Tent include the greater number of those who afterwards appeared in The Noctes. I have also inserted a satirical poem entitled " Metricum Symposium Ambrosianum," (originally intended as an addendum to No. III. of The Noctes,) in which there is a notice of every living British author of note, in the year 1822. This has never been reprinted in America, and I have copiously annotated it . The whole work has been very carefully revised from the original issue in the Magazine, whereby Wilson's peculiarities of composition and punctuation are fully preserved.

...

Let me conclude with a story and a moral:—In Ireland, during one of the agrarian insurrections of the last century, a banker in Galway, named French, was particularly disliked by the laboring classes. The Peep-o'-Day Boys, as "these sons of night" called themselves, resolved to ruin "that double-distilled villain, ould French." To do this effectually, whenever they visited the houses of the farmers and gentry, besides demanding arms and ammunition, they insisted on the surrender of such of French's bank-notes as were on hand. To show that it was not from a mere predatory motive, they used solemnly to burn the notes before the late possessors, exclaiming, as they were converted into ashes, "There—there's more ruin for ould French; we'll burn every note of his that's above ground, and not leave the villain a brass farthing." They pursued this vindictive game so successfully that, in the course of a year or two, Mr. French was some £4,000 richer—by the destruction of notes which he otherwise must have taken up and paid.

Most gentle public, have no hesitation in following this Peep-o'-Day example. Buy up all copies of The Noctes which may get into the market. Loan them not, so that others will be compelled to purchase also. If you clear away the whole of our large impression, believe that publisher and editor will submit to such "ruin," with the exemplary patience of martyrs."

*****
SECTION 42B of the Floral Disobedience Act plainly states that daisies must be 25.5mm apart—no more, no less. Snowflakes must conform with Registered Snowflake Design # 65537f (mid-gray). You'd know that if you had a copy of Chris Winn's 1985 book, Legal Daisy Spacing.

Not that that's all it covers. Nothing less than a manual of world improvements issued by the Build-A-Planet program, it gives directions on how to discipline barbaric deciduous trees, bottle tornadoes, bleach overly colorful rainbows, and deal with those nasty Bipedal Growths.

Winn is primarily an advertising illustrator, but his imagination runs pretty wild throughout the book. Nearly every other page has a drawing showing volcanoes being freshened, or parish churches being compressed.

So, why a book about this subject? The easy answer is that it's a comment on environmental issues, what with instructions for oiling shorelines and such, but Legal Daisy Spacing goes so far over the edge that easy answers are suspect. Madness is what it is; the madness, perhaps, of an advertising illustrator who just has to let go from time to time and do something really bizarre.

That, at least, is the result, regardless of the intent. It's a delightfully twisted little book that begs to be read aloud, especially at parties, and that also teaches us the importance of Build-A-Planet's motto, "Order Through Vigilance, Decency Through Purification."

*****
"A study of decay: mad, dissonant music; erotic perversion; widespread use of narcotics; dispossessed thinking; false conversions to Catholicism, and complex psychopathic personalities."

-Czeslaw Milosz on Insatiability

It's bad form to introduce a review with another review, but Milosz's concise summary can scarcely be improved upon. As a work of modernity and madness, Insatiability prefigures Gravity's Rainbow by half a century, and there is a certain resemblance between the two - the hypersexed antihero facing a crisis of self in the face of an overwhelming force, the young man in a historical moment headed for a schizoid breakdown, the biting social satire and grim humor and, not least, the secret transformation of civilization.

*spoilers ahead*

Insatiability takes place in a hypothetical late 20th century Poland. A quasi-Bolshevist Europe, and specifically a hedonistic Polish upper class, receives disturbing reports of an Asian tidal wave, an overwhelming Chinese army rolling in from the East, engulfing greater Russia and setting its sights on the puny European peninsula, bearing with it a new religion that utilizes a narcotic as a means of social control. Once again, Poland is the bulwark, the great plain through which the invaders must roll to get at the creamy center. But let's begin at the beginning...

When choosing my destiny, I choose insanity

-Tadeusz Micinski, quoted by Witkiewicz

Genezip (Zipcio) Kapen is marked from birth as a prodigal son, a Valentino-faced scion of the upper middle class drawn towards melancholy and the salon society of the nobility. By means of his repulsive and perverted older friend, the avant-garde composer Putricides Hardonne, he gains entry into the salon of the aging Princess di Ticonderoga, a "blue-eyed vulture" (one of the kinder descriptions) who adopts Zipcio as a sexual initiate, an indefatigable boy-toy. The first half of this long book is mostly taken up with this relationship and the yin-yang of attraction and repulsion he feels for this spoiled and decadent siren. In addition to Hardonne (who early on debauches the boy in the woods) and the Princess (who debauches him everywhere else) there is a bizarre cast of characters dizzying Genezip's mind with philosophies and perspectives which set the stage for his breakdown in the latter half of the novel. Insatiability is a sardonic and misanthropic novel with nary an attractive character, a cesspool of ideas in the form of Witkiewicz's extended rants and ramblings. Actual dialogue is minimal, and usually in the form of extended philosophical discussions, intellectual ramblings which bear little on the perverse passions which form the undercurrent of the interpersonal relations. Most of the pages are either Zipcio's interior monologue or pages upon pages of sarcastic third person observations on the grotesqueness and psychological vileness of the characters.

After Zipcio's awakenings in the first half of the novel, part two (titled "Insanity") follows him into young adulthood. The "Yellow Peril" has become all too real, and society braces for the impact. Genezip has been through school and is now a military officer. He becomes attached to the staff of the Quartermaster General Sloboluchowicz (the "Great Slob'), the dominant figure of the second half and a self-styled, self-assured Nietzschean superman whom Zipcio comes to idolize. Through his sister Lilian (for whom he, of course, has incestuous longing) and her connection with the theatre, Zipcio makes the acquaintance of the delectable Persy, who brings him to her rooms only to torture him with extended sexual teases, which give her a sadistic satisfaction. Zipcio is unaware that Persy is also the Great Slob's mistress, who, in the intervals of strenuous lovemaking sessions, rebuilds his lust by recounting her teasings of Zipcio. Finally, at one point, it appears that Zipcio can control himself no longer and is on the verge of rape when Persy leaves the room. From another door enters another man, an adjunct of Sloboluchowicz, who has been spying on the two under orders of the General. Perhaps as a result of his own arousal from viewing the proceedings, he approaches Zipcio with clearly unwholesome intent. Zipcio picks up a hammer and buries it in the man's temple. He leaves, disoriented but remorseless, and by lucky turn of fate guerilla warfare between rival factions begins that very night. Zenezip is wounded and wakes up in an infirmary.

He finds himself in the care of the gentle and virginal Eliza. Following the murder, Zipcio has experienced a breakdown of sorts, a disassociation from reality. He sees in Eliza a boundless calm and none of the guile that has characterized the women with whom he has heretofore associated. Eliza explains that she is a convert to a new religion, a religion that takes the form of mysterious pills dispensed by an Indian named Djevani, who is a sort of advance man, an infiltrator spreading the neo-Buddhist gospel of Murti-Bingism through Davamesque B2, a pill that takes away the anxieties and concerns of philosophy, the obsessions and insatiabilities of the artist and the intellectual, by revealing the "Grand Truth". Zipcio partakes of the drug and experiences a mind-bending alteration of reality, which leaves him in a schizoid state, by turns docile and psychotically manic.

Zipcio keeps his hands off Eliza, mostly worshiping her virginity and wondering at her inner peace, but also bearing silent witness to a certain contempt of her. Finally, on their wedding night, they consummates their relationship, an act which turns Eliza sexually ravenous - in a word, insatiable. In the heat of sex giving way to his revulsion of her, Zipcio grips his hands around Eliza's throat and strangles her in a last erotic convulsion. He rises the next morning, puts on his uniform, informs the desk that Madame will be staying an extra day, and calmly leaves to join his unit. He travels with Persy and the Great Slob to Polish Byelorussia, where a minor Armageddon is to be staged in the face of the advancing Chinese (the acknowledgement of this second murder is taken calmly by the Great Slob, as he is certain that Zipcio will perish at the front anyway along with the rest of the army, obviating the need for punishment). But it turns out that the Great Slob himself has partaken of Davamesque B2 as well. He knows that resistance to the Chinese is futile, and that his army will be slaughtered. At this point, under the influence, this great leader who has planned martyrdom and a blaze of glory for himself makes the astonishing decision to surrender. Despite angry rebellion by other units in the Polish army, the deed is done, and the group is taken to the camp of the Chinese general, where a group of Chinese are being lazily beheaded for minor infractions in the preparation for a battle that never takes place. Sloboluchowicz has assured himself that a man of his experience, stature and charisma will be invaluable to the Chinese, but he allows no show of emotion when he is calmly informed that they really have no use for him, and he is taken out to be summarily decapitated. In the aftermath, Zipcio, after a brief emotionless fling with Persy, takes up his new position in the new order, a "consummate lunatic, a mild catatonic" and is forcibly married off to a noble Chinese beauty. The new devotees of Murti-Bing, freed of unproductive intellectual inquiry and decadent Western ennui, take their assigned places in the new order.

A summary of the main narrative of Insatiability hardly does the book justice. The neologisms, the obscenities, the mad jargon, poisonous satire, and tooth-grinding contempt of Wikiewicz for the banal shine forth crazily from every dark page. Insatiablity flows forth like a manuscript smuggled out of an asylum, a bizarre, unique document of the early 20th century avant-garde, and a work of breathtaking genius, decades ahead of its time. In a strange coda for one who had created such a novel, Stanislaw Witkiewicz committed suicide at the Russian border upon learning of the Soviet invasion of Poland. Later investigation, it is said, revealed that his coffin held the body of an unknown woman. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R34IQ348NK4H0N/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810111349&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[makifat]

*****
"Fade Out is, in the words of the Village Voice, the "comic masterpiece of one of contemporary America's long-neglected geniuses." First published in 1959, it is a stunning, surreal criticism of American life in the materialistic, youth-and money-crazed 1950s. Its hero is Dick Twombley, a 74-year old retired bank clerk who struggles to retain what remains of his dignity in a world that regards old age as an embarrassment. When he is mistakenly accused of kidnapping two little girls he has befriended, Dick's daughter packs him off to a suburban New York City retirement home. He soon makes his escape with the help of a fellow inmate, and together the two "fugitives from injustice" embark on a cross-country odyssey that lands them in the abandoned hotel of an Arizona ghost town.It's the end of the road, but it's also a new home, and a place of idiosyncratic spiritual rebirth. As Robert Creeley said, "It is [Dick's] sincere acceptance of what he's been given, his fascination with what he can make of it," that allows him to accept deprivation as happiness, without irony or satire. "Woolf's hero is a [kind of] Don Quixote, who even when defeated still hears the echoes of his transforming dreams."" - https://books.google.com/books/about/Fade_Out.html?id=mFPCEGiTPJwC[Google Books]

[[Islandia]]
*Islandia* (1910)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585671487/qid=1063745709/[Amazon]

*****
Ever fall so in love with a place that you couldn't stop writing about it, obsessively cataloging every tiny detail and studying every aspect of it until you're left with a giant brick of a manuscript that could successfully anchor a ship at harbor? People might say that you're a little quirky, frankly. Now imagine you made that place up entirely, and your name isn't Tolkien. Now people would say you're a quirky writer with a lot of free time.

But it's actually not quite that simple. Austin Tappan Wright was a lawyer and law professor in the early part of the 20th century. Like a lot of kids who didn't have videogames and were dealing with a world still consisting of chunks that said "I don't know what's here" he decided to make up a nifty place. But instead of populating it with giant dinosaurs (and thus predicting my childhood) as he got older he imbued it with more and more details, coming up with a culture and language and history and eventually putting all those details into the form of a giant novel featuring an American who would come to visit this land he called Islandia, where the wind goes whistling past the farms. Despite being fairly busy in his job and having a family he managed to complete a six hundred thousand word novel before tragically being killed in a car accident in the early 1930s. It went unpublished until about ten years later when his wife and daughter edited it down to gigantic instead of intimidatingly daunting (it's still about a thousand pages) and it's been considered a classic of utopian fiction ever since, although it seems to be out of print now.

The term "utopian fiction", for me at least, conjures an airy type of land where everything is magical and wonderful all the time, with an attitude that borders on the dippy as everyone strive to get "back to nature" and "live simply" and it makes perfect sense because it's fiction and everything can turn out how the author wants all the time. I didn't expect anything of the complexity of Ursula Le Guin's analysis of utopias "The Dispossessed", fancying this to be mostly a romp where the American character marvels at how amazing everything is all the time, and everyone patronizes his strange ways. A thousand pages of that might have been unbearable. Fortunately, that isn't quite the case.

I should take a second to note that if you do make it through this novel you owe a silent thanks to Wright's wife and daughter, who carved a readable novel out of the reams of notes that he left behind. In the afterword his daughter notes that most of the excised text was descriptions of the land as the main character, John Lang, travels through it, written in an unhurried style. Being that the book as it exists trundles along at what can be politely described as a leisurely pace, it must be a roadrunner compared to its original form. We don't know if this is the exact form that Wright's novel would have taken if he had lived long enough to edit it himself (if he had even published it, or been able to bring himself to cut anything out) and while the text here is all his, his family should be given some credit in giving it this final shape.

The novel does describe the adventures of one John Lang, an American who gets appointed as a consul to the mysterious land of Islandia, part of another continent that seemed entirely plausible in 1910, when this novel takes place. Islandia is fairly isolationist, only allowing about a hundred foreigners at a time in the country and while Lang is expected to investigate the possibility of opening up business interests there and maybe bringing this backwards place into the totally modern world of 1910, he finds himself exploring the land with an Islandian man he went to Harvard with, getting involved in their politics, learning about their culture and falling in love with all of their women. Sometimes even in that order.

As I hinted, this is not a fast-paced novel and even if the thousand page count didn't tip you off, reading about ten pages should decide whether this is something you want to spend a lot of time with. Written not unlike the style of a Victorian novel, it's all first person and quite, quite leisurely, barely raising its heartrate over a mere flutter, taking its time to revel in its deliberate pace, a speed that frankly matches the land itself. Lang goes from farm to farm, situation to situation, meeting some people and staying with them a bit before moving onto the next family. There's no real overarching plot beyond the evolution of Lang's relationship to the country, but it's not quite a travelogue either. Wright is clearly interested in showing this place off, but one gets a sense that he's exploring it as well, enjoying journeying amongst the farms and lands that for so long existed only in his head. It lends a very relaxed feel to the pace that might turn off some readers used to a zippier style of writing, although anyone that has spent some time reading Dickens might find themselves more at home here.

Yet, it works, to some extent, to a much greater extent than I expecting. I consumed the novel in hundred page chunks at a time and it's quite possible the novel is best experienced as a steady drip of details because the overall effect can be overwhelming if devoured all at once. Suffice to say, Wright has a wealth of information ready to impart about his pet land and what we've given in the story is probably only the proverbial tip of the iceberg. The Tolkien comparison may be easy but it's quite clear that Wright has thought out every possible aspect of the land , and the story reflects that. The place feels real, fully conceived and lived-in, and because we spend so much time there in the course of the novel, it gives the reader a chance to really immerse themselves in the place, with the slow pace allowing everything to sink in. I don't know if it's a place I want to live but if the ultimate goal of fiction is to transport someone to a place they wouldn't be able to experience otherewise, then Wright succeeded beyond his dreams. There's a weight to every location and how it all interlocks that has the ring of truth about it. I imagine more sophisticated authors these days could do some quibbling with ecology or the nature of the language but the triumph here is that sense of reality.

Still, while it's nice to read about The Best Place Ever, is the story any good? It's . . . decent. Wright takes an interesting tactic and appears to be challenging himself on whether this agrarian utopia would actually work. While good chunks of the story are concerned with the land itself, he takes time to let Lang become completely immersed in the culture, venturing from the City to the farms to the rocky border to the south where the wily Germans are trying to get in. The sprawling nature of it means that the story does suffer from a lack of focus in terms of outside factors . . . a treaty challenge is resolved fairly handily and even some concerns about an invasion are more or less dropped later. The story makes it seem like it might be about Islandia defending its way of life against outside incursions, i.e. the modern world, but its quiet confidence in its own way of life means that isn't necessarily a real concern. They deal with it and let it fall away, much like anything else. In that sense, the story becomes more about Lang and how the country changes him, turning him away from the crazed hectic life of Victorian times (relatively speaking) into the quieter and more deliberate world of Islandia, where hard work and contemplation rule.

What makes it interesting to me is Wright's attempts at emotional complexity, as he not only details a world where everyone is okay with being a farmer all the time, but an entirely different worldview, where love can be one of four words and the barriers between people aren't quite the same as back home. Islandia is a more sexually permissive society and he contrasts that with the Victorian obsession toward social morality, never quite devolving into "do what feels right", but clearly skewing the vote toward the Islandian side. One of the aspects of the book that a patient reader will have to swallow is that Lang, a young repressed American, is basically the Archie Andrews of the early 1900s and spends a good portion of the book literally falling in love with every girl he sees, and having convulsions of contradictory emotions about it. To Wright's credit, it never becomes a bodice-ripper and its impressive how he confronts the misunderstandings and hurt feelings that can result from such things, while also allowing two people to have some incredibly emotionally bare conversations about love and lust and how two adults who fancy each other should interact. Of course,the fact that this happens about six times in the book may be trying and after reading another fifty page sequence where Lang moons on and off over an Islandian girl, you want to reach through the pages and slap him so he'll get over it already.

Impressively enough, though, it's not a huge love letter to Islandia. For all he feels that the way of life here is perfect, he's not blind to the faults and he does his best to populate it with imperfect people who perhaps strive a little harder than we do to be better. The people who live in the land are quite aware of how hard it is to maintain the way of life they enjoy and also seem acutely aware of how easily it can be lost. He confronts the potential downsides of such an existence, acknowledging that it isn't for everyone, and instead of being treated to someone telling you over and over again how perfect it all is, you get something a bit more nuanced, an honest depiction of a way of life that has its own routines and traditions. One of the nice things about the length of the novel is how familiar those routines feel by the end of it, the changing of the seasons, the tasks needed to be done on the farms . . . the land feels lived-in and there's a feel of truth about it as people ride from farm to farm, as they meet each other and part only to meet again later. It has the sense and feel of life, of how it continues even when we're not around and can stretch for years in either direction.

It's episodic and if you stomach its casual canter aware that it will never result in a true climax (there's a smattering of action but nothing too exciting), it may be worth attempting. It's of its time for sure (you get about ten pages in before someone charmingly brings up "the blacks") but it's of a time so vanished that even the people who lived directly in the wake of it could barely remember what it was like, the lost years in flux between the world wars, with the veneer of the 19th century already eroding so rapidly to show the bare bone underneath that would form the ramshackle skeleton of our blood soaked century. It doesn't so much end as fade out, with Lang finding love in the only way that makes sense, not as culmination but continuation, both sensual and mundane and the unspoken thought as it concludes in quiet calm isn't so much "Why isn't this real?" as "Why is it?" It's a tempting life, but so specifically geared to a certain time and place and people that even the best Wright can do is be a tourist, trying to pour concrete around his dreams to define it better. But its unique solidity speaks to its dissolution. It could exist forever in a shade of hope, and still not be made for those times. - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R217CO4IHAJM7F/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1585671487[Michael Battaglia]

*****
"JOG Rummage. The name of a place, or a peculiar kind of bake sale? Not so. Jog Rummage is our hero, a hedgehog. Along with the Rats, the Jogs occupy a strange and eerie landscape: their world is capped by Shadow, divided into two kingdoms by a narrow "sea," lit only by a Moon and a Great Star, and infested with deadly Swoops. Rummage is a poet and scholar. When war with the egregious Rats arrives, he plays his part, helping to cement a peace known as the New Existence afterwards. But the world of Jog Rummage is about to undergo a shattering cataclysm, under the feet of the monster, Horribilis.

Elizabeth Morgan is a freakishly imaginative crippled youngster living with her equally damaged father. Obsessed with the mysterious past that has led to her father's blighted condition, Elizabeth frequents a patch of rubble-filled ground where her father's business once stood. Intrigued by a hole leading into the Earth, Elizabeth descends on an Orphic odyssey.

How these two scenarios mesh forms the essential mystery of this first—and apparently only—novel by Grahame Wright. The solution's not much of a shocker, but the readability of the book—published when Wright was only twenty-seven—remains high, thanks to its fusion of Tolkien and Peake. Toss in Jog Rummage's classic and climactic conceptual breakthrough for a stefnal flavor, and we mourn the fact that Wright seemingly abandoned fiction, despite the book's dustjacket claim that he was working on a second novel" - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2005/cur0507.htm[Paul Di Filippo]

[[Going_Native]]
*Going Native* (2005)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Going-Native-Stephen-Wright/dp/140007942X[Amazon]

*****
This complex novel, roughly three hundred pages in length, follows the travels of Wylie Jones. Jones has the current cliché American Dream: a wife, two kids, nice house, nice job, nice car. Nonetheless, after witnessing the aftermath of a 7-11 murder, he decides to hit the road. As with all things in the novel, his reasons are ambiguous. He's hitting the road and heading for California, taking his sweet time getting there but heading steadily for it. In each place he goes, he finds himself trapped in a different reality, each one less pleasant than the last, until he finds himself, in an Eastern way, having gone full circle.

And yet the story is told not from the Jones' perspective, but instead from the perspective of a series of characters whose lives intersect his. The first chapter is told by his wife, the next by the crack dealer he steals the 69 Galaxie from, the third by a serial-killer hitchhiker, and the fourth by a motel manager who wants nothing more in life than to write blockbusters. The fifth chapter follows an out-of-control, porn-star party; the sixth a Las Vegas lesbian couple; and the seventh the journey of man and wife B-movie stars to Indonesia in an attempt to cleanse their souls. Finally, this narrative collage ends centered on a man trapped in his Los Angeles life.

Each chapter reads more like a long short story than an episode of a novel, and that forms the weakest and most inaccessible aspect of the novel: if you're not careful, you may end up putting down a wonderful book because you think it's disjointed. But when you reach the end, the puzzle is solved; the main character is revealed and shown for what he really is.

We don't see this from his eyes until the end. We watch it from the eyes of the people around him, each of them searching for themselves inside of their lives. They all try to live their dreams, lead happy lives: ironically, the very thing that Wylie had to start with.

The book has more irony laced in it than an analysis of an acid trip, which, like Thomas Pynchon's 'Gravity's Rainbow' (1979), is exactly what it feels like. (The comparison between Wright and Pynchon is appropriate: this guy is in Pynchon's league.) Despite a tendency to write like a series of short stories, Stephen Wright has tales to tell and says them with loud, evocative prose that wards off boredom with a branding iron and makes you want to read more.

'Going Native' possesses both the crude, offensive, and blaring nature to hold the interest of a Stephen King fan as well as sufficient ironic wit, intelligence, and bizarre brilliance to keep those of us who finished Don DeLillo's 'Underworld' (1997) interested. Stephen Wright is in the vanguard of young postmodernists and 'Going Native' is an overlooked gem to add to your collection. - http://www.amazon.com/Going-Native-Stephen-Wright/product-reviews/140007942X/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending[Carson Durant]

*****
"Wright's title refers to a racist editorial cartoon of the period, which depicted "an amalgamation polka," where whites and blacks dance together in genteel costumes. This was meant to suggest, one presumes, that other mutually enjoyable physical activities might occur between the races later in the evening. Race mixing was the great shibboleth of slavery advocates and segregationists from the dawn of American history almost to our own time and many of the characters in Wright's novel are obsessed with it." Andrew O'Hehir

Stephen Wright is one of my favorite authors. I was introduced to him by my best friend who recommended his book "Going Native". I read this book in almost one sitting ten months ago but left the last chapter until now. I wanted to be able to leave the last chapter for a time when I needed solace and understanding. Who else will tell you that our country is screwed, always has been and always will be. Who else, as in most of his novels, infers that this 'is both the real thing and a merciless parody'? And, who else writes such marvelous prose? Exactly, maybe no one.

Liberty Fish, yes that is his real name, grows up in a house used as a station on the Underground Railroad, but his mother was raised on a large South Carolina plantation and his father is the son of a Northern industrial family that has profited greatly from the slave trade. Liberty's parents want to destroy the institution that made their families rich, and this perversity runs through the book. When Liberty visits the devastated Redemption Hall, his mother's birthplace, and meets his maternal grandfather, Asa Maury, the old man is a bitter, angry, hardened bigot. Yet, faced with the destruction of slavery, he is facing the racial dilemma, and is trying to solve it. Liberty survives the horrors of war at Antietam. He is taken prisoner by the rebels, then deserts from the Union Army to go find grandfather Asa. There he works with his grandfather to escape the collapsing Confederacy and hijack a ship for Brazil, where slavery remains alive and well. This harkens us back to Liberty's childhood where he is educated by a one-eyed former slave named Euclid, taken carousing by his Uncle Potter and sworn into the secret fraternity of pirates by a strange character Fife. Where does this all take us? That journey, my friend, is for you take.

Stephen Wright may see bloodshed and tumult of the Civil War period as good examples of our American madness. Despite the parody or maybe because of it, Stephen Wright gives us a new vocabulary, 'sheconnery', 'buckra, and 'gallinipers'. Fitting words for the occasion. What do they mean? You decide.

One of the characters, a southern lady sums this book up the best 'This war,'" she says to Liberty, "'this horrible evil war, it's never going to end. You do understand that, don't you? Even after it's over it will continue to go on without the flags and the trumpets and the armies, do you understand?'

There is so much to say about this novel. Stephen Wright may be having as much difficulty as we are in understanding what is happening in our world today, but he is able to articulate his thoughts in remarkable prose. I do not have the words to express the mastery of Stephen Wright's prose,nor will I try. Suffice it to say that he has led Liberty to the conclusion that "Life ... makes mongrels of us all." - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BSEHBE59JHJK/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679772944[prisrob]

[[Nog]]
*Nog* (1969)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Nog-Rudolph-Wurlitzer/dp/0982015127/[Amazon]

*****
Reading "Nog" is a little like living in the mind of Zen monk strung out on drugs. Whatever, whoever Nog is, I'm not sure that he's human. If a human being is one step removed from reality-having to interpret the physical world through the senses and through the mind-then Nog is about four or five steps removed. Impressions from the world come in, bounce around inside his cavernous mind and finally end up distorted beyond recognition, which is where the fun begins.

Nog strives to maintain a maximum of three memories, considers facts subjective, and will not, under any circumstances, give out information. But don't get him started on the octopus...

"He kept complaining about a yellow light that had been streaming out of his chest from a spot the size of a half dollar. We drank and talked about the spot and the small burning sensation it gave him early in the morning and about his octopus. He had become disillusioned about traveling with the octopus and had begun having aggressive dreams about it. He wanted to sell it."

Rudolph Wurlitzer's style is reminiscent of other writers of the era-Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, et cetera-and the novel's genre is the good old American "yarn." As with Mark Twain, Wurlitzer just wants to keep pulling your leg as long as you'll let him. This sort of thing is difficult to sustain outside the confines of a short story, however-and, like some of Twain's novels, "Nog" does lose a bit of its steam somewhere. The opening of the book is absolutely priceless, but soon Wurlitzer must do something to up the ante in his narrative con game. This, unfortunately, means falling back on an listless plot to move Nog around and add fodder to that bizarre imagination. If "Nog" never quite surpasses the flair of the opening chapters, Wurlitzer has still achieved a deliciously eccentric style and created one truly unforgettable character. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EWQLW5349FNY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982015127&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

*****
Rudolph Wurlitzer in an American screenwriter and author who was at various times praised by the king of post-modern lit. himself, Thomas Pynchon. He also happens to be heir to the Wurlitzer fortune but, by his own account, he couldn't take advantage of it as his father had done that already. At some stage Wurlitzer took a quasi-mythical spiritual journey through Asia, following the death of his 21-yo son. His only non-fiction oeuvre, `Hard Travel to Sacred Places' is in fact based on that travel.

There is one more anecdote worth recounting, partly because it contributes to a quite interesting life and partly because it's directly linked to `The Drop Edge of Yonder', the subject of this review: Rudolph Wurlitzer used to be pal with Jim Jarmusch. The friendship abruptly ended when Jarmusch, without Wurlitzer's knowledge, based his now-legendary fim `Dead Man' on a screenplay that the author had been working on, titled `Zebulon'.

Allegedly Wurlitzer considered suing but then, deciding the better of it, ended up extracting a novel out of his former screenplay and that novel goes by the title of `The Drop Edge of Yonder'.

It's a great work of fiction, a mystic western that is equal parts Cormac McCarthy (circa `Blood Meridian') and Jodorowsky.

The novel stars Zebulon Shook: mountain man, pelt trader, outlaw and trapper, Zebulon has been cursed by a half-breed Shoshoni woman and, as a consequence, he's trapped between the worlds. This circumstance allows for a mythical journey across the American Frontier to take place. Zebulon is not alone in this. The cast is made of many characters, ranging from the grandiose (count Ivan Baronofsky) to the deranged (Plug), from the sensual (the Abyssinian courtesan, possibly witch, Delilah) to the ruthless (The Warden, a character that reminded me of McCarthy's Judge).

Along the way there is room for beautiful descriptive passages, mindless violence (again, delivered in the same dry, matter-of-factish way that McCarthy employed), comedy and a desperate urge to be free, one of the genre's archetypal themes.

Not that there is much within `The Drop Edge...' that would fit in your average Far West adventure. The offbeat characters and the mythical vibe make for a much different read but, again, it's a great one. - http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQWKRUOY3WL1/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=097638955X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Simone Oltolina]

*****
"DORNFORD Yates (real name Cecil Mercer) retains a cult following for two linked fiction series, both very English: the Chandos thrillers and the Berry comedies of upper-class misadventure.

His little-known The Stolen March has Berry connections and begins with high-spirited criminal capers on a Continental tour, bringing together two young couples who then stumble into the lost country of Etchechuria.

This lies between France and Spain, hidden by compass-jamming magnetic mountains and by magic. It's a medieval fairyland, where visitors must outwit malign dwarfs and be equally wary of ogres and husband-hungry princesses. Further devices include shape-changing, talking animals, invisibility cloaks and the Philosopher's Stone.

As in the Alice books, inhabitants are addicted to lunatic whimsy and logic-chopping. A manufacturing town is named Date because, naturally, "All the best stuff's out of Date." Nursery-rhyme allusions abound.

One visitor can out-talk the gabby natives: Pomfret, whose grumpy magniloquence is reminiscent of Yates's Berry, the English squire. Like Berry, he's fond of comparing people to "blue-based baboons"; unlike Berry, he's threatened with transformation into one.…

Eventually the country's hospitality becomes overwhelming. Unwanted honors must be accepted on pain of death. A madcap chase sequence ensues as our outlawed tourists flee through glowing rustic scenery: Yates loved descriptive ecstasies about both landscape and women. All ends idyllically, thanks to creative real-world use of the Midas touch.

Somehow the Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997), though mentioning Yates in passing, missed this comic fairytale." - https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2008/cur0805.htm[David Langford]

*The Carnal Prayer Mat* (17th century, 1996)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Carnal-Prayer-Mat-Li-Yu/dp/0824817982/[Amazon]

*****
This is a review of The Carnal Prayer Mat by the seventeenth-century Chinese author Li Yu, in the translation by Patrick Hanan. (In Chinese, family names are written first, so the author's surname is "Li.")

This book is a classic that is sexy, witty, fast-paced and fun to read even if you don't like "classics." It also has interesting philosophical aspects that raise it above the level of simply an entertaining read. Some of these philosophical points are raised in the "Critique" sections that come at the end of every chapter (probably written by a friend of Li Yu's). You should be warned that this IS an erotic novel. It is not any more graphic than lots of popular novels today, but if you are offended by explicit sexual discussions, you should not read it.

The novel's main character is Vesperus, an extremely talented scholar who has two ambitions in life: "to be the most brilliant poet in the world" and "to marry the most beautiful girl in the world" (p. 24). Vesperus is warned by the Buddhist monk Lone Peak that this second quest will lead him to numerous wicked acts. Because he wants only the most beautiful woman, he will never be satisfied with any woman he marries, and will even commit adultery with other married women if they seem more beautiful to him. And because of the law of karmic retribution, Vesperus will be punished, either in this life or the next, for his evil deeds. Vesperus scoffs at this admonition, so Lone Peak advises, "gain your enlightenment on the carnal prayer mat; then you'll discover the truth" (p. 30).

What makes this novel so philosophically interesting is that we're never sure quite what perspective the novel takes on all this. At a surface level, the novel is a straightforward moral tale. In an introductory chapter, Li Yu tells us that he wants to teach people that a moderate amount of sex within marriage is good, but that excessive sex or sex outside of marriage is dangerous. He claims that his explicit sexual descriptions "are all designed to lure people into reading on until they reach the denouement, at which point they will understand the meaning of retribution and take heed" (p. 11). And, indeed, the life of Vesperus does follow a path that suggests such a message.

However, there is much in the text that is potentially subversive. For example, Vesperus learns, to his surprise, that he is very poorly endowed compared to most men. Li Yu describes this as an opportunity for him to curb his inappropriate lust, comparing him to two Confucian sages noted for their sexual restraint: "Who knows, perhaps Lu Nanzi, who shut his door against an importunate widow, and Liuxia Hui, who kept his self-control with a girl on his knee, may have shared these very thoughts of his, thoughts that may have made them the leading paragons of all time" (pp. 105-106). Chinese thinkers were sophisticated enough to realize that virtue requires appropriate motivation, and that fear of sexual inadequacy is not a virtuous motivation for sexual restraint.

In addition, Li Yu advises us, "Clearly it is wrong to study the bedroom art, for once learned, it tends to corrupt our thinking" (p. 117). But this novel itself is, in part, a treatise on "the bedroom art." There are learned disquisitions on the proper use of pillows in positioning a woman's body (p. 151 ff.), on the advantages of plumper women over skinnier ones in bed (p. 253 ff.), and on the importance of women taking an active role during intercourse, as by "Lowering the Yin to Join the Yang" (i.e., female superior position; p. 280 ff.).

The novel also makes extensive plays on the Confucian classics in ways that sometimes suggest subversive irreverence. Many of these references are to the ancient Confucian Mengzi (also known as Mencius). In fact, Li Yu explicitly compares himself to Mencius (pp. 9-11), who avoided taking an overly puritanical tone with a ruler fond of sex, in order to more successfully direct him toward benevolent government. (See Philip J. Ivanhoe and Bryan W. Van Norden, eds. Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy, reprint [Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2003], p. 120.) The learned translator, Patrick Hanan, catches many such references, but I suspect that he misses a few. For instance, Vesperus's wife reads some erotic novels, and notices that the men in the stories are described as being much better endowed than her husband. She is not sure what to make of this, since she has never been with another man. She concludes, "Better to have no books at all then to believe everything you read" (p. 207). Hanan puts this in quotation marks, so he recognizes that it is a quotation from something. In fact, it is probably from Mencius 7B3, in which he comments on the Book of History. Drawing this parallel hints that the Confucian classic, the Book of History, is on a level ethically and intellectually with popular erotica (such as The Carnal Prayer Mat itself).

But a simple subversive reading seems inadequate too. The eventual downfall of Vesperus and those whom he entangles in his web is artfully complex, but it does not seem contrived or implausible. In a truly great novel, the author does not try to force the characters to illustrate any particular moral. He creates them and lets them do what they must do, given who they are and the situations they are in. Great novels are ethically complex because life is ethically complex. The Carnal Prayer Mat achieves this kind of greatness, but for that reason it defies easy ethical summation. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VB709SQEUUXI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0824817982&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Doc Caligari]

Zamyatin, Yevgeny (1884-1937)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[We]]
*We* (1988, Russia)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/We-Yevgeny-Zamyatin/dp/0140185852/[Amazon]

*****
The Beatles' "I am the Walrus" provides some flavor for the atmosphere of the futuristic society found in Yevgeny Zamyatin's dystopian classic "WE". Written in the fledgling Soviet Union in 1920 "WE" had a direct influence n Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Ayn Rand's Anthem. In fact, Rand's Anthem tracks "WE" so closely both as to plot and character development that one cannot help but think that Zamyatin's influence on Rand was significant, to say the least.

Zamyatin was born in 1884 and studied naval engineering as a young man. Like many young Russian intellectuals Zamyatin was something of a revolutionary. He was arrested and exiled more than once by the Tsar's secret police for revolutionary activities. During the First World War Zamyatin, by now a naval enginner, was sent to England were he supervised the construction of icebreakers for the Russian navy. He returned to Russia upon the outbreak of the October 1917 revolution. Zamyatin turned to writing full time after the revolution. Although a Bolshevik, Zamyatin chafed at the increasing censorship the Bolsheviks imposed on artists and writers. WE was the first novel to be banned by the newly formed literary censorship board, GLAVLIT. WE was not officially published in Russia or the USSR until 1988. Not able to earn a living as a writer in the USSR, Zamyatin applied for an exit visa. Zamyatin was granted an exit visa and he emigrated to Paris, were he died a sick and poverty stricken man in 1937.

WE takes place in the twenty-sixth century where a totalitarian regime has created an extremely regimented society where individual expression simply does not exist. All remnants of individuality have been stripped from its inhabitants including their names. Their names have been replaced with an alpha-numeric system. People are not coupled. Rather, each individual is assigned three friends with whom they can have intimate relations on a rigid schedule established by the state. Those scheduled assignations are the only times the shades in a citizen's glass houses can be closed. Apart from those hourly intervals everyone's life is monitored by the state. As in Orwell's 1984, language has been turned on its head. Freedom means unhappiness and conformity and the submission of individual will to the state means happiness.

D-503 is a mathematician. He is busily engaged working on the construction of a spaceship, the Integral, which will carry the wonderful benefits of "The One State" to those living on distant planets. He keeps a diary to provide a record of his feelings in the weeks before the launch. But into his perfectly well-structured life walks I-330. She evokes in D-503 feelings which he has long suppressed or never knew he had. He falls in love, can't sleep, and starts breaking rules and generally acting like most of us do today. But I-330 is a heretic, an individual who smokes, drinks, loves carnal knowledge and seeks nothing more but the dissolution of the One State. The next thing you know D-503 finds himself on the side of revolution. As the book reaches it climactic moments questions as to the failure or success of the revolution are answered.

WE was a fascinating book to read. Some of the language is a bit dated and Zamyatin's 1921 idea of what the future might look like has been outstripped by the reality the 20th and 21st-centuries. However, the underlying themes of conformity v. freedom and "the state" v the individual still have great contemporary significance that keeps WE as fresh as it was when originally written.

Some have said that WE represented Zamyatin's attack on the oppression of the Soviet system. I would have to disagree. The book was written in 1920 well before the Soviet regime consolidated enough power to be considered a totalitarian society. Further, even though WE contains some reference to the damage caused by regimes such as the fledgling USSR it also contains references (looking back from the 26th-century) to societal ills caused by both capitalism and organized religion. As such, Zamyatin believed in equal opportunity when it came to instruments of oppression.

At the end of the day it seems that what Zamyatin valued most in society were those people willing to play the role of heretic. It certainly was a trait he valued in artists. As he noted in an essay written in 1919:

True literature can exist only where it is created, not by diligent and trustworthy functionaries, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels, and skeptics.

Zamyatin was a heretic, a dreamer, and a rebel. WE is a worthy monument to a person who believed that the individual was more important than the state without regard to whether that state had `all life's answers'. WE should be enjoyed by anyone who has read and liked H.G. Wells (who influenced Zamyatin), Huxley, or Orwell. This is a book worth reading. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CBARGRVMLEV6/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081297462X&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books#wasThisHelpful[Lonya]

*****
Roger Zelazny is a fascinating, singularly unique writer. What other author gives you the likes of Jack the Ripper, Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and Sherlock Holmes in the same novel? How about Lovecraftian themes and allusions? And it's not even a horror novel. This is wildly romping fantasy at its best. Our narrator is a dog named Snuff; he's no ordinary dog, however. He is the companion of Saucy Jack, the watchdog of unfathomable trapped monsters, calculator of the lines of fate, and immensely important guardian against evil. In certain years, when the moon is right, on All Hallow's Eve, the Elder Gods seek entry back into our world. At those times, the proper individuals and agents instinctively come to the crucial area and seek to either open or close the eldritch gates. During such a lonesome October, these agents prepare their spells and minds for the challenge, while interacting with one another in attempts to learn from, thwart, and sometimes remove their fellow players from the Game. Each player has a companion animal, and it is Snuff's interaction with his cohorts that drives the story along. Snuff's greatest friend is the cat Graymalk, and their relationship and true friendship in the face of possible competition really won me over. The Game is confusing early on, which is at it should be. The reader must struggle to understand not only what the Game actually is but also figure out who and what is on which side of the coming conflict. I remained relatively clueless as to how the final drama would play out, and I am happy to say I did not find it disappointing.

It is interesting to consider the players in this Game. While we know Snuff serves Jack the Ripper, we see the man as a cheerful, utterly pleasant man with a grave responsibility, a veritable hero in fact; allusions are made to his trips to town for certain necessary items, and we do see him become deadly dangerous when Snuff is in danger, but largely the character is Jack and never the Ripper. The other characters are basically all portrayed in the same fashion, and it becomes particularly amusing for the Great Detective to continue running around in the guise of a woman, especially since Snuff is never fooled by the disguise the way the humans are.

Zelazny gives us a fun read with this novel. It's not particularly funny, yet I view it as a comedy in many ways. There is one section when the text changes completely, describing a transit among the lands Lovecraft fans regard with awe and wonder, but by and large it is a fast, engrossing read sure to delight all fans of well-crafted, lively fantasy. There is only one Roger Zelazny, and no fan of fantasy should deprive himself of the talents of this fantastic author. I should also mention the fact that this book is replete with illustrations by the renowned Gahan Wilson; the illustrations strike me as minimalist and simplistic, but they do seem to suit the story and its style of presentation quite well, adding a further touch of distinction to this uncommonly good novel. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDGON6OBP8GY/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1556525605&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Daniel Jolley]

This is the famous lampooning of how life was in the Soviet Union, with veiled and caricatured personae of Stalin, Khrushchev, Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak and many more from the time period. One of the Soviet Union's leading philosophers, Alexander Zinoviev was, upon Brezhnev's personal orders, stripped of all degrees and honors, dismissed from his appointments, expelled from the Communist Party and deprived of citizenship for writing this book. This novel has been described as the one of the bitterest satirical attacks on the Soviet system to appear in Russian (and most probably in English as well). The book can be read on a number of different levels. Comparable to Swift, Kafka, Rabelais and Orwell. And quite readable, despite its length. Go for it. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2YGPETV2XEI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0370300394&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Vitaly Shukin]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674028422/[Amazon]

*****
Solomon and Marcolf is known for being both important and mysterious. It pits wise Solomon, famous from the Bible, against a wily peasant named Marcolf. One of its two parts is a dialogue, in which the king and jester, sage and fool, prophet and blasphemer bandy back and forth questions and comments. Whereas Solomon is solemn and pompous, Marcolf resorts to low language and earthy topics. The other part comprises twenty short chapters in which Marcolf tricks Solomon time and again. These episodes are as impudent and scatological as is the dialogue. Together, the two parts constitute a rudimental prose novel or “rogue biography.”

Cited by Bakhtin in Rabelais and His World, Solomon and Marcolf is widely known by name. But until now it has not been translated into any modern language. The present volume offers an introduction, followed by the Latin and English, detailed commentary, and reproductions of woodcut illustrations from the 1514 edition. Appendixes help readers understand the origins and influence of a work that was composed around 1200, that attained its greatest popularity in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that has the potential still today to delight and instruct. - http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674028422/[Amazon boilerplate]

[[Hidden_Camera]]
*Hidden Camera* (2005)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Camera-Eastern-European-Literature/dp/1564784126/[Amazon]

*****
In Zoran Zivkovic's recent novel, "Hidden Camera," a neurotic undertaker returns home one evening to find that a movie ticket has been left anonymously for him at his front door. He goes to the theater at the Film Archive--now almost deserted because it is a Monday evening--as instructed and finds that the film will be shown only to him and a mysterious woman. The film turns out to be an amateur video in which the undertaker himself was secretly filmed while sitting on a park bench. After the brief showing, the lights come up, and the woman has disappeared, leaving only a ticket for another event that the undertaker is meant to attend later that evening at a used bookstore. So begins an eerie scavenger hunt tailored solely to the undertaker, who then races around his city at night to increasingly unlikely locations where he is presented with one bizarre spectacle after another.

Zivkovic, a Serbian novelist, experiments with science fiction, existentialism, and metafiction and is often compared, appropriately, with Borges and Calvino. And "Hidden Camera" is a wonderful showcase for Zivkovic's talents. Nearly no twist or turn of this labyrinth can be foreseen, and the narrative provides a true edge-of-your-seat experience. Up till the very last page, I worried that Zivkovic wouldn't be able to pull off a real ending, and yet he did. Of course, that ending requires some work on the reader's part. It's fairly abstract, requires interpretation, and assumes that you've been paying close attention to the themes, symbols, and subtext. Even then, the book is a little like a riddle with a dozen possible answers, all of which (even cumulatively) fall just shy of a comprehensive solution. Still I found the climax tremendously rewarding. And Zivkovic gives you so much to remember and reflect on: harrowing suspense, indelible images, and scenes and settings that just keep getting more and more haunting and uncanny.

Of course, this is not a book for everyone. But you're a good candidate for Zivkovic's existentialist scalpel if you've survived, with no serious side effects, Charlie Kaufman's films or any of Kafka's novels. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R35O0NHZVHFY0Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564784126&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[A.

[[The_Library]]
*The Library* (2010)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*****
http://www.amazon.com/The-Library-Zoran-Zivkovic/dp/4902075334/[Amazon]
I've gone from a dabbler in SF (2006), to a reader in SF (2007), to a blogger in SF (2010), to a borderline archivist (2014). I don't shelve and archive everything, but I like to think I have a good ear/eye/nose for knowing which books to keep shelved... just in case, you know? However, this has not been proven to be the case; I still wish I had Brian Aldiss & Harry Harrison's anthology Farewell, Fantastic Venus (1968) and Theodore Sturgeon's collection Starshine (1966).

Zoran Živković is often compared to Jorge Luis Borges for his use of magical realism, in which surreal circumstances penetrate an otherwise urbane reality in which the unwitting victim-cum-protagonist (the same man or a series of different man with the same obsession) plods along in his life while dealing with these seemingly bizarre occurrences; however, this man (or these men) applies their everyday logic to deal with the outré events, yet doesn't skip a beat. The result: a man flummoxed by the phantasmagoric.

Through each story, the reader witness a man brought into subtle conflict with the bizarre, the uncanny, the unthinkable, the imponderable. The reader, as a third-person perspective witness of the events, understand the surreal aspects of each story, but the man always takes these matters in stride, applying a cold logic to the illogical with varying results.

“Virtual Library” enters the modernized world where an author sees his entire life's work before him even though he's not yet dead. Some stories like “Home Library” and “Smallest Library” could very well have been written by Kafka though in different pose and on a more upbeat note. Yet throughout the collection of stories here, there's a keen sense of humor, albeit the narrator's offered humor rather than the conscious humor of the victim-cum-protagonist. This humor culminates in “Noble Library” where the man desires to rid his library of an ever returning paperback novel—hilarity ensues yet the man is stalwart in ridding himself of the literary abomination. Regardless, each story garners smiles of relevance in a fellow book lover. They're delightful! - http://www.amazon.com/review/RMR19K6KLD1V9/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4902075334&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[2theD]

*****
If you read this book - and please do read it! - don't be fooled by Professor Zivkovic's simple, casual style. It is a really easy read. But - if you finish the book with a lot of questions or any questions - re-read the last chapter or two - I did. When I really understood the ending my brain practically exploded. There is so much misdirection and so many metaphors that one might think the book doesn't really resolve to something easily understandable.

After re-reading the last chapter and understanding the ending I couldn't stop thinking about the ending. I've never read a book where I spent hours thinking about what I had just read. The more I thought about it - the more I realized that this seemingly lightweight book was in fact an incredible psychological thriller. Had I not re-read the last chapter I would have missed the whole point - and that point is pure amazement. Amazement at the creative brain of this incredible Serbian author.

BTW - I found the book in a Washington Post review. The reviewer clearly got the book and it's fantastic ending and suggested that it should be considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Gets my vote too. - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DV3YU6EHST84[Amazon Customer]

*****
Pamela Zoline's titular "Heat Death" from this collection is often correctly billed as the best short story of the British New Wave movement of the late 60s/early 70s. Postmodern in style, feminist in message, and providing a fascinating blend of hard and soft sf, it deserves to be read more. But don't buy this collection for just "Heat Death" - there are other gems here as well. Although not sf, "The Holland of the Mind" is another pomo masterpiece; "Sheep" is brilliant as well; in fact all of the stories have something to offer. If you like stylistically challenging reading that crosses genre boundaries, this is the collection for you. If only Zoline wrote more! - http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0GX4S58EFIV/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0914232894&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Krista K]

*****
Not since Gogol have I found such a bizarre, zany narrative, and such a peculiar narrator! Here Zoshchenko's narrator takes us through vignettes of everyday Soviet life, mostly of the NEP period, praising everything and making a fool of himself at the same time. The intense humanity of his characters come through, even (especially) when they're rioting in their collective kitchen over a coveted kitchen utensil. Very nice reading and re-reading for years to come. - http://www.amazon.com/review/R29C8VSN45SMCG/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0253201926&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books[Adrienne Shirley]
