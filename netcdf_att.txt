Comparison of GRIIDC Requirements to ACDD/NODC Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------

Here is a comparison between the information required by the ISO-19115-2 editor at:

https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/metadata-editor/[+https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/metadata-editor/+]

and both the ACDD 1-3 recommended attributes at:

http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3[+http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3+]

and an NODC template at:

http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/data/formats/netcdf/v1.1/point.cdl[+http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/data/formats/netcdf/v1.1/point.cdl+]

The NODC comparison column is omitted when it is identical to the ACDD comparison column.

The sections below correspond to the seven sections on the GOMRI page.

Dataset Contact
---------------

This section collects contact information about the person primarily responsible for the creation and maintenance of the dataset. Provides future researchers the means to contact the dataset originator if additional information is needed. 

*Note:*  The +role+ is a pulldown list containing +Resource Provider+, +Custodian+, +Owner+, +Distributer+, +Originator+, +Point of
Contact+, +Principle Investigator+, +Processor+, +Publisher+ and +Author+ as choices.

Dataset Information
-------------------

This section collects identifying and amplifying information about the dataset. Provides future researchers with specific details on the dataset content and additional context regarding the broader purpose of the dataset.

*Note:*  The +supplementalInformation+ variable contains the concatenated entries to six separate GUI boxes:  data parameters and
units, methods, instruments, sampling scales and rates, error analysis, and provenance and historical references.

Keywords
--------

This section collects keywords/key phrases describing the theme and location of the dataset. Provides GRIIDC and future researchers with short descriptions to aid search. Some datasets may not have relevant place keywords (ex. lab simulations).

Data Extent
-----------

This section collects information describing the spatial and temporal extent of the dataset contents. Provides GRIIDC and future researchers the means to search for datasets by location and/or time. Some datasets may not have relevant a location or time (ex. lab simulations); a short explanation is provided in these cases.

*Note*: The geographic extent in GRIIDC is stored in a GML +Polygon+ element.  The geographic extent in ACDD by ten separate
+geospatial_*+ attributes, and in the NODC guidelines by thirteen separate +geospatial+*+ attributes.  According to the ACDD
web page, there is a mapping between its recommendations and ISO 19115-2 detailed at:
