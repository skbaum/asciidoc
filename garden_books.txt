*****
"In The Language of Fruit, Liz Bellamy explores how poets, playwrights, and novelists from the Restoration to the Romantic era represented fruit and fruit trees in a period that saw significant changes in cultivation techniques, the expansion of the range of available fruit varieties, and the transformation of the mechanisms for their exchange and distribution. Although her principal concern is with the representation of fruit within literary texts and genres, she nevertheless grounds her analysis in the consideration of what actually happened in the gardens and orchards of the past."

*****
Locate the dry-farm in a section with an annual precipitation of more than ten
inches and, if possible, with small wind movement. One man with four horses
and plenty of machinery cannot handle more than from 160 to 200 acres. Farm
fewer acres and farm them better.

Select a clay loam soil. Other soils may be equally productive, but are
cultivated properly with somewhat more difficulty.#

Make sure, with the help of the soil auger, that the soil is of uniform
structure to a depth of at least eight feet. If streaks of loose gravel or
layers of hardpan are near the surface, water may be lost to the plant roots.

After the land has been cleared and broken let it lie fallow with clean
cultivation, for one year. The increase in the first and later crops will pay
for the waiting.

Always plow the land early in the fall, unless abundant experience shows that
fall plowing is an unwise practice in the locality. Always plow deeply unless
the subsoil is infertile, in which case plow a little deeper each year until
eight or ten inches are reached. Plow at least once for each crop. Spring
plowing, if practiced, should be done as early as possible in the season.

Follow the plow, whether in the fall or spring, with the disk and that with
the smoothing harrow, if crops are to be sown soon afterward. If the land
plowed in the fall is to lie fallow for the winter, leave it in the rough
condition, except in localities where there is little or no snow and the
winter temperature is high.

Always disk the land in early spring, to prevent evaporation. Follow the disk
with the harrow. Harrow, or in some other way stir the surface of the soil
after every rain. If crops are on the land, harrow as long as the plants will
stand it. If hoed crops, like corn or potatoes, are grown, use the cultivator
throughout the season. A deep mulch or dry soil should cover the land as far
as possible throughout the summer. Immediately after harvest disk the soil
thoroughly.

Destroy weeds as soon as they show themselves. A weedy dry-farm is doomed to
failure.

Give the land an occasional rest, that is, a clean summer fallow. Under a
rainfall of less than fifteen inches, the land should be summer fallowed every
other year; under an annual rainfall of fifteen to twenty inches, the summer
fallow should occur every third or fourth year. Where the rainfall comes
chiefly in the summer, the summer fallow is less important in ordinary years
than where the summers are dry and the winters wet. Only an absolutely clean
fallow should be permitted.

The fertility of dry-farm soils must be maintained. Return the manure; plow
under green leguminous crops occasionally and practice rotation. On fertile
soils plants mature with the least water.

Sow only by the drill method. Wherever possible use fall varieties of crops.
Plant deeply — three or four inches for grain. Plant early in the fall,
especially if the land has been summer fallowed. Use only about one half as
much seed as is recommended for humid-farming.

All the ordinary crops may be grown by dry-farming. Secure seed that has been
raised on dry-farms. Look out for new varieties, especially adapted for
dry-farming, that may be brought in. Wheat is king in dry-farming; corn a
close second. Turkey wheat promises the best.

Stock the dry-farm with the best modern machinery. Dry-farming is possible
only because of the modern plow, the disk, the drill seeder, the harvester,
the header, and the thresher.

Make a home on the dry-farm. Store the flood waters in a reservoir, or pump
the underground waters, for irrigating the family garden. Set out trees, plant
flowers, and keep some live stock.

Learn to understand the reasons back of the principles of dry-farming, apply
the knowledge vigorously, and the crop cannot fail.

Always farm as if a year of drouth were coming.

*****
A 1939 reprint of the 1652 first edition.

*Foreword*

"The Gardeners Labyrinth" is a book to be read leisurely in springtime and again as the blasts of winter rock the house and all is snug within. The author, "D.M." is known to be Thomas Hyll and those initials stand for a play upon his name-Dydymus Mountaine-a type of humor carried on by Parkinson in call-ing his own first book "Paradisi in Sole". Hyll was a Londoner "rudely taught" as he himself says and his book is for "the simple and unlettered".

Hyll has the further distinction of writing perhaps the earliest gardening book published in England, "A Most Briefe and pleasaunt treatyse" 1563, a rare work of testament size called, in editions of 1568 and thereafter, by the title "Profittable Arte of Gardening". True, it had been preceded by books of husbandry and medicine in which the garden was discussed and, notably, by Tusser's first book in verse, "One hundred pointes" 1557, of which but one copy now is known to exist.

"The Gardeners Labyrinth" was first printed in 1577, after Hyll's death, in "black letter" and in succeeding editions the cuts of his books seem to have been interchanged, but this edition of 1652, the last to appear and itself rare, was set in such nearly modern type font as to permit facsimile reproduction. It contains the famous woodcuts illustrative of Tudor gardens, the costumes and the tools of the period. It has the plans for mazes and for knots (pp. 25-26), the repeated picture of the "herber", though reversed from the first edition, the use (p. 53) of the "great Squirts" for watering the garden by troughs and (p. 54) the jaunty and pleasant pair of garden workers.

The text itself is unique in its accuracy of detail for the garden maker and should be required reading for us all. It was Hyll's statements, repeated in Chap. XX and Chap. XXI, which so aroused the scorn of Fulke that he wrote a book of refutation, the only early writer to dispute the influence of the heavenly bodies upon the plants, and to this day echoes of that discussion are found in every gardening journal.

As "The Art of Simpling" is the most readable of all the Old Herbals so, without question, "The Gardeners Labyrinth" is the most informative and enjoyable of the rare gardening books written in English. The Second Part of this work, with separate title page and usually bound with the book here reproduced, is of far less general interest and charm, listing and discussing the "physick vertues, benefits and helps" of leeks and chives, "onyons", mustard, strawberries, purselane, rocket, "lettice", endive, "succorie", "artechoke" and a hundred others, much in the fashion of the Herbals.

The untaught Hyll lived and wrote at the same time as Thos. Tusser, William Turner, Sir Hugh Plat, John Gerard, and Wm. Lawson and yet his stature suffers none by comparison in the perspective of three hundred and fifty years.

*The Fig* (1902, 15) - Robert Henderson Price

*****
"Very little has been done in Texas along the line of commercial fig cultivation. Throughout the extreme South, fig trees are grown to a considerable extent, but usually as yard or lawn trees, and seldom any attention is paid even to the cultivation of these. The fig is a fruit that is not as commonly found as it should be, especially in the rural districts, where fruits for the table are not common, and the dessert list of the housewife's menu is limited. It is easily grown where it is adapted, yields abundantly, and is a very healthful article of diet; being laxative in its effect, it is especially wholesome in the warm Southern States, and is recommended as an article of diet by physicians."

Problems

Insect Pests
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Squash, Leaf-Footed and Stink Bugs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I asked the knowledgeable folks on the
https://www.facebook.com/groups/TexasGardening/[Texas Gardening] Facebook
group what to do about this unholy trinity that are my single biggest
gardening
problem.
I started by mentioning that I'd already tried:

* putting boards down around the plants at night, picking them up in
the morning, and squishing the bugs to be found there;
* putting diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants;
* using a portable vacuum to suck them off the plants; and
* squishing them by hand, a most unpleasant task given how the stink
bugs have very much earned their name.

Here are some of the
replies.
There's certainly not a single answer to this pernicious and growing problem.
I'm going to try every last one of them until all
those pernicious little demons are extinct.

"A shopvac is about the best you are going to get unless you use some high
dose poison."

"Companion planting. I had basil and dill around mine last year and only saw a
few when it got really hot late summer."

"Last year, I had them bad! I sprayed them and the eggs liberally with this
stuff (http://www.gardenvarietyorganics.com/products/natures-guide-garlic-pepper-tea-qt[Nature's Guide Garlic Pepper Tea]) and they were gone the next day. Never came back. I don't know if there
is a homemade recipe that might work as good."

[Recipes for a homemade version of this can be found at

Tea Recipe],

"My grandmother swears by seven. She brushes the pods with it when planting and
then when seedling. Also she checks daily and kills any at first sign. She's
never had a crop go bad or lost due to them."

"Attract skunks, or at least let them roam freely. Their presence has been the
best control ever. Every night, they strip every last squash bug off every
stem, without harming the plant or the squash."

"An old farmer told me to sprinkle wood ashes on the ground real thick and dust
the plants."

"I'd also add that wide spacing around each plant seems to help."

"I use jumping spiders, build spider houses-- they will come."

[I found this especially intriguing so I found a 
http://www.spiderroom.info/makeaspiderhouse.html[Make a Spider House] site.
Basically, you build structures that a spider would see and think "Hey, that's
a good place to build a web!"]

"Wrap the stalks with foil."

"Sprinkle plants with garlic powder pnd lant garlic around
the edges of planting beds. Bugs can't stand it. Old trick grandpa taught me."

"Use a tomato cage to support them. Wrap the stem with tin foil. Cover a
yellow Frisbee or cup with a thick coating of Vaseline and leave in garden as
a trap."

"Plus plant marigolds garlic borage dill and basil among your plants."

"Soapy water will help, too."

"ok one more thing I did last year that "helped" as I downed rubber gloves and
smashed them for sport and vengeance... I chucked their lifeless corpses in a
pail of water with the "oils"??? forming on top in a tea like slurry... I
poured this around my tomatoes plants...maybe the smell of death/fear??? It is
their defence when scared??? maybe just I killed THAT many but it seem to ward
off the juice sucking @#$%^& like garlic does vampires... kept the dogs and
cats away from the bed too..."

"Companion planting. Pyrethreum is a great start.. lavender or garlic all work
well."

"Compost tea and nicotine tea also work wonders. I make my own garlic pepper
tea that is amazing... but we have bees as well so selective application is
imperative."
