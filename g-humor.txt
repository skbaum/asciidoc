*****
After the lapse of about half a century since the issue of the last edition of
Dodsley's Select Collection of Old Plays,1 and the admittance of that work
into the honourable rank of scarce and dear books, it seemed a desirable thing
to attempt, with such additional improvements as might be practicable or
expedient, a revival of a publication which has been a favourite with the
lovers of our early drama since its first publication more than a hundred
years ago. Between 1744, the date of its original appearance, and 1825, it
passed through three editions; and it may be remarked that the tendency in
each successive edition has been to remodel the undertaking on the principle
of rejecting plays which from time to time have been lifted up (so to speak)
into the collected works of their respective authors, and to substitute for
them plays which have either suffered unmerited obscurity in original and rare
editions, or have lain so far scattered about in various other collections;
and in the present instance that principle has been strictly adherred to.

It is desirable that it should be seen precisely in what manner, and to what
extent, the edition now offered differs from its predecessors as regards the
contents. The points of variation are three: 1. Omissions; 2. Additions of
pieces not included in the former editions; 3. Additional plays now first
reprinted from the originals. The first division comprises the following
productions which, since the last republication of Dodsley, have been taken up
into the collected editions of their respective authors:—

...

The second and third characteristics of our book are the Additions, which, as
we have stated, are of two kinds. In the first place, we may enumerate the
dramas new to Dodsley's collection, though previously edited in a variety of
forms :—

...

The remaining feature, recommending the undertaking to indulgent notice, is
perhaps the most important and interesting. Subjoined is a list of the
dramatic compositions which have never hitherto appeared in any series of Old
English Plays, and of which the originals are of the utmost rarity :—

1) *The Tragi-Comedy of Calisto and Melibaoa* (1520) +
2) *Nice Wanton, An Interlude* (1560) +
3) *An Interlude, Called Like Will to Like* (1568) - Ulpian Fulwella +
4) *The History of Jacob and Esau* (1568) +
5) *The Marriage of Wit and Science* (1570) +

A strictly chronological arrangement has been adopted. Such a plan appeared to
be the most desirable and the most obvious, as it facilitates our appreciation
of the gradual and progressive development of dramatic composition. If it may
be thought to labour under any disadvantage, it is perhaps that it has the
effect of throwing into a single consecutive series, without discrimination,
pieces which are mere interludes, and others which are characterised by higher
qualities, and aspire to belong to the regular drama. But the evil will be
found not to be of a very serious kind, and it will disappear after the
earlier volumes of the collection.

In fixing the order of sequence, the place of a production in the series has
been occasionally determined by the date at which it is believed to have been
written or presented, rather than by the date at which it left the printer's
hands. Such is the case with Heywood's "Pardoner and Friar," and the anonymous
interlude of "New Custom ;" as well as with "Ealph Roister Doister," and
"Gammer Gurton's Needle," all of which may be taken to belong to a period some
time anterior to their publication.

A leading characteristic of the collection as now reconstructed is the. great
preponderance of pieces, of which the authors are not known, or by authors who
have not left more than one or two dramatic productions. It was judged
expedient, in the interest of purchasers, to give a preference to these single
or anonymous plays, as it will probably not be long before the works of every
voluminous writer are collected. Those of Jonson, Shirley, Peele, Greene,
Ford, Massinger, Middleton, and Chapman, have already been edited, and
Brome's, Decker's, Heywood's, and Glapthorne's will follow in due course. To
all these the new Dodsley will serve as a supplement and companion.

The editor felt himself in a position of somewhat special difficulty and
delicacy, when it became necessary to consider the question of retaining or
excluding the prefatory matter attached to the impressions of this work in
1744 and 1780. A careful and impartial perusal of that matter made it evident
that the prudent course, on the whole, was to reject these prolegomena. There
was no alternative but their entire preservation or their entire suppression;
for any arbitrary alterations or curtailments would have been liable to
objection or censure. In the first place, there was Dodsley's own preface,
chiefly occupied by a sketch of the history of our stage, but based on the
most imperfect information, and extremely unsatisfactory, if not misleading.
Then there was, like Pelion heaped on Ossa, Isaac Reed's introduction, more
elaborate and copious than Dodsley's, yet far from complete or systematic, and
not improved by the presence of an appendix or sequel. Reed, of course, went
over the same ground as Dodsley had already traversed with inferior ability
and less ample resources at his command, and there were repetitions, as might
be expected, of the same particulars. There seemed to be two forms of
weakness—redundancy on the one hand and meagreness on the other. Again, all
the information collected by Dodsley and Reed was to be found elsewhere, with
innumerable improvements and corrections of mistakes, the subject itself more
methodically handled, and the early annals of the English drama and theatre
almost presented to the public view under a new aspect, by Mr Collier, in his
well-known work printed in 1831, a publication heartily welcomed and
appreciated at the time of its appearance and long after, and even now a
literary monument, of which it may be said that, with whatever defects it may
possess, it reflects as much credit on its author as a far more perfect
performance brought to completion at the present day under more favourable
auspices could reflect on any one else. It was a long advance on anything
which had been attempted so far in the same direction; and to reproduce, in
the face of Mr Collier's volumes, the obsolete and superseded labours of
Dodsley and even Eeed, seemed to be a waste of space which might be far more
beneficially occupied by additional texts.

As regards the orthography, it has to be pointed out that, in consonance with
the system adopted by Dyce and others, it has been reduced to our modern
standard; but at the same time it should be understood that the language of
the writers has in every case been held sacred. Than the spelling which occurs
in early plays and tracts, more espedaily perhaps those of a popular
character, nothing can well be more capricious and uncouth; but the
phraseology and terms are on all accounts of value. Not a word, therefore, nor
even part of a word, has suffered alteration; and wherever there was a doubt,
as there might be in preparing for the press once more such an extensive
collection of pieces, it was thought better to err on the side of caution.
Weever, the author of "Funeral Monuments," retained with scrupulous exactitude
the ancient spelling ipsissimis verbis; and such a plan might be advisable and
convenient with sepulchral inscriptions or records; but in the matter before
us what an editor had principally, if not almost exclusively, to consider, was
the preservation in their fullest integrity of the language of the time and
the sense of the playwright.

The first and second editions of Dodsley's collection appear, notwithstanding
what is asserted to the contrary in Reed's preface, to have been superintended
with no very high degree of care, and the late Mr Dyce, indeed, used to
observe that the same criticism was applicable to the edition of 1825. But the
latter, with the fullest admission of its defects, is certainly marked by
great improvements on its predecessors in more than one way. The labours of
Hawkins1 and Dilke 2 reflect considerable honour upon those gentlemen.

It is almost superfluous to observe that the preceding editions, the last and
best not excepted, present a very large number of statements, opinions, and
readings, which more recent and more exact information has shown to be
erroneous. All these
mistakes have been carefully rectified, wherever the knowledge and experience
of the editor enabled him to detect them.

A certain number of corruptions and obscurities remain, which it passed the
editor's ingenuity to eradicate or clear away. The printed remains of our
early drama have come down to us, for the most part, in a sadly mutilated
state, and the attempt to amend and restore the text to its original purity
will, it may be safely affirmed, never succeed more than to a very imperfect
extent. Even the late Mr Dyce's revised edition of Shakespeare, 18G8, abounds
with misprints and other distortions of the writer's sense; and we must
abandon in some cases the hope of ever arriving at the true readings. So it is
with the miscellaneous assemblage of dramatic productions here brought
together. A great deal has been done by a succession of editors to reducje the
errors of the printer or copyist to a minimum; but, after all, there are
places where it would require the assistance of the Sphinx to supply a chasm,
or rectify a palpable mistake.

The work, in its present state, should assuredly have some degree of interest
and worth; for it offers in one collected body the best specimens of dramatic
literature which the English language
affords, castigated and enriched by some of our best commentators and critics.

In these volumes, as now rearranged, it is trusted that very few uncollected
plays of real importance will be found wanting; but as an enterprise of this
kind can never amount to more than a selection, as it purports to be, it
appeared judicious, in making the choice, to give the preference to such
pieces as either illustrated the manners of the period, or marked the gradual
development of the dramatic art.

The only basis on which the present editor can rest, so far as he is aware,
the slightest claim to credit is the attention which he has bestowed on the
rearrangement of the collection as it now stands; the conscientious and
vigilant supervision of the whole matter here brought together—prefaces,
texts, and notes—and the correction of errors on the part of his predecessors,
occasioned by a variety of causes. In carrying out even this unambitious
programme, there was a fair share of labour and difficulty, and, of course, it
has involved the addition of a new crop of notes scattered up and down the
series, as well as the occasional displacement of certain illustrative remarks
founded on wrong data.

*****
*Introduction*

Although these Chap-books are very curious, and on many accounts interesting,
no attempt has yet been made to place them before the public in a collected
form, accompanied by the characteristic engravings, without which they would
lose much of their value. They are the relics of a happily past age, one which
can never return, and we, in this our day of cheap, plentiful, and good
literature, can hardly conceive a time when in the major part of this country,
and to the larger portion of its population, these little Chap-books were
nearly the only mental pabulum offered . Away from the towns, newspapers were
rare indeed, and not worth much when obtainable—poor little flimsy sheets such
as nowadays we should not dream of either reading or publishing, with very
little news in them, and that consisting principally of war items, and foreign
news, whilst' these latter books were carried in the packs of the pedlars, or
Chapmen, to every village, and to every home.

Previous to the eighteenth century, these men generally carried ballads, as is
so well exemplified in the "Winter's Tale," in Shakespeare's inimitable
conception, Autolycus. The servant (Act iv. sc 3) well describes his stock:
"He hath songs, for man, or woman, of all sizes; no milliner can so fit his
customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love songs for maids; so without
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of 'dildos' and
'fadings:'
'jump her' and 'thump her;" and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, as
it were, mean mischief, and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the
maid to answer, 'Whoop, do me no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him,
with 'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'" And Autolycus, himself, hardly
exaggerate! the style of his wares, judging by those which have come dowq to
us, when he praises the ballads: "How a usurer's wife was brought to bed of
twenty money-bags at a burden; and howl she longed to eat adders' heads, and
toads carbonadoed;" and "of a fish, that appeared upon the coast, on Wednesday
the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids;" for the wonders of both ballads, and
early Chap-books, are manifold, and bear strange testimony to the ignorance,
and credulity, of their purchasers. These ballads and Chap-books have, luckily
for us, been preserved by collectors, and although they are scarce, are
accessible to readers in that national blessing, the British Museum. There the
Roxburghe, Luttrell, Bagford, and other collections of black-letter ballads
are easily obtainable for purposes of study, and, although the Chap-books, to
the uninitiated (owing to the difficulties of the Catalogue), are not quite so
easy of access, yet there they exist, and are a splendid series—it is
impossible to say a complete one, because some are unique, and are in private
hands, but so large, especially from the middle to the close of the last
century, as to be virtually so.

*Preface*

We have no means of knowing the history of Master "Ebenezer Cook, Gentleman,"
who, one hundred and forty-six years ago, produced the 'Sot-Weed Factor's
Voyage to Maryland.'  He wrote, printed, published, and sold it in London for
sixpence sterling, and then disappeared forever.  We do not know certainly
that Mr. Cook himself was the actual adventurer who suffered the ills
described by him "in burlesque verse."  Indeed, "Eben: Cook, Gent." may be a
myth--a nom de plume.  Yet, there is a certain personal poignancy and
earnestness about the whole Story that almost forbid the idea of a second-hand
narrative.  Nay, I think it extremely probable that it was "Eben: Cook,
Gent." or, some other equally afflicted gentleman assuming that name, who--

'Condemned by Fate to wayward Curse, +
Of Friends unkind and empty purse,--' +

fled from his native land to become a Sot-Weed factor in America.

The adventures and manners described are ludicrous and certainly very
unpolished.  Although Mr. Cook calls his poem "A Satyr," there is, in his
account of early habits in Maryland, so much resemblance to what we observe in
the rude society of all new settlements, that it is possible the story is not
so much a Satire as a hightened description of what an unlucky traveler found
in certain quarters of the colony, Anno Domini, 1700.  When "Mr. Cook," with
an anathema in his mouth, makes a final bow to his readers, he expressly adds,
in a note, on the last page, that "the Author does not intend by this any of
the English Gentlemen resident there;" still, excepting even all these select
personages, he doubtless found un-gentlefolk enough among the rough farmers
and fishermen of obscure "Piscato-way" and the adjacent country, to justify
his discontent.  At all events, we may, I imagine, very reasonably supposed
"Eben: Cook" to have been a London "Gent:" rather decayed by fast living, sent
abroad to see the world and be tamed by it, who very soon discovered that Lord
Baltimore's Colony was not the court of her Majesty Queen Anne, or its taverns
frequented by Addison and the wits; and whose disgust became supreme when he
was "finished" on the "Eastern-Shoar" by

'A pious, Concientious Rogue' +

who, taking advantage of his incapacity for trade, cheated him out of his
cargo and sent him home without a leaf of the coveted "Sot-weed!"  This poem
is, very likely, the result of that homeward voyage.  With proper allowance
for breadth and burlesque, angry exaggeration and the discomforts of such a
"Gentleman" as we may fancy Master Cook to have been, it is well worth
preservation as hinting, if not photographing, the manners and customs of the
ruder classes in a British Province a century and a half ago.

*****
The English were not slow in following the example which had been set them by
Scarron, and other French writers. In 1664 and 1678 Charles Cotton published
his 'Scarronides, or Virgil Travestie, a Mock Poem on the First and Fourth
Books of Virgil's JEneid, in English Burlesque.' This work is not, as the
title seems to imply, a translation from Scarron. It is not inferior to the
French production, and was so excellent of its kind, and so popular, that
twelve editions were printed before the middle of the 18th century. Cotton's
'Scarronides' was followed by several other works of a similar description, of
which I can give only the titles and the dates. 'Cataplus, or AEneas, his
descent to Hell, a Mock Poem, in imitation of the Sixth Book of Virgil's
AEneis, in English Burlesque, 1671.'—'Maronides, or Virgil Travestie, being a
new Paraphrase on the Fifth Book of Virgil's AEneids, in Burlesque Verse, by
John Philips, 1672. The Sixth Book, by the same, 1673.'—'Scarronides, or
Virgil Travestie, a Mock Poem, on the Second Book of Virgil's AEneis, in
English Burlesque, by John Smith, 1691.'

*****
Pope's chief contemporary in formal satire in verse was Young, whose 'Love of
Fame, The Universal Passion' was finished in 1727, before the publication of
the 'Dunciad'. The seven satires which this work contains comprise portrayals of
type characters under Latin names, diversified by allusions to living
personages, the intention being to ridicule evils in contemporary social life.
'The Epistles to Pope' (1730), by the same author, are more serious, especially
in their arraignment of Grub Street. Young's comparatively lifeless work made
seemingly no strong appeal to Byron. The latter never mentions him as a
satirist, although he does quote with approval some favorite passages from his
work.

*The Publisher to the Reader*

The Author of the Cantos had no other Motive for the offering you the History
of the Reformation in a Burlesque Stile; (tho' an History full of melancholly
Incidents, which have distracted the Nation, even beyond the Hope of Recovery,
after so much Blood drawn from all its Veins, and from its Head) but that
which be met with in Sir Roger L'Estrange's 'Preface' to the Second Part of
his 'Cit and Bumpkin', express'd in these Words: Tho' this Way of fooling is
not my Talent, nor Inclination; yet I have great Authorities for the taking up
of this Humour, in regard not only of the Subject, but of the Age we live in,
which runs so much upon the Droll, that hardly any Thing else will down with
it.

Booksellers almost invariably catalogue this as "a work full of humour, but
which often transgresses the bounds of decency," a stolen phrase which very
inadequately describes its coarseness. The first volume of this translation
appeared in 1762 with the facetious title "A New Translation of Homer's Iliad,
adapted to the capacity of Honest English Roast Beef and Pudding Eaters, by
Caustic Barebones, a broken apothecary." -

*Preface*

Good people, would you know the reason +
I write at this unlucky season, +
When all the nation is so poor +
That few can keep above one whore, +
Except the lawyers--(whose large fees +
Maintain as many as they please)-- +
And Pope, with taste and judgement great, +
Has deign'd this author to translate-- +
Thie reason's this:-- He may not please +
The jocund tribe so well as these; +
For all capacities can't climb +
To comprehend the true sublime. +
Another reason I can tell, +
Though silence might do full as well; +
But being charg'd--discharge I must, +
For bladder, if too full, will burst. +
The writers of the merry class, +
E'er since the time of Hudibras, +
In this strange blunder all agree, +
To murder short-legg'd poetry. +
Words, though design'd to make ye smile, +
Why mayn't they run as smooth as oil? +
No poetaster can convince +
A many of any kind of sense, +
That verse can be the greater treasure, +
Or can persuade, that false rough metre, +
Than true and smooth, by far is sweeter. +
This is the wherefore; and the why, +
Have patience, you'll see by-and-by. +

broad in the basis, and was designed to give the spectator
instruction in architecture, sculpture and astronomy.

'The Rolliad', or more correctly, 'Criticisms on the Rolliad,' for
the poem itself (except in some disjointed extracts introduced
as examples) existed only in the fertile brains of the
authors of this satire on Mr. Rolle (afterwards Lord
Rolle), who was elected M.P. for Devon in 1784, in the
Tory interest.  When 'The Rolliad' first appeared it had
great success, and rapidly ran through many editions,
but time has cast into oblivion most of its
allusions, and the characters introduced are well
nigh forgotten.  'The Rolliad' was written by several
authors, and parts have been ascribed to George
Ellis, General Fitzpatrick, and Joseph Richardson
M.P.  Lord Rolle died in 1842.

*****
'The Lousiad,' an Heroi-Comic Poem, in five cantos.  By
Peter Pindar, Esq. (Dr. John Wolcott.) The introduction
to this satire runs as follows: "It is necessary to inform
thee, Gentle Reader, that His Majesty (George III.) actually
discovered, some time ago, as he sat at table, a louse on
his plate.  An edict was, in consequence, passed for
shaving the cooks, scullions, etc., and the unfortunate
louse was condemned to die.

Such is the foundation of 'The Lousiad,' of which the
ingenious author, who ought to be allowed to know somewhat
of the matter, hath been heard privately to declare,
that, in his opinion, the 'Batrachomyomachis' of Homer, the
'Succhia Rapita' of Tassoni, the 'Lutrin' of Boileau, the
'Dispensary' of Garth, and the 'Rape of the Lock' of Pope, are
not to be compared to it.

The louse I sing, who, from some head unknown, +
Yet born and educated near a throne, +
Dropped down--(so willed the dread decree of fate!) +
With legs wide sprawling on the monarch's plate: +
Far from the raptures of a wife's embrace, +
Far from the gambols of a tender race, +
Whose little feet he taught with care to tread +
Amidst the wide dominions of the head; +
Led them to daily food with fond delight, +
And taught the tiny wanderers where to bite; +
To hide, to run, advance, or turn their tails, +
When hostile combs attacked, or vengeful nails: +
Far from those pleasing scenes ordained to roam, +
Like wise Ulysses, from his native home; +
Yet like that sage, though forced to roam and mourn, +
Like him, alas, noted fated to return! +
Who, full of rags and glory, saw his boy +
And wife again, and dog that died for joy. +
Down dropped the luckless louse with fear appalled, +
And wept his wife and children as he sprawled. +

*****
When Wickedness, no longer kept at bay, +
Sweeps thro' the island with resistless sway; +
When, to be good and lead a life upright, +
You must turn hermit and avoid the sight; +
When those, who only would be good in shew, +
Are shunn'd as much as those who're 'really' so; +
When scarce a family from th' infection's free, +
(Unless we except the Royal Family!) +
What pow'r can urge me thus to draw my quill? +
Or having drawn, can urge to to sit still? +

*****
With a frontispiece by George Cruikshank.  This anonymous work, written in
imitation of the first satire of Persius, was devoted to the
ridicule of the minor poets of the day, most of whom are now
entirely forgotten:--

What can provoke thy muse? scarce thrice a year +
Matilda's woeful madrigals appear; +
Lewis no more the tender maid affrights +
With incantations, ravishments, and sprites; +
Crusca (to Gifford thanks!) is fairly fled, +
And Cottle's epices sleep among the dead; +
E'en Walcot's impious blasphemies are o'er, +
And Andrews' Prologues are the vogue no more. +

Alluding to Rosa Matilda's effusions; M. G. Lewis,
author of 'The Monk;' Gifford's attack on the Della
Cruscans; Amos Cottle's poems, and the satirical
works of Dr. John Wolcot, known as Peter Pindar.

*Chapter 1*

Previous to my departure for the western Paradise of Liberty, my impressions
with regard to the country were, upon the whole, rather of a favourable
character. It is true, I did not believe a word of the inflated accounts given
by certain French revolutionary travellers, such as Brissot, Chastellux, and
others; much less in those of Birkbeck, Miss Wright, Captain Hall, and the
rest of the radical fry. I was too conversant with the Quarterly Review, to be
led astray by these Utopian romancers, and felt pretty well satisfied that the
institutions of the country were altogether barbarous. I also fully believed
that the people were a bundling, gouging, drinking, spitting, impious race,
without either morals, literature, religion, or refinement; and that the
turbulent spirit of democracy was altogether incompatible with any state of
society becoming a civilized nation. Being thus convinced that their situation
was, for the present, deplorable, and in the future entirely hopeless, unless
they presently relieved themselves from the cumbrous load of liberty under
which they groaned, I fell into a sort of compassion for them, such as we feel
for condemned criminals, having no hope of respite, and no claim to benefit of
clergy.

*****
Averse, on critical principles, to the union of
Tragedy and Comedy in the same Play, it had often occurred to me, in reading
Shakspeare, that the several scenes in the First and Second Parts of Henry the
Fourth, and Henry the Fifth, relative to Falstaff, might, separated from
the tragic and solemn ones, --slightly abridged for the sake of delicacy, and
in a very few instances newly arranged, in consequence of the necessary
omissions, produce a single Drama equal in point of wit, if not of plot--and
if well got up and acted with spirit, equal in amusement and effect on the
stage—even to the Merry Wives of Windsor. 

Under this impression, and taking advantage of a few days leisure, I have
accordingly attempted the arrangement.-—Falstaff’s Wit must delight wherever
found; but it is at least inconvenient to search for it, scattered as it is,
through the Scenes of three Plays.  The object (and the difficulty) was to collect it
into a more tangible shape. How it may affect others, I know not; I would
hope with pleasure; but to my own poor judgment, the result equals my
expectation.

If it be objected, that there is no regular plot, the answer is, that it is a
Narrative of “The Life, Opinions, and Humours of Falstaff,” nor is it, at
least, without its moral; since it shews, that vice and “imprudence, though
accompanied with wit, gaiety, and talent, will end only in disease, debt, and
disappointment. '

As the tragic and serious parts of the three plays have been omitted, I found,
on adjusting the acts as drawn from Henry the Fourth, that one campaign only
was necessary for the action; the recruiting scene at Justice Shallow’s,
therefore, appeared to come in with greater propriety and eject before
Falstaff’s march, with his ragged recruits to Coventry. For a similar reason,
and particularly as the scene lies in Eastcheap and London, it struck me, that
the character of Chief Justice in the Original Plays, would, as it now stands,
be better sustained by the Lord Mayor.

The Play thus condensed, either in description or
action, gives the whole Life and History of “Honest Jack Falstaff," and
perhaps a more perfect character was never drawn or produced on any stage,
antient or modern. - C. S.

*****
*Prefatory Observations*

The various lampoons on the Reverend David Williamson, the uxorious clergyman
who outstripped Henry VIII. in the number of his wives, having been excluded
from the published volume of Pasquils, are placed with a few similar
objectionable productions in the present brochure, of which a very few copies
have been thrown off, for preservation in the cabinets of such collectors as
do not object to antiquated scandal, and hold the opinion that, as
illustrative of the morals and manners of Edinburgh society of past times,
these satires have some value. Those readers, and they are not few, who are
familiar with the witty indelicacy of Dryden, Congreve, Wycherly, Behn,
Centlivre, and Shadwell, will not be disposed to find much fault with the
cutting sarcasm and coarse raillery of Pitcairn and Fynnie.

The worthy subject of the more interesting portion of these satires departed
this life upon the 6th of August 1706. Colonel Williamson, who died a few
years ago, was understood to have been his direct descendant. He did not
scruple, in his more convivial moments, to allude to the passages in arms of
an ancestor who had by his gallantry in an hour of peril performed a feat
which the Merry Monarch could hardly believe, and one which induced his
Majesty to appoint an interview with the reverend gentleman when in London.

Whether this gentleman was a son of Joseph Williamson, a member of the Faculty
of Advocates, is uncertain. The latter was either a son or grandson of the
clergyman, and purchased the estate of Foxhall in the County of West Lothian.
Becoming a neighbour of the Earl of Hopeton,
in the belief of the soundness of his legal knowledge, he was
so unlucky as to embark in a lawsuit with the noble Lord, in which the truth
of the old adage was verified, “ that he who acts as counsel in his own cause,
has a fool for his client.”

John Williamson, a Minister at Inveresk, was also a son of the Reverend David,
and after his father’s death, published some notes of his sermons, not
calculated to produce a favourable opinion of his parent’s theological powers.
In 1720 proposals were issued by this gentleman for publishing by subscription
“an essay on the Gospel method of conquering sinners unto Christ, &c., in ten
sermons preached several Lord’s days before the celebration of the sacrament
of the Lord's Supper." Whether this work ever appeared is doubtful.

It is believed, notwithstanding the number of wives, that the issue of the
Reverend David, at least in the male line, has failed. To what extent the
attacks on Williamson can be credited is somewhat difficult. His having seven
wives is beyond dispute, but his exploit at Cherrytrees is perhaps
exaggerated. In the memoirs of Captain John Creichton the circumstances of
this remarkable instance of physical power are given, but Creichton was a
Cavalier, and his memoirs were edited by Swift, no patron of covenanters. The
strongest authority against Williamson, is that of Bishop Sage, who, in his
remarks on that person’s sermon preached before the General Assembly, 4to,
1703, makes direct reference to the trick he “played to the Lady Cherrytrees."
In Pitcairn’s Assembly the story is assumed to_be in every respect true. An
interesting account of the murder of the young lady's uncle, preserved by
Wodrow, forms No. I. of the Appendix.

The allusion to the “Band Strings,” in the answer to the Roundel on the death
of Williamson is explained by the letter preserved among the MSS. of Robert
Mylne, which follows in the Appendix, No. II. In a collection of fugitive
papers and broadsides said to have been formerly in the possession of Lord
Fountainhall, there is a scurrilous and indecent song to be sung to the tune
of “John Paterson’s fole goes foremost,” in which Archbishop Paterson is
treated in a manner not particularly respectful. If any portion of the stories
is true, this ecclesiastical dignitary deserved expulsion from the church he
disgraced. But really, where there was so much bad blood between the
Presbyterians and the Episcopalians, it would puzzle a conjuror to ascertain
at the present time what amount of truth can be extracted from their mutual
accusations.

[[obliviad-1879]]
*The Obliviad: A Satire, with notes, together with additional Notes, Preface,
and Supplement, by the American Editor.  And the Perpetual Commentary of
the Athaeneum* (1879, 319) - William Leech & William Hepworth Dixon
- https://books.google.com/books?id=oNEVAAAAYAAJ[+https://books.google.com/books?id=oNEVAAAAYAAJ+]

*****
This is a very remarkable book, it consists of about 350 pages
in all, of which at least two thirds are occupied by
Notes, critical, satirical, and biographical, dealing with the
principal writers of the day, in a most unmerciful manner.
Even 'The Saturday Review,' which itself has a reputation for
sharp speaking, remarked (June 28, 1879):--:"'The Obliviad' is
a laborious imitation of the Dunciad, somewhat more universally
insolent in its treatment of contemporary authors than any
other satire in prose or verse that we remember."

Naturally a book which could speak with fearless truth of
the writings of such men as Tennyson, Robert Browning, Swinburne,
Dickens, Hepworth Dixon, and Robert Buchanan created a sensation,
but unfortunately the author was almost too indiscriminate in
his censures, for whilst everyone admits that the above
named authors have occasionally written absurd and
nonsensical works, it is equally certain that they did
not, in the the first place, make their names and fames
in that manner.

'The Obliviad' has been attributed to Dr. William
Leech of New York.

*Introduction*

The first edition of 'A Political Romance' (1759), reprinted here for the
first time, is a rare pamphlet from the pen of Laurence Sterne.  Indeed, it
was supposed until recently that this specimen of Sterne's humor, antedating
'Tristram Shandy,' existed in no other form than the one given it the year
after
Sterne's death in an edition brought out by a London bookseller named Murdoch,
with the assistance perhaps of John Hall-Stevenson, the author's intimate
friend.

*Chapter 1*

Of course,  it was very unfortunate that Alice 
should be ill at all, and it was certainly particularly unlucky that she
should have chosen the time when the summer holidays were just going to begin.

It was one lovely day towards the end of July when she first had a bad
headache and a hot tongue, and the doctor came and said that she was to stay
in her room as " he was not sure," but would come again next day. It was
terribly dull, though she had lots of books and papers to read. Alice liked
papers best, but really there was nothing much in them just then, except a
very long account of a trial in France, and a lot of speeches about "Home
Eule" and "Exclusion" and other things that she didn't understand. However,
she managed to find out that everyone was very concerned about the possibility
of civil war in Ireland, the question of whether people in
a really good social position ought not to be allowed to shoot editors if they
wanted to, and particularly the falling off of gates at county cricket
matches, and the difficulty of finding a first-class English heavyweight
boxer. It was on account of these last two troubles that most of the papers
agreed that the British Empire had begun to decline. There was a general
impression that the modern Englishman had no brains and less pluck, and would
be quite useless in an emergency. This was a bad look-out in itself, and the
papers pointed out that what made things worse was the horrible depravity of
our political leaders. Between them, they proved beyond a doubt that our
statesmen of all parties were quacks and liars, watching only their own
interests, and never for a moment considering those of the nation.

Alice was rather puzzled to know why, in that case, the nation chose such
people to look after its affairs, but she felt much too ill to try and think
it out. She had a vague recollection of being put to bed, and of someone
talking about "fever," and "delirious," and "very bad." She thought it was
silly of them to put her to bed, because she had heard that most people die in
their beds. She tried to explain that it would be safer for her to stop up,
but nobody took any notice. Then everything began to go round and round, and
to turn upside down and inside out, and some things got bigger and others
smaller, until it made her head ache to look at them, and she shut her eyes
and forgot about everything.

*****
A complete collection of the convivial and merry verse in the English language
would doubtless be of interest to scholars: but for most of us it would be
insufferably dull. The drinking songs of the eighteenth century alone, when
"bottle-companions" were issued by the dozen, would fill a library, and they
are mostly of inferior quality. In this book I have made no attempt to compile
a complete anthology. Of the old convivial literature I have omitted all save
those catches and longer songs which have seemed to me most likely to strike a
chord of sympathy in the heart of a modern,—and by no means all of those.
The 'Stag's Hornbook' is designed as a companion, not an encyclopedia. To
all who are interested in the historical aspects of English convivial verse,
I can do no better than recommend Hutchison's excellent collection, 'Songs
of the Vine.'

It is with more regret that I have omitted certain verses quite widely
admired, which are not disfigured by archaism. But it is not possible to
include everything. Lack of space makes it out of the question to include
those delightful long poems "Beer" by Charles Stuart Calverley, "The Tippling
Philosophers," "The Ballad of Bouillabaisse" by W. M. Thackeray, and "His
Farewell to Sack" by Robert Herrick. I have not succeeded in getting
sanction to include "The Maltworm's Madrigal" by Mr. Austin Dobson,
"Dekker's Song" by Mr. Alfred Noyes, and "Terence, This Is Stupid Stuff" by
Mr. A. E. Housman. And, after careful consideration—the size of this volume
being necessarily limited—I have omitted from the collection the following
standard verses which no doubt many readers of the 'Stag's Hornbook' will
expect to find: "Andro and His Cutty Gun"; "The Dirge of the Drinker" by W. E.
Aytoun; "Gane Is the Day and Mirk's the Night" and "Gude Ale Keeps the Heart
Abune" by Robert Burns; "With an Honest Old Friend" by Henry Carey; "The
Cruiskeen Lawn"; "The Monks of the Screw" by J. P. Curran; "Rum and Milk", by
C. W. Dalmon; "The Stoop of Rhenish" by John Davidson; "The Part'ing Glass" by
Philip Freneau; "The Spirit of Wine" by W. E. Henley; "On Lending a Punchbowl"
by Oliver Wendell Holmes; "The Jovial Priest's Confession"; "Give Me the Old"
by R. H. Messinger; "The Toper's Apology" by Captain Charles Morris; "Drink to
Her," "Fill the Bumper Fair," and "One Bumper at Parting" by Thomas Moore; "0
Gude Ale Comes and Gude Ale Goes"; "Old Wine" by W. M. Praed; "Oh, the Days
When I Was Young" by Richard Brinslev Sheridan; "When the Chill Charokkoe
Blows" "With My Jug in One Hand";—and of course a score of others.

*Lady Adela's Easter*

Lady Adela is one of those patricians who travel third class for the sake of
harrying the "lower orders."  In summer she likes the windows shut because she
suffers from hay fever; in winter she likes them open because she suffers from
headache.  At Easter it is more difficult to find a reason for being
disagreeable; but I have never known her fail.
