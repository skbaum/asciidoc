"KARMA Purple is a new saladette/large cherry tomato, bred by Karen Olivier (True North Tomatoes).  Ripe fruits start out as flattened saladettes, and end up as large cherry tomatoes.  KARMA Purple is a vigorous and productive "potato-leaf" variety -- producing ripe fruits approximately 75-80 days after transplant in our field.    

KARMA Purple fruits are bright and sweet, with very thin skins.  Even watering and harvesting prior to full ripening are necessary to avoid splitting.  

This variety was bred in Canada and was recently released by the breeder -- Karen Olivier.  To read more about Karen's varieties please visit her Northern Gardener page on Facebook.  Her KARMA tomatoes were bred in collaboration with Marsha Eisenberg."

Violet Jasper Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A unique cultivar from China. First offered at Seed Savers 2009 Yearbook by Hristo Hristov of Bulgaria as Tzi Bi U. Our TomatoFest seeds produce large, sturdy, regular leaf plants that yields clusters of jewel-like, 1-3 oz., smooth, purplish-red tomatoes with iridescent green streaks and a dark-purple red flesh. Fruit starts out with darker green stripes on typical unripe tomato green, and as they mature, the dark green stripes become slightly opalescent as the flesh darkens. I value this unique variety not as much for taste as for its ornamental quality. Rare tomato seeds."

Heritage Seed Market
--------------------

Amazon Chocolate Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Indeterminate, regular leaf plants that produce lots of deep purple beefsteaks with full, complex but sweet taste. This is one of the great flavors in tomatoes. Meaty and juicy, this works well in all tomato usages. Dark purple fruits and flesh with round or oblong slightly oblate shapes that range from 6 to 14 oz’s. Taste is not diminished by harvesting with good overall minimum blush and finishing ripening on the counter."

Benguet's Wild Cherry Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Benguet’s Wild Cherry” may not be the official name of this variety, as it may not actually have one. My friend in the Philippines, who has provided me with so many varieties that grow well in heat and humidity, sent me seeds for this cherry. He described it as: “…acquired foraged fruits from the highlands,” locally just called “Cherry Tomato.” The area he mentioned is the Province of Benguet, which is known as the “Salad Bowl of the Philippines” due to its huge production of upland vegetables. I have to say, this cherry tomato may grow well in the mountains, but it also grows extremely well at 33 feet above sea level, in my garden. I grew Benguet’s Wild Cherry in a pot the first year, and in the ground this year. I wanted to give it an extreme test, so I planted it in a bed I know to have bacterial wilt and nematodes. I cannot officially say that this variety has resistance or tolerance genetically to bacterial wilt and nematodes; however, the plants thrived throughout and slightly past my normal growing season. It also did not get late blight, which sweeps my garden every spring. The fruits are smooth, shiny, meaty and juicy bright red cherries. The size is about 0.6 ounces. The flavor is rich with sweetness but not sugary sweet. Benguet’s Wild Cherry is a standout in a salad or a pasta dish, such as the one I have here, of my linguini with cherry tomatoes and fresh mushrooms. This variety is joining my “WOW” list for its excellent strong flavor and vigorous performance in heat and humidity."

Black Strawberry Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Black Strawberry is a cross of Bosque Blue with Strawberry Tiger, created by J&L Gardens. This is a developing variety, and my fruits matched the phenotype described on the vendor’s site. These are saladette-sized blunt hearts, striking when unripe in the stripes and coloration. Black Strawberry is a small pink blunt heart, with gold stripes, and a purple wash draped over the shoulders and sides. The flavor is good, and the texture at fully ripe is a bit grainy to me."

Blue Dawg Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Blue Dawg” is the darkest anthocyanin variety I have ever grown. It took me a few tries to get “Blue” Dawg, having first grown a red cherry that was delicious but had no antho on the fruits, and a plant that gave me only one fruit, but it had some antho, and I saved seeds from it to plant this season. Those seeds produced plants with extremely inky purple-black, shiny, large cherries. They did seem to take forever to ripen, so I may not grow them again as I really have to struggle to harvest late varieties in my climate.

Blue Dawg is a creation by Tom Wagner. In 2013 post in a popular tomato forum, Mr. Wagner gave this history: “The Blue Dawg is going to be a winner and I will/may list it somewhere in one of my websites or I might send seed down south to be grafted later for the 2014 season.

Blue Dawg is incredibly firm with deep, deep red flesh. The vine is covered yet with fruit on a determinate vine. The fruit size is from 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Many, many crosses were made with it and if the F-1 samples work out well this winter….I may just keep it as an inbred to make hybrid seed only…I dunno.”

I didn’t feel that my plants, any of them, were determinate. I am calling them indeterminate; however, it is very possible that they were semi-determinate. The fruits were 1.5oz and are extremely firm. The flavor was odd. It was definitely not unpleasant, but not something I could easily describe…not your average tomatoey flavor. There was some sweetness, some acid, and then…something else. You will need to try it to see what I mean. Blue Dawg is listed as a developing variety because I have no idea what generation this is. I know that it was released and shared before it was stable."

Bob's Pickling Pepper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"[This] has an obscure background. My seed packet is a vendor’s packet, but I do not see it listed on the site anymore, and the packet was given in a trade. Hence, I have no history or other information.

This is indeed a great choice for pickling though. The flesh is thick and sweet and has no heat…except for the placenta ribs and the seeds. Those will tingle your tongue. You can pickle them whole and probably get some heat, or cut in half and pickle without the seeds for sweet pepper pickles.

And I have to mention the productivity! I have one poor plant that has been living in a 3 gallon pot for the past 8 months. I have fed it with liquid fertilizer twice…so it is rather neglected. Despite this shoddy care, Bob’s Pickling has pumped out three separate fruit settings, and each setting loaded the plant with fruit so that it looked like it was a Christmas tree decorated with shiny red ornaments. This is a VERY productive pepper, and can be grown in just about any setting.
The coin in the photo is a Susan B. Anthony “silver” dollar, so that is similar to a US quarter in size, maybe a tad smaller. Most of the fruits are 2 inches long."

Cascade Village Blue Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Cascade Village Blue” is a large cherry tomato with red flesh and purple shoulders, from a cross of Green Zebra with an anthocyanin variety. Cascade Village Blue is a creation of Tom Wagner’s. It does have a bit of concentric cracking on top with heavy rains. It has a full-bodied tomato flavor, not overly sweet, at full ripeness."

Cheste Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"This year, I grew the largest tomato I’ve ever grown. And, best of all, it really tastes good. This one gave me my new high of 3 lbs – 14.5 oz’s. I had three plants and the smallest fruit I harvested weighed in at 11 oz’s. Most were over 14 oz. Regular leaf foliage and pink fruit with fading green shoulders, this one is just pretty to look at. The taste is complex and satisfying with a touch of sweetness that reminds you that this Spanish Heirloom is the real deal."

Cosmic Eclipse Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Cosmic Eclipse” is an eye-catching variety from Brad Gates of Wild Boar Farms. Its flashy appearance made me wary of how it would taste. But beneath all of the stripes and spots and purple shoulders, there lies one delicious chocolate small salad tomato. The flesh is succulent, juicy, rich and sweet. This one is the best-tasting of all of the varieties from Mr. Gates that I have grown so far. I do not know if this is a stable variety yet, so I will list it as developing."

Criolla Quetzaltepeque Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A great little tomato from El Salvador. It is red with lovely scallops and a very strong acid flavor. One thing that makes this a very appealing tomato for me is that it has resistance to bacterial wilt. This means that people in the southeast US should be able to grow it in the ground, as I do, without problems. I listed this variety in Bunny Hop Seeds in fall 2014, and it sold out. Excellent stuffer and sauce tomato."

Giant Sweet Devil's Horn Pepper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Giant Sweet Devil’s Horn” is now my favorite sweet pepper, due to its large size, sweet and “Juicy-Fruit” fruity flavor, and prolific bearing on a strong plant. It also does not festoon its fruits with horrid spots of anthracnose, as many of my sweet peppers do in wet weather.

I first grew this pepper in 2015, and I wrote about it in the Doc and Katie’s Garden Xanadu gardening forum. Let me paste my report here:
“When I bought these seeds, the advertisement was “Giant Sweet Devil’s Horn.” Looked interesting. Big, orange, and said to be sweet. Okay, I’ll bite. I can’t find anything on this name though, so it may be something completely made up by the vendor. I have since seen it advertised by the same vendor on AliExpress, as “diablo cuerno súper gigante Behemoth pimienta dulce semillas frescas.” Well who can pass up a super gigante behemoth? Certainly not me! But more importantly, my fruits are looking exactly like the ones the vendor pictured, and the taste is excellent, fruity and sweet. Therefore, I am happy. The plant has 7 very large fruits on it right now, in the first bearing. None had BER. You all know my reputation for miniaturizing vegetables…well I can only guess how big this thing might grow for those of you who grow nice large veges.”

Since then, others in our forum have grown it and enjoyed the same yummy, productive results. I have not seen a negative review on this variety yet."

Guajito Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A difficult to find tomato from Mexico. It is an interesting long pear shape with thin neck (obovoid), about 3 inches long for me, grown in a pot; I expect it to be larger for those with mild climates who can grow tomatoes in the ground. Guajito is red with meaty flesh and dryness of a paste variety. This accession from GRIN belongs to the “Regional Latin American Lines” varieties, so I look it as one of those forgotten heirlooms."

Helsing Junction Blue Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Helsing Junction Blue” won my taste test first place spot this year for best rich, sweet flavor in all dark anthocyanin cherries that I trialed. It is a creation of Tom Wagner, named after the Helsing Junction Farm in the Chehalis River Valley, near Rochester, Washington state. According to Mr. Wagner’s TaterMaterSeeds Proboards forum, the name is “Blue” and not “Blues.” This is shown in both his comments and his photos. Not sure where or when an “s” was added to the name, nor who did it…so I will stick with the original name spelling…with the exception that my first set of seed packet labels do have the “s” as I printed them before learning this information.

Mr. Wagner stated his intent for this variety: “The main idea of this topic is to show how the blue tomato bred into a thin walled cherry tomato…carries the blue down into the pericarp almost to the seed locule. Remove the seed and you can see the blue from inside the locule….larger tomatoes don’t have this feature.”

http://tatermater.proboards.com/thread/417/helsing-junction-blue-tomato[`http://tatermater.proboards.com/thread/417/helsing-junction-blue-tomato`]

Helsing Junction Blue has gorgeous foliage (yes, I have a thing for interesting foliage in tomato plants). It curls genetically. This does allow maximum sunlight to reach the developing fruits, and hence a very dark anthocyanin coloring may be found when growing this variety. Just remember when you are growing these plants that the foliage is supposed to curl a bit and do not overwater them, trying to get the curl to go away.

The fruits at full ripeness have strong sweetness and strong acid with the rich flavor I normally find in dark-fleshed varieties. The gel turns a deep crimson when completely ripe. The flesh is firm but not crunchy.

This is another tomato that has the look of retained chlorophyll in the fruit flesh, even to the center. Perhaps it is bleeding through of the anthocyanin to an extent that is maximized in appearance because of the small fruit size. Yet the flesh does not taste inky. It tastes of a chocolate tomato.
Helsing Junction Blue was midseason for me, although it was early compared with other anthocyanin cherries."

Kara Market Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A strong-tasting small red paste, with dry high pectin flesh, from South Africa. It sets fruit prolifically and has heat set capability. Interestingly, I had it growing in a row with other varieties, none of which are known to have bacterial wilt resistance. All of the plants in this row eventually acquired and died from bacterial wilt except for Kara Market. It may be possible that it has at least moderate resistance to bacterial wilt, I cannot prove this by any means and will continue to grow it in the ground to test specifically for this trait.

The history of seed acquirement for Kara Market in the US is said to have been from a tomato bought at a market in Kara, Toga, Africa."

Kewalo Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"One of the first varieties I was able to successfully grow in the ground here in the Florida Panhandle. It was developed by UH-CTAHR (College of Tropical Agriculture, University of Hawaii) to have specific traits that would enable survival against nematodes, heat, humidity, and diseases specific to a hot, humid climate with sandy soil. Kewalo is reportedly tolerant to bacterial wilt and tobacco mosaic virus, resistant to nematodes, fusarium wilt, gray leaf spot and one strain of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). I cannot confirm or deny any of these except for resistance to nematodes, tolerance (which actually looked more like resistance) to bacterial wilt, and possible resistance to a strain of TSWV. It also sets fruit in the heat.

I did act upon a quest this year to find and list the heat tolerant red slicers with the best flavor. Kewalo was in this group, and its excellent smooth flavor and meaty texture pushed it to the top four varieties in this group."

Kurdish Red Cherry Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A variety that you might not find in the seed catalogs. This is an heirloom with a story, and my seeds came from the person telling the story, who is a wonderful friend and member of our gardening forum. Let me share this with you:

“The story is as such. In a pizzeria where I live, I met a worker there about 10 years ago (he still works there) and talked about life in general with him each time I visited. But, we talked about something very important and that was growing tomatoes. This man came to Canada from Kurdistan about 20 years ago with a group of people. One in the group brought back tomato seeds from their country and they have been growing these tomatoes here ever since. I was fortunate enough to obtain seeds from my friend and I will be growing them this year.”

The photo of the dried fruit with seeds shows how my friend received the seeds he first grew. This is his photo, and I love it as it shows just how we who are crazy to grow tomatoes can manage to get seeds in so many ways. My friend shared seeds with many members of our forum, and those who grew it all spoke highly of the flavor and productivity. Kurdish Red Cherry produces well in the heat, and is crazily productive in temperate weather. In my own garden it did not like the constant rain and nightly 100% humidity this season, but I do plan to grow it again next season and increase the seed count in my packets. Lovely shiny red cherries, strong fine flavor, and easy to grow…recommended!"

Ladybug Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"One of three tomato varieties I grew this season that proceeded to flood me out of house and home with their abundant fruiting. This is a Russian variety, so far as I know, but it took everything my garden could throw at it…heat, humidity, insects…and just kept making tomatoes. This is described as being a 2 foot tall determinate, but I found it to be more of 2.5 to 3 feet tall grown in an Earth Box with happy soil and nutrients.

Ladybug’s fruits are shiny fire-engine red, elongated cherries. I suppose one could think of them as cute ladybugs. The flavor is strong, and there is more juice and gel than flesh. Because of this, I did best enjoy slices of Ladybug on top of a Triscuit (black pepper and sea salt flavor) with a spoon of homemade blue cheese dip (lots of blue cheese, touch of sugar, coarsely ground black pepper, cream cheese, bit of whipping cream…not especially heart healthy, but so delicious).

If you are a person with plenty of experience in planting tomatoes and getting a very scanty harvest, you might want to try Ladybug to bring about a sea-change."

Lila Sari Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Lila Sari” is reportedly from India. It produces medium to large mostly globe-shaped purple slicers with small cores and little waste. Some have compared it favorably with Cherokee Purple. I can’t say that one is better than the other…Cherokee Purple is excellent. But my tasting notes confirm, “Tangy, very sweet, rich, turgid smooth flesh, juicy, nom-nom-nom!”"

Mapalad Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A yummy little red paste variety from the Philippines. The Tagalog word “mapalad” translates directly to “blessed” in English, but can also mean “lucky” or “fortunate.” And fortunate is the gardener who tries this variety! It is a little workhorse and laughs at heat and humidity. In fact, there were more fruits on the plant when I had to stop picking because I could no longer tolerate the heat that late in the season. The fruits did not crack in our heavy rain, although any variety may crack if deluged after a period of dryness. The outside of the fruits were firm but the flesh was very soft at full ripeness. The flesh was quite sweet for a plum/paste variety. If there is a disadvantage at all, it is that the fruits are a little small for processing…all those skins to remove! I could not find the growth habit designation, although this appears to be a commercial variety distributed by Pilipinas Kaneko Seeds Corporation, a Philippine branch of Japan’s Kaneko Seeds Company. The growth habit appeared determinate to me, and did well in a true 5 gallons bucket of soil."

Napa Rose Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Named after the wine and not a flower, this is one of the best cherry tomatoes I have eaten so far. It is definitely my favorite of all of the varieties from Brad Gates that I have ever grown. To give you a better idea, Napa Rosé has earned a place on my short “WOW” flavor list. Sweet, yes. Tangy, yes. FRUITY with a strong sugar and tang that linger in the mouth…oh yes. I know, because I forced myself to try it several times (purely scientific interest…I was not EATING my seed stock!). The cherries are shiny/glossy and plump, yielding to the touch, and a deep rose when ripe. Juicy and seedy. The unripe fruits are beautiful…image doesn’t do them justice…pale pink on the bottom and pale jade on the top. I can see why this was named a rosé wine.

Please note that I am marking this as a developing variety, although it is likely stable. The reason for this is that my plants and the unripe fruits initially had a slight anthocyanin dusting (the plants more than the fruits) that disappeared when the weather warmed and the fruits ripened. This antho could have been simply an environmental expression of the normal anthocyanin reaction in tomato plants that carry the gene, rather than a reflection of a deliberate cross to bring out significant purple expression. The thing that makes me cautious is that Mr. Gates stated that Napa Rosé is a sister line to Blue Boar Berry, which expresses notable anthocyanin. One thing is for certain, and that is the fact that it was released without anthocyanin in the ripe fruits, and you should have rosy pink fruits with no purple dusting at full ripeness."

Nueva Vizcaya Nipple Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A seemingly a regional tomato from the Philippines. A wonderful friend from the Philippines provided the seeds from the source (thank you Adobo!), and my fruits are true to the photo he also sent. So…it laughs at the heat and humidity. It has very thick red flesh and gel with few seeds. The red plums have a nice balanced flavor for fresh eating and sauce. Productivity is high. Now I have three really nice plums from the Philippines: Mapalad, Rica, and NV Nipple Tomato. Of the three, this one is the largest and prettiest. It appears to be determinate. In short, another winner for those who garden in the heat and humidity, such as the southeast US!"

Nyana Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Reportedly comes from Kenya, and the name means “tomato” in Kenya’s national language of Swahili. “Nyana” means “tomato” in Tanzania, which is Kenya’s immediate neighbor, and also uses Swahili as a main language. When I attempt a Swahili translation of “Nyana,” however, I get the English word “son.” I will list this with the spelling that appears to translate directly to “tomato.” I am not certain if there is a separate designation for plum as opposed to round or oblate tomato, but this one makes small, blunt plums. As you may guess, it does well in the heat.

The fruits are meaty, with a very strong flavor and fragrance (the fragrance of this tomato is stronger than any other I have tried). If your favorite tomatoes are extra sweet and extra mild, then this one probably isn’t for you…for fresh eating. For using in cooking to create sauces that actually taste of tomatoes, this variety is for everyone. As you can see from my photo, the stink bugs loved this one too. I am starting to think of stink bug preference as an endorsement for strong tomato flavor and condensed sugars."

Post Office Spoonful Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A super-flavorful and apparently disease resistant (late blight) red currant tomato.This tomato has a story that maybe many of you already know. Here is the history, as related by the kind lady who sent me seeds.

When she was a girl, Pittsburgh folk singer Cathasaigh (that’s her full, legal name) encountered a very old man planting tomato plants in front of a post office. The man explained that seeds of these tomatoes had been brought over by his grandmother from Italy, and the tomato had been grown by his family for generations. The man was getting too old to garden, so he planted his last seedlings in front of the post office. It was his hope that people would taste the tomatoes, like them, and plant the seeds so this wonderful tomato could continue. His term for the currant tomatoes was “spoonfuls.” Cathasaigh tasted, liked, and planted the tomato for years, naming it “Post Office Spoonful.” She gave seeds to Nancy Carr, who grew them out and sent them to many tomato growers.

Purple Reign Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Purple Reign” (Dwarf Purple Reign) is a fine dwarf from Dean Slater's (of Mariseeds: https://www.mariannasheirloomseeds.com/) cross of Big Cheef and Dean's Gandolf line. It produces better than many other dwarf varieties in my heat and humidity. Nice purple beefsteaks on a vigorous but compact (3 feet for me) dwarf plant. The flesh is sweet, smooth, and soft at fully ripe.

These are now F8 seeds, so although my fruits have all been true to type across several plants and two seasons, I will list this as a developing variety. This means that there is a chance that plants and fruit grown from these seeds will be different than what I have shown and described here. I believe that it is stable, but I would rather be cautious in my listings and state the possibilities."

Raspberry Mochi Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"“Raspberry Mochi” is an original creation by Bunny Hop Seeds. This is a raspberry-purple large salad tomato, with a sweet, balanced flavor. The name “mochi” is given to a Japanese confection with a chewy rice dough on the outside and a filling that is usually quite sweet. When I tasted this segregate, I was reminded of my favorite treat, just as with a sister line, Daifuku. And like Daifuku, Raspberry Mochi has a small core, with little to no waste. The flesh is plump and smooth, with luscious gel. Raspberry Mochi is more productive, on a larger plant, with larger fruits that are not quite as sweet when compared to Daifuku.

This cross came about in 2013, when I tried to find a tomato variety of any color but red, that could be grown in the ground in my challenging climate and under a large insect/disease load. I did not find one. So, I made a cross of a disease-resistant red salad hybrid, BHN 669 F1, to a delicious and renowned purple beefsteak, Black from Tula. The cross was successful, and several segregates were pursued.
Now in the F6 generation, the segregate “Raspberry Mochi” is stable. Each generation has been grown in my native soil, which is poor, sandy, acidic, and liberally laced with bacterial wilt and nematodes. Raspberry Mochi has tolerated these conditions plus heat and humidity without difficulty. I highly recommend Raspberry Mochi to anyone who struggles to grow heirloom tomatoes in a hot, humid climate and who loves sweet, smooth, large salad tomatoes with perfect form and no waste."

Tsindao Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Tsindao has surprising sweetness for a chocolate/black tomato, with excellent flavor and texture. The inner flesh is crimson at dead ripe. Tsindao was not as productive as Midnight in Moscow in my 2015 spring trial. However, it made a huge comeback in the spring of 2016 and produced literally a box full of 1/2 to 1 pound tomatoes, with a few larger than that. Tsindao has continued to produce excellently since then. It is a Russian commercial variety producing medium chocolate-brown beefsteaks, 5-8 oz. Tsindao (Циндао, Qingdao) is the name of a city in China's East Shandong province, on the shore of the Yellow Sea. This variety is reported to have heat tolerance, and three online Russian tomato forums praised Tsindao for its excellent flavor over other chocolate tomatoes and also discussed the heat tolerance."

Natsu Fushinari is a high yielder due to setting fruit at every node.We picked up these seeds from Baker Creek and they have quickly become our favorite greenhouse cucumber.  We then crossed them with some other of our favorite varieties with the goal to improve powdery mildew resistance, vigor and a prolonged high yielding production window. Producing from early June until Mid October on our farm. A bit later to produce than f1 Corinto with similar yields and better flavor. We plant about 70% of our greenhouse cukes to this hybrid swarm this season and they didn’t disappoint.  This is highly selected “stock seed” grade seed.  Limited Supply. (note, there may be a few crosses with other popular F1 Cucumbers that we also grow)

Oh My Hybrid Swarm Tomato
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A refined medium to large black tomato with added vigor, crack resistance and amazing flavor! We have been hard at work over the last 6 years to breed a black tomato that’s production rivals that of any tomato we grow. The blacks with their incredible flavor are always a hit at the farmers market but their lack in productivity has always been a set back.   This new black is making the production of these tasty heirlooms a very profitable endeavor. Our 2019 hybrid seed impressed beyond our wildest dreams being both early, incredibly productive, sustaining production into the  early winter. These tomatoes have shown great immunologic response (disease resistance) and are great choices for heirloom production in the greenhouse. We are currently committing 50% of our farm to the production of this crowd favorite tomato ( a dead ringer for Black Krim or Cherokee purple but with increased yield)."

Basil (Crimson King)
--------------------

"80 days from sowing.

Crimson King is destined for a long and glorious reign in American gardens! This Genovese-type basil, bred in England as an improvement over the popular Red Rubin (which we still love for its own merits as well!), is as ornamental as it is delicious!

You will smell Crimson King before you see it, the huge, lightly cupped violet leaves releasing a spicy clove aroma. Fabulous for cooking or in fresh dishes, Crimson King is a generous producer, with good branching on plants that reach 18 inches high and about a foot wide. Compact enough for containers, they stand out nicely wherever they are planted!

And Crimson King is not a fussy grower. You won't find those depressing green off-shoots that so many red-leafed varieties have -- Crimson King is 100% purple, no matter what the weather does! The growth is vigorous, too, so that you can expect to begin harvesting big, delectable leaves in less than 3 months from sowing the seed.

Basil is content to begin life indoors or out. If sowing indoors, start the seeds 6 to 8 weeks before last scheduled frost; they germinate in about 5 to 10 days, and can be transplanted when they have at least 2 sets of true leaves and the soil has warmed up.

To direct-sow them, wait for the soil temperature to reach 70 degrees or soIf you are direct-sowing, wait until the soil has thoroughly warmed up in spring. Then cover the seeds with about ¼-inch of soil, and thin the young plants to 12 to 15 inches apart when they are about 2 inches tall."

Basil (Emily)
-------------

"Loaded with volatile oils, basil is responsible for the heady aroma and strong flavors essential to so many recipes. With a wide range of flavors and colors, basil is used in everything from making Italian pesto to flavoring vegetables and fish. Basil plants, particularly the purple-leaved varieties, are also attractive in the flower garden, and many can be used as cut flowers. Basil can also be used as a companion plant to repel aphids, mites, and tomato hornworms. Compact but abundant, this bushy looking Organic Basil is a perfect herb for your sun patio pot. Emily is an easy growing, tender herb who prefers warm growing conditions, so be sure to bring her inside if temps are below 60 degrees. A rich flavor makes Emily the perfect Basil for pesto."

"A unique lime-flavored basil from Thailand. Popular variety for fresh market!"

"Well the reviews were right, this basil did not disappoint! I grew this along with some other basils and absolutely loved it. Zero pest problems and it was easily grown, even in the shade of a bean trellis. The leaves were slightly smaller, the flowers were beautiful. I dried some and made pesto (still pulling little jars out of the freezer) and I gotta say, we all love it just as much as the regular pesto! Even now that I am out of dried basil, the lime basil has been a delightful substitute. Growing again."

Basil (Marseille)
-----------------

"70 days from sowing.

If you've ever strolled through a big patch of Basil on a summer afternoon, you know that mouth-watering, delectable aroma. Well, you can get that every day -- and from just one plant! -- of Marseille. This French variety is the unquestioned queen of fragrance, with foliage so aromatic you'll find yourself making excuses to go out to the garden or patio and brush past it!

A dwarf plant, Marseille apparently concentrates all its energy on producing big, showy, wonderfully scented foliage. The leaves are larger than most other varieties, and the plant is nicely branched, so you get a big harvest in very little space. Expect Marseille to reach 10 inches high and about 8 inches wide at maturity, bursting with delectable spice in every inch!

Marseille is a fine variety for growing in containers, and if you scatter a few among your unscented annual flowering plants, you'll find that bees and butterflies are suddenly visiting! And of course Basil is indispensable to Tomatoes, so be sure to include it among the Tomatoes, Eggplants, and other members of your "lasagne garden"!

The perfect size for a low hedge, Marseille makes an aromatic edging for the driveway or footpaths. Talk about an edible ornamental -- you can grab a few leaves in passing as you enter the house and get a delectable head start on dinner!"

Basil (Minette)
---------------

"65 days from sowing.

Minette is one of the most eye-catching basils you will ever see! It creates perfect 10-inch spheres of bright green that stay compact and uniform all season. Minette is ideal for edging, miniature knot gardens, or in containers. Pick the flavorful leaves and use fresh or dried in tomato dishes, pasta sauces, vegetables and soups.You can also use it in the garden as a companion plant to repel aphids, mites, and tomato hornworms.

This variety grows only 10 inches high and wide, creating a perfectly uniform sphere. The tiny medium green leaves are only ½-inch long. Small spikes of white flowers arise in summer; if you are growing Minetter for culinary purposes, pinch off the buds. If it is an ornamental or guard plant in your garden, let the flowers open and the butterflies visit!

Begin the seeds either indoors in late winter or direct-sow in spring. To start indoors, sow about 6 to 8 weeks before last scheduled frost. The seeds will germinate in 5 to 10 days. Transplant when they have 2 sets of true leaves, spacing the plants 8 to 10 inches apart in the garden, or in your best containers."

Basil (Nufar)
-------------

"70 days from sowing.

If you have ever had your basil plants suddenly die from the Fusarium oxysporum (commonly known as fusarium wilt), then you must try Basil Nufar - it is the first ever sweet basil variety resistant to this nasty disease. In addition to its disease-fighting properties, Nufar is a delicious culinary herb, and a great guard plant for tomatoes and other vegetables in the garden.

Fusarium wilt is a fungal disease that causes sudden and unexplainable wilting, defoliation, and death of your plant. It spreads easliy through contact with other infected plants and through contaminated seeds. There is no known cure. But you can rest assured that Nufar will outlast any outbreak!

A Genovese-type basil, Nufar will provide you with months of large, flavorful leaves for cooking. Pick the leaves and use fresh or dried in tomato dishes, pasta sauces, vegetables and soups. You can also use basil in the garden as a companion plant to repel aphids, mites, and tomato hornworms.

Nufar grows 18 to 24 inches high and 12 to 15 inches wide. The dark green, shiny leaves grow up to 2 inches long on a tall, erect plant that is slow to bolt. You'll enjoy big harvests from this ultra-healthy, dependable variety. It makes a great choice for new gardeners, as well as those looking to grow without any sprays or artificial additives in the garden."

Basil (Persian)
---------------

"Really interesting and flavorful! Known as Reyhan throughout the varied nations of southwestern Asia. Has a distinctive aroma, both lemony and spice-like."

"Aside from the stunning beauty of the full, strong growing, purple tipped plants, these have astounding flavor. It's less grassy, less cloying than common "sweet basil" and has a sophisticated, more peppery overtone. Whereas some basil types can smell almost skunky, this has a brighter scent. We loved it in chicken meatballs, and I would grow it every year for that alone, even if it wasn't a showstopper in a garden bed."

Basil (Red Rubin)
-----------------

"The perfect combination of ornamental appeal and intense, spicy flavor, Red Rubin is the best red-leafed Basil we have ever grown here at Park, bar none! Its compact little habit, handsome foliage, and wonderful aroma make it welcome in any sunny setting, while its flavorful leaves make it a must-grow for lovers of flavored vinegars and oils!

The leaves are smooth, flat, and large, about 3 to 4 inches long and borne very profusely on dense, full little plants a foot tall and 8 to 10 inches wide. The shape and texture of the leaves will remind you of large flat-leafed Italian types, and the intensity of the bite lives up to this reputation! The plant itself is so charming that it makes a nice container choice as well as accent plantings in the herb garden or a very showy edging for the annual bed.

Best of all, Red Rubin is the easiest Basil to grow from seed you will find! Its germination rate is much higher than that of other varieties, so you can count on a few extra plants from every packet of seed!

Like all Basils, Red Rubin can be direct-sown in spring or begun indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before last frost. Maintain a temperature of around 70 degrees F and expect to see little sprouts in 5 to 10 days! Then, when the seedlings are about 6 inches high, pinch away the central stem. This will help side-shoots grow, and keep the plant from flowering too quickly.

If you want to use the leaves fresh, pick them as they mature. A good rule of thumb is to wait until the stems have at least 8 leaves, then harvest all but the first set (the one closest to the base of the stem). This way, you will stimulate new growth on existing stems, keep the plant trim and tidy, and get the maximum harvest from every Red Rubin! (If you pinch back and harvest as we've described here, you can probably get about a third to a half cup of leaves every week from each plant!)

If cut-and-come-again harvesting is not for you, you can also harvest the entire plant at once. Wait until you see flower buds. Then cut the entire plant at the base and hang it upside-down in a cool, dry location for drying, or cut the individual stems at the base and freeze them with their leaves still attached. (Freezing is the better way for full flavor retention, but it's hard to beat the smell of a basil plant hanging in your pantry, so the choice is yours -- perhaps a little of both methods?!)

You will love the sight, scent, and flavor of this delicious red-leafed Basil.  68 days from sowing."

Cucumber (Tasty King Japanese Hybrid)
-------------------------------------

"62 days. I introduced this variety in my Totally Tomatoes catalog in the mid 1990s and it quickly became my most popular burpless cuke. Japanese bred, completely burpless, 10-in. long, dark green, thin-skinned, tender and slender at only 1½-in. across. Flavor is mild and sweet, with a crisp, crunchy texture, whether grown in the garden or green-house. Superb disease resistance. Needs support for optimal results."

https://www.seedsnsuch.com/product/tasty-king-japanese-hybrid/[+https://www.seedsnsuch.com/product/tasty-king-japanese-hybrid/+]

"60-70 days. An oriental-type, hybrid Cucumber direct from Japan, Tasty King produces loads of great tasting, burpless Cucumbers that are amazingly long. Imagine that: they can grow to 18" long but still stay thin, remaining less than 2" thick. To obtain these wondrously long, straight Cucumbers, grow the vigorous vines on a strong trellis so that the fruits can hang down. These very dark, thin-skinned beauties have a small seed cavity and thick, crisp and delicious flesh. Tasty King is best when picked at an immature stage of about 12" to use for pickling, tossed salads and marinated Cucumber salads."

Eggplant (Kamo)
---------------

"My favorite of all eggplants, even more so than Pingtung Long. It is a beautiful and delicious eggplant heirloom from Kyoto, Japan. The flesh is creamy and tender, while the skin is deep, matte purple, like satin.

My first introduction to this variety was in the 1990’s, when I used to watch the TV show “Iron Chef” (Japan). One episode featured eggplants as the main ingredient…and not just any eggplant, but the Kamo eggplant. It was described as the best gourmet eggplant in Japan as well as the most expensive. Thin slices of the raw vegetable were given to the judges during the cooking battle. How I wished at that time to try this eggplant myself! And after many years, I received seeds and found that the claim to fame for this vegetable was true.

It is not likely that you will find these in the grocery stores, or probably even in the Farmers’ Markets (unless perhaps they feature many Japanese vegetables). If you like eggplants at all, I encourage you to give Kamo a try."

Lavender (Munstead)
-------------------

"English Lavender is one of the richest in essential oils, meaning more fragrance power both fresh and dried. And Munstead, grown for its compact habit and earlier-blooming flowers, is one of the best English Lavender varieties of all, fabulously fragrant and absolutely beautiful. Add this evergreen perennial to your dry, sun-soaked border or meadow garden today, and begin enjoying years of beauty and fragrance!

The foliage of this bushy, naturally rounded Lavender is blue-green, with a silvery sheen in the summer sun. The foliage is as strongly scented as the blooms, making a fine choice to edge a pathway or place near a conversation area of the garden. Bees and butterflies adore it, of course, but not as much as you will!

Munstead is the creation of famed British gardener, garden designer, and writer Gertrude Jekyll. It is named for her home, Munstead Wood, in Surrey. Introduced during World War I, this variety has been a perpetual favorite ever since, thanks to its multitude of blooms, its compact and very full habit, and its eagerness to grow and bloom in less-than-ideal settings.

Expect Munstead to reach 12 to 18 inches high and up to 24 inches wide, with small, strongly scented foliage that opens gray-blue, acquiring green and silvery hues as it matures. The flowerstems reach a foot long, packed with intensely colored purple florets in mid- to late summer. Magnificent!

Munstead is glorious in the garden, asking only for a quick trim in early spring and again right after it blooms. Grow it in well-drained soil in an open, sunny spot, or in a large container. Rosemary is a traditional companion, but Munstead pairs with almost any flowering annual or perennial, and is a lovely foreground planting for a shrub border. Zones 5-9."

My yard is both a Monarch Way Station as well as a Certified Wildlife Habitat location. The tithonia torch is by far the "go to" favorite flower for a variety of butterflies ... especially the monarch and swallowtail butterflies. I grew planted six different stalks this year and there is at least 20-30 different butterflies in my yard at one time, all throughout the blooming season. Because of the high rate of daily nectaring, I try to remove the dead flowers several times a week which only encourages more blooms to emerge. I cannot recommend this flower enough for any monarch and/or swallowtail butterfly lover."

Momordica Charantia
-------------------

"Annual plant with vines grow up to 3m. Forms a large fruit, oblong-oval shape with strong knobby surface and an average weight of 150-200g. Use 8-10-day-old immature green fruit with a sour-bitter, but pleasant taste of flesh. Consume them fresh and canned."

https://nikitovka.com/en/momordica/386-momordica-charantia-4823024911925.html[+https://nikitovka.com/en/momordica/386-momordica-charantia-4823024911925.html+]

"Momordica charantia (colloquially: bitter melon; bitter apple; bitter gourd; bitter squash; balsam-pear; with many more names listed below)[1] is a tropical and subtropical vine of the family Cucurbitaceae, widely grown in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean for its edible fruit. Its many varieties differ substantially in the shape and bitterness of the fruit. 

This herbaceous, tendril-bearing vine grows up to 5 m (16 ft) in length. It bears simple, alternate leaves 4–12 cm (1.6–4.7 in) across, with three to seven deeply separated lobes. Each plant bears separate yellow male and female flowers. In the Northern Hemisphere, flowering occurs during June to July and fruiting during September to November.

The fruit has a distinct warty exterior and an oblong shape. It is hollow in cross-section, with a relatively thin layer of flesh surrounding a central seed cavity filled with large, flat seeds and pith. The fruit is most often eaten green, or as it is beginning to turn yellow. At this stage, the fruit's flesh is crunchy and watery in texture, similar to cucumber, chayote or green bell pepper, but bitter. The skin is tender and edible. Seeds and pith appear white in unripe fruits; they are not intensely bitter and can be removed before cooking.

Some sources claim the flesh (rind) becomes somewhat tougher and more bitter with age, but other sources claim that at least for the common Chinese variety the skin does not change and bitterness decreases with age. The Chinese variety are best harvested light green possibly with a slight yellow tinge or just before. The pith becomes sweet and intensely red; it can be eaten uncooked in this state, and is a popular ingredient in some Southeast Asian salads.

When the fruit is fully ripe, it turns orange and soft, and splits into segments which curl back to expose seeds covered in bright red pulp."

Okra (Beck's Big Buck)
----------------------

"Beck’s Big Buck okra makes very fat, ribbed pods that remind me of Star of David, except that the new growth has a bit of red, and the harvest size for tender pods in length and circumference was a bit smaller for me with Beck’s Big Buck. The history is lovely, and looks to be reported accurately by Fedco Seeds, “When Malcolm and Delphine Beck bought their farm in 1968 in Comal County, Texas, they found in the abandoned garden giant okra stalks with the fattest pods they’d ever seen. They saved and replanted the seed, and it grew big fluted remarkably tender delicious green pods in abundance on sturdy plants. They called it the snapping okra because it snaps so easily off the plants when it is ready to harvest."

The unique, complex taste is most often compared to cilantro, but also sometimes to arugula, lemon, and even rue. Generally used raw; great in tacos, salsa, and many other Mexican dishes. Like cilantro, it is loved by many and hated by a few, although many prefer one to the other. Once established, papalo grows quickly and easily. One planting can provide fresh greens for months. May self-sow in warm areas."

"Traditional Mexican herb commonly used fresh with salads, sandwiches, soups, stews, meats or beans. Fast-growing, providing you with plenty of fresh growth to harvest all summer long! Grows up to 6 feet tall in a single summer if not kept cut back."

"Pápalo, also known as pápaloquelite among other names, is an herb used in Mexican cooking that has a very strong and exotic aroma and flavor. It is similar to cilantro with a citrus-lemony flavor. It is most popular in Central Mexico and in particular the state of Puebla. People in other parts of Mexico may not be familiar with it.

There are two distinct types of pápalo, shown in a picture below, both of which have a similar aroma. One has supple leaves and the other is made up of thin stems. In a wholesale market in Puebla, vendor refereed to both of them as “pápalo”, but would call the one with stems “pápaloquelite” to differentiate from the type with supple leaves.

The most common species found for the type with supple leaves is Porophyllum ruderale; other species identified for these two types of pápalo are Porophyllum linaria, Porophyllum macrocephalum and Porophyllum tagetoides.

This herb is used fresh to flavor tacos and beans, among other dishes. In some Mexican restaurants, stems of the herb are left in vases on the table and customers will take leaves to put on certain dishes."

Pepper (Hangjiao Comet's Tail)
------------------------------

"In 1987 Jiang Xingcun, a scientist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, discovered that sending vegetable seeds including chilli seeds into space exposing them to zero gravity increased the mutation rates by hundreds of times. This method resulted in increased size of the chillies and improved yield. The reason for the space programs were to find a solution on how to feed China’s  growing population. Since that time, China has sent more than 400 plant seed species to space.

The Hangjiao no 4, also known as Comet’s Tail, is another awesome chilli pepper that has spend time in zero gravity. It grows to about 50-60 cm in a pot. The Hangjiao 4 Comet’s Tail pods are huge, they grow up to 30 cm long and 2-3 cm wide and twisted. Like the other space chillies it is very prolific.

Sweet and a bit bitter. Would be great in a salsa, a salad, a stir-fry, or just as a snack.

This is the most disease-resistant pumpkin we’ve ever grown or seen. Unlike most pumpkin varieties that start to die in summer when extreme heat arrives, Cherokee Tan Pumpkins just keep producing. The vines are extremely vigorous and should be given plenty of room to grow.

Cherokee Tan Pumpkin is a pie pumpkin variety that is great to eat and stores extremely well. In some instances, these pumpkins have been noted to store a year in ideal conditions. Fruits average 3-4 lbs and have a small seed cavity with large amounts of delicious pumpkin meat. Plants will produce at least 10-15 pumpkins per plant, but even greater production is not unusual. This is a great variety for southern climates where growing pumpkins can be difficult to disease and insect pressure."

Roselle (St. Kitts and Nevis)
-----------------------------

"(Hibiscus sabdariffa) Highly productive strain, great for Deep South growers. Louise Divine and Herman Holley of Turkey Hill Farm in Tallahassee, Florida have grown many different roselles, and say this is the best for them, bearing loads of large, dark red calyxes from September through November. Here in Virginia, the large plants are 12-18 in. taller than Thai Red Roselle, but flower 6 weeks later, so it may not make sizable calyxes before frost. Small (0.6 g) packet has about 20 seeds.

Growing instructions: Frost-tender perennial. Germination: 75-85°F, 7-14 days. Transplant after last frost. Full sun. 4-5.5 ft. tall. Space plants 3-6 ft. apart – the wider the spacing, the more calyxes will ripen."

https://www.southernexposure.com/products/roselle-st-kitts-and-nevis/[+https://www.southernexposure.com/products/roselle-st-kitts-and-nevis/+]

"Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) is also called Florida cranberry, red sorrel, or Jamaica sorrel, although it is actually native to Central and West Africa and is grown around the world. The part of the plant that is edible are the calyces of the roselle flower which can be used to make a variety of jams, sauces, and teas.

Roselle produces attractive foliage and flowers and will reach a height of about 7 feet. Many parts of the plant, including the seeds, leaves, fruits, and roots, are used medicinally or in foods. The leaves are lobed and reddish-green and can be used as a cooked green or added raw for a nice "zing" to a salad. Appearing in October, the flowers are typically yellow with a dark center and about 3 inches wide. The part of the plant most popular however, is found at the bottom of each flower. This fleshy, bright red cup-like structure contains the plant's seeds and is called a calyx. The color and tart taste of the calyces makes them a good replacement for cranberries.

In the Caribbean, roselle is used to make a festive Christmas drink. Bakers can substitute roselle for rhubarb when making a fruit crisp or pie. The seeds, which are high in protein, can be roasted and brewed like coffee, or ground and added to soups and salads. The nutrient-rich calyces can either be stored frozen or dried for making cordials, punches, and jams. The calyces can also be used to add color and flavor to herb teas. Be sure to harvest calyces before they turn brown on the plant and separate them from the seeds before using them in recipes."

Expect excellent DM resistance, productivity and keeping quality, as well as rich sweet flavor. Immature fruits are mostly dark green. These ones take longer to turn fully tan, but when they do you can be sure that they are ripe. South Anna will avoid the crop failure that can occur in years when DM comes early, and provide higher, better quality yields in years with average DM pressure. Can be planted late, allowing for later harvests that will keep better into the winter and spring. Small (3 g) packet has about 23 seeds."

https://www.southernexposure.com/products/south-anna-butternut-winter-squash/[+https://www.southernexposure.com/products/south-anna-butternut-winter-squash/+]

"South Anna is a new Downy Mildew resistant butternut developed from a cross between Seminole Pumpkin and Waltham butternut. Edmund made the cross in 2011 and has been working on it each year since, intensively selecting for Downy Mildew resistance, productivity, eating quality, brix, dry matter, keeping quality, and butternut shape. This is F8 seed (the eighth generation after the cross). While selection work will continue through 2019 and possibly 2020, the progress made to date is exciting. Expect 95% butternut-shaped fruits, with good productivity, Downy Mildew resistance, rich sweet flavor, and very good keeping quality. Immature fruits vary between light and dark green in color (most immature butternuts are light green). The dark green ones take longer to turn fully tan, but when they do you can be sure that they are ripe.

South Anna will avoid the crop failure that can occur in years when Downy Mildew comes early, and provide higher yields in years with average DM pressure. The healthier foliage also leads to better fruit quality, with sweeter, riper fruits of a rich tan color. When used as a late planting, South Anna grows strong until frost, allowing for later harvests that will keep better into the winter and spring."

Double culture for summer use and long-term (winter) storage."

Squash (Zapallo Plomo)
----------------------

"110 days — The vines grow vigorously and are productive. The fruits can get quite large, up to twenty pounds, have grayish-green skin, and are somewhat flattened in shape with deep ribs. The flesh is a dark, some describe it as "mustard yellow," in color with a mild, sweet flavor. When properly cured, it stores quite well.

Originally introduced to gardeners in 1984 by a seed saver in California named Patricia Black Decima[3] who noted that 'Zapallo Plomo' originated in Argentina.

Its Spanish name, 'Zapallo Plomo', literally translates into English as "Lead Pumpkin." The actual etymology of the word "zapallo" (pronounced zah-pie-oh) is from the Quechuan language[1] from the region of the Andes, and was used to generally describe what we now categorize as Cucurbita maxima or winter squash."

Tomato (Der Kleine Doctor)
--------------------------

"The Little Doctor  is one of several dark cherry tomatoes I have grown to find a replacement for Black Cherry, which just won’t grow for me. I have narrowed down to the two best-tasting and most productive varieties. One was Der Kleine Doctor, and the other was Christmas Purple Grapes. Der Kleine Doctor has the richest, sweetest, most jammy flavor, but Christmas Purple Grapes has greater productivity. I will just have to continue to grow both.

I do not know the history of this one, but I found that it belongs to Aromagärtnerei Deaflora. Der Kleine Doctor produces very large cherries, nearly saladettes, of deep purple (clear epidermis). The flesh is succulent, deeply rich, and very sweet. If overwatered while ripening, I would expect the flavors to be less intense. Now I must make a name clarification. I received this packet of seeds with “Doktor” spelled; however, the kind vendor at Aromagärtnerei Deaflora told me recently that the spelling is with a “c”, as it is named after a person. Unfortunately, my seed packets are all printed with the name under which I received it…”Doktor.”"

Tomato (Early Minsk)
--------------------

"'Minsk Early'. A tomato laden with meaning for me.

Consistently our first tomato, it's a great tomato... for a first tomato. But when other tomatoes start ripening, it's time to move on.

The flavor's acid & sweet, mild but good; the texture great when perfectly ripe, but gets mealy.

This year it's been very productive -- twice the volume of any other -- but with all the rain most are splitting. This fruit managed to be beautiful fresh off the vine, at peak ripeness.

I didn't know it when I requested the variety from the USDA, but a quarter of my ancestors come from Minsk, the capital of Belarus, so this is an ancestral crop for me."

They have an excellent meaty texture and sweet flavor with a nice "tomatoey" finish but not acidic or tart. Thin skin, meaty flesh, seeds and juice in two cells.

'Fioletovyi Kruglyi' translates from Russian into English as "Purple Round". It was sent to us by seed saver, Andrey Baranovski of Minsk (BELR BA A)."

https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato_fioletovyi-kruglyi.html[+https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato_fioletovyi-kruglyi.html+]

"This was an early producer in my garden this summer. Strangely beautiful fruits were a greenish/blackish/purplish color. Borne on trusses of about 4 to 6 fruits, these perfectly round tomatoes just kept pumping out. They have a firm, meaty interior that are in 2 halves or cells. The skin was thin but held up well to handling, making these a market-growers joy. Nice balanced tomato flavor. The nearly unpronounceable name, Fioletovyi Kruglyi, translates from Russian as "Purple Round". That is a pretty apt description, although to me they looked more greenish black in color. These come originally from famous seed saver Andrey Baranovski of Minsk, (now in Belarus). Many of my favorite tomatoes came from him originally such as Orange 1, and Tsygan. You are sure to enjoy this way-easy to grow tomato that beat the heat and drought in this 2012 summer in Amishland. To the best of my knowledge, I am one of only 2 commercial sources of this tomato in the USA."

Tomato (Flamenco)
-----------------

"A little tomato-producing machine, laughing at something as silly as Arizona heat. Flamenco was developed from a cross between Silvery Fir Tree, chosen for earliness and feathery foliage, and Floridade, chosen for heat and disease resistance. Flamenco grows compactly to around 4 feet tall, although not with a dwarf growth habit. The leaves are lovely frilly things. Fruits are cocktail-sized red and round to slightly flattened. The flavor is strong tomatoey but clean, with no musky aftertaste. When sliced, this tomato runs over with juice. Although it was tested with great success in the dry heat both Tucson and Patagonia, Arizona, it also performed well in my heat and humidity in Florida. Not all tomatoes developed for heat tolerance also do well in conditions with nightly 100% humidity, but this one did. Recommended for the south US, from east to west!"

Tomato (Garden Gem)
-------------------

"This cultivar produces massive numbers of delicious oval fruits that average 50 grams (2-2.5 ounces). Taste panels rated it statistically identical to its heirloom parent with twice the yield. It is an early producer, giving ripe fruits about 60-65 days after transplanting. Its size makes it perfect for salads or just popping in your mouth. And it really shines in marinara. The personal chef for the University of Florida, Dean Cacciatore, produced a sauce that blew away high-end $9 a jar commercial sauces in a consumer preference panel. This is truly a versatile tomato. Over the last five years it has consistently been the most popular of our three releases."

"(62 days) Open-pollinated. Rampant Indeterminate. From a selection of F-1 Sunsugar, Rachel and Tevis Robertson-Goldberg of Crabapple Farm in Chesterfield, MA, developed Honeydrop and sent us the original seed, with their blessing to keep the production going. Honeydrop’s sweet juicy fruity honey-colored treats taste almost like white grapes. They are much less prone to cracking in wet weather than Sun Gold. Seeking to add another light-colored cherry to our selection, we trialed it against Blondkopchen, Dr. Carolyn, Isis Candy, Lemondrop and Weissbehart. It bested them all by such a wide margin in earliness, sweetness and complexity that we declined to add any of those others. Parthenocarpic. Still retains a percentage of recessive pink off-types but these are also yummy!"

Tomato (Legend)
---------------

"The late-blight-resistant tomato you've been looking for! Developed by Drs. Jim Myers and Jim Baggett at Oregon State University and released in 2008, 'Legend' is a big, early, productive, great tasting tomato. It would be worth growing even without its resistance to the killer late-blight fungus, simply for being the earliest big slicing tomato out there (fruits can reach 4-5" across). You should note that "resistance" is not the same as "immunity," but growers can expect two or three additional weeks of harvest from their 'Legend' plants beyond when late-blight infestation fully destroys the crops of other tomato varieties. This is also an uncommon "parthenocarpic" tomato variety, meaning it sets seed without fertilization, making it a great tomato for colder areas, where cool nights might otherwise make tomato flowers shrivel."

Aritzkuren – in Euskera, which is the original language of these valleys, means beautiful oak. It is a sparsely populated community (maybe 100 people) and if you google the history, it’s amazing. This is one of their endangered heirlooms given to me by a Spanish grower. The beauty of it is breath-taking. Picture perfect fruits of the black family. The sliced photo is not enhanced in any way. That is the true color you will get. Deep and smokey. Difficult to describe how it tastes other than the common words of sweet and earthy. Very meaty and solid. Big producer for such a large tomato.  This is a collectors dream. I hope to share the seed as much as possible because it is on the endangered list. Perfect example of the need for seed preservation."

Tomato (Nepal)
--------------

"78 days, indeterminate — The regular leaf plants of 'Nepal' produce wonderfully flavored, globe to flattened-globe shaped, ten to twelve ounce, red colored fruit. It is quite productive and a good choice as a main crop, canning or processing tomato.

When he sent 'Nepal' seeds to us in 2004, our friend, author and tomato authority Craig LeHoullier told us, "It is still a favorite of mine." In his 2015 book entitled, "Epic Tomatoes: How To Select and Grow the Best Varieties of All Time," he wrote, "Though nothing special to look at, NEPAL is the tomato that converted me from hybrids to heirloom." He originally purchased the seed in 1986 from Johnny's Selected Seeds, who have carried it off and on since they first introduced it in the mid-1980s. Each packet contains approximately 20 seeds."

https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato_nepal.html[+https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato_nepal.html+]

"78 days. Solanum lycopersicum. Open Pollinated. Plant produces good yields of 10 to 12 oz deep red tomatoes. It has the rich old-fashioned tomato flavor. Perfect for salads, slicing, and sandwiches. It is a great keeper if picked green late in summer and allowed to ripen when wrapped in paper. Does well in cool weather. Plant requires support, either staking or cages. Excellent choice for home gardens. A variety from the Himalaya Mountains, Nepal. United States Department of Agriculture, PI 286426. Indeterminate. Grown Organically."

http://www.reimerseeds.com/nepal-tomato.aspx[+http://www.reimerseeds.com/nepal-tomato.aspx+]

"Nepal was a very pleasant surprise for us producing the earliest and heaviest sets we’ve seen for a tomato of its class and quality. Nearly beefsteak sized 1/2lb fruits hung in abundance and delivered the seasons first glimpse of that ripe complexity of flavor we celebrate during the main-season tomato time. Hailing from the Northern Indian Himalayas, Nepal is a fantastic early-midseason slicer, with sturdy, strong vines, crack-resistant fruit, and heavy set for its size. Also very good for ripening off the vine come fall."

In our 2008 grow out, 'Précocibec' was our best producer. Very early, heavy yields. It is a good choice for home food production as a canning tomato.

Bred by Roger Doucet who was in charge of the tomato breeding program at Station Provinciale de Recherches Agricole, St. Hyacinthe, Quebec in the 1960s and 1970s. Released in 1974. USDA accession number PI 6472013."

https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato_precocibec.html[+https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato_precocibec.html+]

"Bred in Quebec, this is a heavy-producing variety that ripens relatively early, after about ten weeks. Ideal for northern climates because it tolerates cool spring nights, down to 4°C. Medium-sized red fruit are ideal for home canning. Precocibec is a ‘determinate’ tomato: it ripens all at once, and terminates its stem growth, and so is ideal for growing in small spaces. Expect about 2 feet in height. Open-pollinating, it requires direct sunlight. Also known as Doucet’s Quebec Early Market."

"This delicious tomato — our favorite for taste two years in a row — was collected by the USDA in 1976 along a road near the village of Puerto Cortes, about 20 miles outside San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras (and presently one of the most violent cities in the world, best known in the United States as the starting point for a famous migrant caravan). The fruit are not uniform — indicative of its semi-wild origins — ranging from round to somewhat flat, rarely larger than an inch and a half in diameter. The taste is a perfect blend of sweet and sour. We first grew this tomato to honor the resilient people of the San Pedro Sula region, which has been gravely affected by drug trafficking violence, corporate corruption, and political oppression. We were pleasantly surprised to find a real gem in this tomato. Very productive."

"Tomatoes across the Americas are known as "Riñon", which means kidney, but the earliest in the USDA's collection came from Cuba in 1932. Already less than uniform when it was collected from the wild in Cuba (according to the original notes), nearly a century in the USDA's collection seems to have made the government's variety even more variable. When we first grew it out, we found at least a dozen different types, ranging in size, shape, flavor, color, and vigor. With a little selection, we've basically stabilized this wonderful little tomato from the 'Riñon' genepool: a reddish-pink, flat, fasciated (deeply ribbed), flavorful and incredibly productive tomato."

Tomato (Tasmanian Chocolate)
----------------------------

"85 days, dwarf — The plants of 'Tasmanian Chocolate' have dark green, regular leaf,  rugose foliage, stout central stems, and grows to three to four feet in height. Perfect for a large pot or garden. The fruits are oblate, ranging from five to twelve ounces, and ripen to a deep mahogany color. Flavor is full, balanced and delicious.

'Tasmanian Chocolate' originated from a cross between 'New Big Dwarf' (an historic large fruited pink dwarf) and 'Paul Robeson', made in 2006 by Patrina Nuske Small in Australia. The variety was further selected and named by Linda Reid of Tasmania. Now past its ninth generation, it is a quite stable open-pollinated variety but still may produce the occasional off-type plant.

Others involved in its development were Craig LeHoullier, Lee Newman, Greg Fee, Michael Volk, Tim McElroy, Howard Kushner, Paul Fish and Bill Minkey. This was a Victory Seed Company introduction for 2011 and one of the first introductions from the Dwarf Tomato Project."

Tomato (Ted's Pink Currant)
---------------------------

"76 days, indeterminate — Although red-colored currant tomatoes have been available for many years, pink-fruited currants are fairly rare. 'Ted's Pink Currant' currant abundantly supplies fruits that are about one-half inch in diameter, sweet and mild, that are a beautiful pink color.

In general, currant tomatoes are very productive, very hardy, start producing early and continue until freezing temperatures arrive in the fall. They have a sprawling growth habit that is not easily tamed by tomato baskets nor by using the Florida weave method. Either leave them to their wild, rambling habit, or allow them to climb a lattice of livestock panel.

We received 'Ted's Pink Currant' from our friend, the late Dr. Carolyn Male. She originally had received seeds from Ted Darnowski of Florida and introduced it to seed savers in 2013. Each packet contains approximately 20 seeds.

Note: Although these are a different species from garden tomatoes, they will readily cross with other tomatoes. If you are saving seed, isolate these plants."

https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato-teds-pink-currant.html[+https://www.victoryseeds.com/tomato-teds-pink-currant.html+]

"This is probably the only known pink currant tomato variety. Introduced commercially by Tatiana’s TOMATObase Seeds in 2016. Indeterminate, regular leaf plants produce a high yield of very small pink currant-size fruits with an excellent sweet/acidic flavor."

Tomato (Turnip)

They named it Turnip because it reminded them of a Turnip in shape. Very large, deep red fat monster tomatoes. Big heart to blunt heart shape. Lots of meat and very little gel. This is a great saucer. Rich and sweet. Some can reach close to 2 lbs.  Indeterminate.  Mid-late season.  Regular leaf wispy."
