Agastache canna (Texas hummingbird mint)
----------------------------------------

*Other names*: hummingbird mint, mosquito plant, double bubble mint

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agastache_cana[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agastache_cana+]

=====
A hardy perennial belonging to the genus Agastache (pronounced ag-uh-STAH-kee). The genus name Agastache is derived from the Greek word meaning "a lot of", and stachy, meaning "spike", which refers to the flower's 12 terminal spikes that decorate the plant. These spikes remain through the growing season from early summer to late fall.[1] The Mosquito Plant is native to New Mexico and western Texas, where it grows in mountainous areas at altitudes of 6,000 feet.

Individuals of this species grow to an average height of 3 feet by 2 feet wide in a shrub habit. It is an erect perennial species with ovate leaves, semi-woody structure, and profuse branching.
The flowers are hermaphroditic, which means the flower contains both male and female parts.[4] A. cana is a prolific organism, which means it actively reproduces all growing season. It begins to blossom in early June and continues to bloom until late September.

This species needs good drainage in order to avoid over growth of mold and mildew in the soil.It needs medium amounts of water to sustain itself. A. cana is a drought tolerant organism and can endure cold temperatures up to -20 ̊F.[3] A. cana thrives in contained areas and herb gardens. It is an attractant of bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Butterflies are essentially drawn in by the scent of the flowers, while hummingbirds are attracted to the sweet nectar and tubular-shaped blossoms of bright reds or purples.

The mosquito plant has obtained recognition for attracting broad-tailed hummingbirds that are used for migration pattern studies. It is also known to be an herb that is edible. Dried petals of the flower and leaves can be used in tea. This species is used for ornamental purposes for many rock garden homes in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Most importantly, A. cana is known for being a natural mosquito repellent. This mint family member has a highly flavored oil that minimizes contact with many flying insects, including mosquitos. It works in the same way as the citronella-geranium hybrid plant.[7] In order to release the mosquito-repelling odor, the plant needs to be crushed and rubbed unto surfaces. Many people apply the contents of the crushed plant directly to their skin. When A. cana is brought together with larval control and mosquito breeding sites, it can effectively decrease the mosquito population in a given area.

Amorpha fruticosa (Desert Indigo)
---------------------------------

*Other names:*  Indigo bush, False indigo bush, False indigo, Desert false indigo

http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=AMFR[+http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=AMFR+]

=====
False indigo-bush is a 6-10 ft., loose, airy shrub which often forms dense thickets. Plants develop a leggy character with the majority of their pinnately compound, fine-textured foliage on the upper third of the plant. Leaflets velvety on the lower surface, margins frequently almost parallel, often abruptly rounded at both ends and with a notch at the tip. Flowers small, purple to dark blue with yellow stamens extending beyond the single petal, crowded in narrow, 3-6 in., spikelike clusters at or near the ends of the branchlets, appearing from April to June. Fruit small, up to 3/8 inch long and with blisterlike glands visible under a 10x hand lens. This is a deciduous plant.

This shrub, which often forms thickets on riverbanks and islands, can be weedy or invasive in the northeast. Another False Indigo (A. herbacea) has whitish to blue-violet flowers in fan-like masses on top of the plant and gray-downy foliage with up to 40 leaflets. The genus name, from the Greek amorphos (formless or deformed), alludes to the fact that the flower, with only a single petal (the banner or standard), is unlike the typical pea flowers of the family.

Angelica keiskei koidzumi (Ashitaba)
------------------------------------

*Other names*: Ashitaba

https://www.strictlymedicinalseeds.com/product.asp?specific=1302[+https://www.strictlymedicinalseeds.com/product.asp?specific=1302+]

=====
Rare. Native to Hachijojima Island in Japan. The nutritional and health benefits of this high chlorophyll plant are extensive, and ashitaba is unique among the Angelicas due to its tasty edibility and the presence of substantial levels of B12, a vitamin normally not found in terrestrial plants. The plant contains flavonoids known as "chalcones" in its yellow sap. Traditionally, the herb has been used as a rejuvenating food that contributes to long life. Eat the fresh stems of the leaves and dry the leaves and make tea. It is called "tomorrow's leaf" because when harvesting one leaf from the plant, you can expect to see a new one "tomorrow."  The plant does indeed rejuvenate itself very quickly, in much the same way as it rejuvenates the human digestion and skin.  The herb is considered effective in treating eczema and psoriasis, also disorders of the gastrointestinal system, hepatitis, cancer, anemia, chronic fatigue, etc. In-vivo tests of chalcones have shown strong antibiotic activity against staphylococcus.

Soak seeds overnight in cool, non-chlorinated water and then refrigerate the seeds (approximately 40 degrees F) in moist medium for 30 days.  The moist medium could be moist sand, moist potting soil, moist coir or moist peat.  Note that our recommendation is MOIST not SODDEN or VERY WET, and that we are recommending REFRIGERATION not FREEZING.  After this pretreatment, plant the (still moist) seeds.  Sow on surface, barely cover with soil and press in firmly and keep evenly moist until germination.  Use a greenhouse, shadehouse or grow lights.  Germination occurrs 15 days after sowing.   Seedlings are slow-growing and will require about 60 days to transplant.  Once past the seedling stage, the plant is fast growing. The plants prefer rich, deep, evermoist, well-drained soil and full sun to part shade.  Water every other day.  If you are in Arizona, give shade.  If you are in Coastal Maine, give sun. The flowering cycle is biennial and the plants are monocarpic. 

The plants are slow growing at first but once they attain the size of your hand, more or less, they grow very quickly.  Mature size is about 4 feet wide and flowering to about 5 feet tall.  The plant requires warm temperatures for optimal growth--75 to 85 degrees F.  They need at leadst 6 hours sunlight daily to thrive!  It is often best to greenhouse them, although coastal climates (such as San Francisco area) seem to work pretty well for outdoor cultivation, and zone 8 growers may find that these plants do fine in regular open garden conditions (Southern California, Florida, Gulf Coast, Etc).  We have our's in a large tortuga of layered compost, coir and sand, inside the greenhouse (one layer of plastic) which effectively converts our zone 7 into a zone 8.  In other words, keep them in the light, in deep, composty soil, warm and regularly watered, well ventilated, and full of prayers and you will be well rewarded!  You can fertilize by side dressing with organic compost every 3 weeks.  You can pot them up first to gallons, then to 3 gallons, but the more composty soil your plant has, the bigger and healthier it will get.

Annona cherimola (Cherimoya)
----------------------------

*Other names*: Chirimuya, Cherimoya, Chirimoyo, Momoma, Kelemoio

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/cherimoya.html[+https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/cherimoya.html+]

=====
Certainly the most esteemed of the fruits of the genus Annona (family Annonaceae), the cherimoya, A. cherimola Mill., because of its limited distribution, has acquired few colloquial names, and most are merely local variations in spelling, such as chirimoya, cherimolia, chirimolla, cherimolier, cherimoyer. In Venezuela, it is called chirimorrinon; in Brazil, graveola, graviola, or grabiola; and in Mexico, pox or poox; in Belize, tukib; in El Salvador it is sometimes known as anona poshte; and elsewhere merely as anona, or anona blanca. In France, it is anone; in Haiti, cachiman la Chine. Indian names in Guatemala include pac, pap, tsummy and tzumux. The name, cherimoya, is sometimes misapplied to the less-esteemed custard apple, A. reticulata L. In Australia it is often applied to the atemoya (a cherimoya-sugar apple hybrid).

The tree is erect but low branched and somewhat shrubby or spreading; ranging from 16 to 30 ft (5 to 9 m) in height; and its young branchlets are rusty-hairy.
Fragrant flowers, solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, on short, hairy stalks along the branches, have 3 outer, greenish, fleshy, oblong, downy petals to 1 1/4 in (3 cm) long and 3 smaller, pinkish inner petals. A compound fruit, the cherimoya is conical or somewhat heart-shaped, 4 to 8 in (10 to 20 cm) long and up to 4 in (10 cm) in width, weighing on the average 5 1/2 to 18 oz (150-500 g) but extra large specimens may weigh 6 lbs (2.7 kg) or more. The skin, thin or thick, may be smooth with fingerprint like markings or covered with conical or rounded protuberances. The fruit is easily broken or cut open, exposing the snow-white, juicy flesh, of pleasing aroma and delicious, subacid flavor; and containing numerous hard, brown or black, beanlike, glossy seeds, 1/2 to 3/4 in (1.25 to 2 cm) long.

The cherimoya is believed indigenous to the interandean valleys of Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia. In Bolivia, it flourishes best around Mizque and Ayopaya, in the Department of Cochabamba, and around Luribay, Sapahaqui and Rio Abajo in the Department of La Paz. Its cultivation must have spread in ancient times to Chile and Brazil for it has become naturalized in highlands throughout these countries. Many authors include Peru as a center of origin but others assert that the fruit was unknown in Peru until after seeds were sent by P. Bernabe Cobo from Guatemala in 1629 and that thirteen years after this introduction the cherimoya was observed in cultivation and sold in the markets of Lima. The often-cited representations of the cherimoya on ancient Peruvian pottery are actually images of the soursop, A. muricata L. Cobo sent seeds to Mexico also in 1629. There it thrives between 4,000 and 5,000 ft (1312-1640 m) elevations.

The cherimoya is subtropical or mild-temperate and does not succeed in the lowland tropics. It requires long days. In Colombia and Ecuador, it grows naturally at elevations between 4,600 and 6,600 ft (1,400-2,000 m) where the temperature ranges between 62.6° and 68°F (17°-20°C). In Peru, the ideal climate for the cherimoya is said to lie between 64.5° and 77°F (18°-25°C) in the summer and 64.5° and 41°F (18°-5°C) in winter. In Guatemala, naturalized trees are common between 4,000 and 8,200 ft (1,200-2,500 m) though the tree produces best between 4,000 and 5,900 ft (1,200-1,800 m) and can be grown at elevations as low as 2,950 ft (900 m). The tree cannot survive the cold in the Valle de Mexico at 7,200 ft (2,195 m). In Argentina, young trees are wrapped with dry grass or burlap during the winter. The cherimoya can tolerate light frosts. Young trees can withstand a temperature of 26°F (-3.33°C), but a few degrees lower will severely injure or kill mature trees. In February 1949, a small scale commercial grower (B. E. Needham) in Glendora, California, reported that most of his crop was lost because of frost and snow, the cherimoya suffering more cold damage than his avocados, oranges or lemons.

Annona squamosa (sugar apple)
-----------------------------

*Other names:* sugar apple

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annona_squamosa[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annona_squamosa+]

=====
Annona squamosa is a small, well-branched tree or shrub[6] from the family Annonaceae that bears edible fruits called sugar-apples. It tolerates a tropical lowland climate better than its relatives Annona reticulata and Annona cherimola[5] (whose fruits often share the same name)[2] helping make it the most widely cultivated of these species.

A small, semi-(or late) deciduous,[8] much branched shrub or small tree 3 metres (9.8 ft)[6] to 8 metres (26 ft) tall[8] very similar to soursop (Annona muricata)[9] with a broad, open crown or irregularly spreading branches[5] and a short trunk short, not buttressed at base.[8] The fruit of A. squamosa (sugar-apple) has delicious whitish pulp, and is popular in tropical markets.

Annona squamosa is native to the tropical Americas and West Indies, but the exact origin is unknown. It is now the most widely cultivated of all the species of Annona, being grown for its fruit throughout the tropics and warmer subtropics, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan; it was introduced to southern Asia before 1590. It is naturalized as far north as southern Florida in the United States and as south as Bahia in Brazil, and is an invasive species in some areas.

=====
This shrub or small tree can grow up to about 6 m high. It is of narrowly spreading habit, and is openly branched. It is an Australian native, and was a common plant in coastal rain forest that grows right down to the beach, the best plants growing close to the watercourses. 

The leaves are large, opposite, dark green and glossy. In spring, clusters of highly perfumed small, white, tubular flowers are produced along the stems. These are star-shaped with 5 white to cream petals. These are followed by large yellow fruit, up to about 10 cm in diameter, that look rather like apples, and are edible when soft.

Banisteriopsis caapi (Ayahuasca)
--------------------------------

*Other names:* Ayahuasca

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi+]

=====
Banisteriopsis caapi, also known as ayahuasca, caapi or yagé, is a South American liana of the family Malpighiaceae. It is used to prepare ayahuasca, a decoction with a long history of entheogenic uses as a medicine and "plant teacher" among the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Rainforest. It contains harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine, all of which are both beta-carboline harmala alkaloids and MAOIs. The MAOIs in B. caapi allow the primary psychoactive compound, DMT (which is introduced from the other primary ingredient in ayahausca, the Psychotria viridis plant), to be orally active. The stems contain 0.11-0.83% beta-carbolines, with harmine and tetrahydroharmine as the major components.[2] Alkaloids are present in all parts of the plant.[3]

The name ayahuasca means "vine of the soul" in Quechuan, and the shamans of the indigenous western Amazonian tribes use the plant in religious and healing ceremonies. In addition to its hypnotic effect, caapi is used for its healing properties as a purgative, effectively cleansing the body of parasites and helping the digestive tract.

*Other names*: Anacacho orchid tree, Anacacho bauhinia, Orchid tree, Texas plume

http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=BALU[+http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=BALU+]

=====
Native only to a few canyons in western central Texas and in adjacent northeastern Mexico, Anacacho orchid tree is a 6-12 ft., single- or multi-trunked shrub or small tree with small, light green, deeply cleft leaves. Delicate white to pale pink, orchid-like flowers with extended stamens appear prolifically in clusters. Fruit is a flattened pod.

Anacacho orchid tree makes a gorgeous display with its silvery gray bark and fragrant white flowers that resemble orchids. It is a relatively rapid-growing tree after its first year when placed in a favorable location, but should be planted on the south side of buildings in areas with harsh winters. The nectar attracts butterflies and bees.

Benincasa hispida (winter melon)
--------------------------------

*Other names*: winter melon, ash gourd, white gourd, winter gourd, tallow gourd, Chinese preserving melon

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_melon[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_melon+]

=====
The winter melon is a vine grown for its very large fruit, eaten as a vegetable when mature.
It is the only member of the genus Benincasa. The fruit is fuzzy when young. The immature melon has thick white flesh that is sweet when eaten. By maturity, the fruit loses its hairs and develops a waxy coating, giving rise to the name wax gourd, and providing a long shelf life. The melon may grow as large as 80 cm in length. Although the fruit is referred to as a "melon," the fully grown crop is not sweet. Native to South Asia and Southeast Asia, the winter melon is widely grown throughout Asia.

Bixa orellana (Achiote)
-----------------------

*Other names:* achiote, lipstick tree, annatto tree

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixa_orellana[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixa_orellana+]

=====
Achiote (Bixa orellana) is a shrub or small tree originating from the tropical region of the Americas. North, Central and South American natives originally used the seeds to make red body paint and lipstick. For this reason, the achiote is sometimes called the lipstick tree.

The tree is best known as the source of annatto, a natural orange-red condiment (also called "achiote" or "bijol") obtained from the waxy arils that cover its seeds. The ground seeds are widely used in traditional dishes in South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico; such as cochinita pibil, chicken in achiote and caldo de olla. Annatto and its extracts are also used as an industrial food coloring to add yellow or orange color to many products such as butter, cheese, sausages, cakes, and popcorn.

=====
Perfect for the homesteader, gardeners of small spaces, and farmers alike! This is a grex (interbreeding mix) of Purple Tree Collards and Daubenton crossed to a variety of other kales, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, Redbor kale, and other perennial kales collected around the Pacific Northwest. The blending of these varieties has resulted in a huge diversity of leaf shapes from long and thin to ruffled or flat, colors ranging from yellow green, red, dark purple, variegated white, and solid green. A variety of plant architectures from extremely tall tree cabbage or palm kale types to bushy plants with many branching stems. However, nearly all plants are perennial and with great flavor passing down nicely from the exceptional epicurean parent varieties of this mix. In taste tests, this kale collards mix has been consistently enjoyed and savored by several chefs, farmers market customers, and CSA share customers alike. The greatest part about all this is that you can easily keep in production and renew the best perennials indefinitely by taking cuttings of second year stems and burying them in rows in fall or late winter. I'll write more about this later. 

The initial cross was part chance luck and forethought of my friend Graham from Wales. He was generous enough to send me some initial precious seed. Since then this genepool has undergone a selection for perenniality, bushing habit, winter hardiness, aphid resistance, and against various undesirable plant characteristics. Seed like this is simply unavailable anywhere else. I am releasing this unstable seed as a breeders mix for those wishing to select their own unique perennial kales. Furthermore, in the collaborative spirit of the small community working with perennial kales, this seed is being released under the OSSI license to protect this important genetic material from large multi-national seed conglomerates that might seek to patent or otherwise control it.

=====
Look how the water droplets dance amongst the ruffles of the leaves. Hailing from Victorian Era in France, this kale was known to grow as tall as a horses back. Leaves vary in purple coloration and are slightly ruffled. Plants have a tendency to branch slightly. Flourishes all year long, but shines as a winter kale when other kale has turned to frosted mush, overwinters well even in the southern Canada. This is not a Red Russian kale (Brassica napus) but a true collard kale (Brassica oleracea) with much finer texture and delectable sweetness all winter long. Surviving open pollinated acephala kales, those which are reddish purple in the leaf and stem, have become quite rare. Like many of the older kales, this variety possesses some perennial regrowth after flowering often living to flower a second round.

=====
When we arrived in Elmer, NJ and camped out in a field to start the EFN flagship farm in early 2014, the Deitrichs told us we should start picking and eating the "wild broccoli raab" that abounds in the area. We were soon hooked, eating it daily raw or cooked (it's especially good in scrambled eggs or just sauteed in some olive oil) as long as it was available. Even when it's not sending up its cut-and-come-again flower spikes, the leaves are great cooking greens. We assume it's a feral leaf turnip escaped from some erstwhile Italian farmers in the neighborhood. Thanks to the Deitrich's wise stewardship of their land -- eschewing herbicides and leaving lots of land unmowed -- and love for this plant in particular, a strong population thrives in their corner of southern New Jersey. We've selected seeds from the most productive, earliest plants in an effort to re-domesticate it with all of its best wild properties intact. That process will continue, but for now we're happy to offer you this gem.

Caragana arborescens (Siberian pea tree)
----------------------------------------

*Other names:* Siberian pea tree

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caragana_arborescens[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caragana_arborescens+]

=====
Caragana arborescens, the Siberian peashrub,[1] Siberian pea-tree,[2] or caragana, is a species of legume native to Siberia and parts of China (Heilongjiang Xinjiang) and neighboring Mongolia and Kazakhstan.[3] It was taken to the United States by Eurasian immigrants, who used it as a food source while travelling west. In some areas of the United States it is considered an invasive species.

It is a perennial shrub or small tree up to 2–6 m (6 ft 7 in–19 ft 8 in) tall.[3] Typically, it has a moderate to fast growth rate, being able to grow one to three feet during the first year after trimming.

Caragana arborescens can be grown as an ornamental plant and bonsai. It has an extensive root system, and can be used in erosion control. The fragrant flowers attract bees.
The seeds are edible, but should be cooked before being eaten. There have been no verified cases of poisoning from consuming the seeds.[citation needed] The flowers are also edible, and can be used in salads.
It is recommended for planting in the outer rows of multi-row plantings. It can be used to neutralize soil to prepare for further planting. A legume, C. arborescens fixes nitrogen. It is suitable for planting in single-row field windbreaks where a dense, short barrier is desired.
It is used for nesting by several songbirds. The seeds are occasionally eaten by a few songbirds. The plant is not a preferred food for browsing animals, but its fragrant flowers attract many pollen-consuming animals.

Carissa grandiflora (natal plum)
--------------------------------

*Other names:*  natal plum

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carissa_macrocarpa[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carissa_macrocarpa+]

=====
Carissa macrocarpa (Natal Plum), is a shrub native to South Africa, where it is commonly called the Large Num-Num. In Zulu, as well as in the Bantu tribes of Uganda, it is called Amathungulu or umThungulu oBomvu. In Afrikaans the fruit is called Noem-Noem.

It deals well with salt-laden winds, making it a good choice for coastal areas. It is commonly found in the coastal bush of the Eastern Cape and Natal.[1] It produces shiny, deep green leaves and snowy white flowers whose perfumed scent intensifies at night. Like other Carissa species, C. macrocarpa is a spiny, evergreen shrub containing latex. They bloom for months at a time. The ornamental plump, round, crimson fruit appears in summer and fall (autumn) at the same time as the blooms. In moderate, coastal areas the fruits appear through the year. The fruit can be eaten out of hand or made into pies, jams, jellies, and sauces.[1] Some claim that other than the fruit, the plant is poisonous.[2] However this claim is a myth, possibly based on similarities to other plants with milky sap.

Casimiroa edulis (white sapote)
-------------------------------

*Other names*: casimiroa, white sapote, Mexican apple

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/white_sapote.html[+https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/white_sapote.html+]

=====
White sapote trees range from 15 to 20 ft (4.5-6 m) up to 30 to 60 ft (9-18 m) in height. They have light-gray, thick, warty bark and often develop long, drooping branches. The leaves, mostly evergreen are alternate, palmately compound, with 3 to 7 lanceolate leaflets, smooth or hairy on the underside. The odorless flowers, small and greenish-yellow, are 4- or 5-parted, and borne in terminal and axillary panicles. They are hermaphrodite or occasionally unisexual because of aborted stigmas.

The fruit is round, oval or ovoid, symmetrical or irregular, more or less distinctly 5-lobed; 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 in (6.25-11.25 cm) wide and up to 4 3/4 in (12 cm) in length; with thin green, yellowish or golden skin coated with a very thin bloom, tender but inedible; and creamy-white or yellow flesh glinting with many tiny, conspicuous, yellow oil glands. The flavor is sweet with a hint or more of bitterness and sometimes distinctly resinous. There may be 1 to 6 plump, oval, hard, white seeds, 1 to 2 in (2.5-5 cm) long and 1/2 to 1 in (1.25-2.5 cm) thick, but often some seeds are under-developed (aborted) and very thin. The kernels are bitter and narcotic.

The common white sapote occurs both wild and cultivated in central Mexico. It is planted frequently in Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica and is occasionally grown in northern South America, the Bahamas, West Indies, along the Riviera and other parts of the Mediterranean region, India and the East Indies. It is grown commercially in the Gisborne district of New Zealand and to some extent in South Africa. Horticulturists in Israel took serious interest in white sapotes around 1935 and planted a number of varieties. The trees grew well and produced little in the coastal plain; bore good crops in the interior and commercial prospects seemed bright but the fruit did not appeal to consumers and was too attractive to fruit flies. White sapotes have not done well in the Philippines. The common species was introduced into California by Franciscan monks about 1810, and it is still cultivated on a limited scale in the southern part of that state. In Florida, it was first planted with enthusiasm. Today it is seldom seen outside of fruit tree collections. Of course, many of the trees planted have been seedlings bearing fruits of inferior size and quality, but even the best have never attained popularity in this country.

Within its native range, the white sapote is commonly eaten out-of-hand. The flesh of ripe fruits may be added to fruit cups and salads or served alone as dessert, but it is best cut into sections and served with cream and sugar. Sometimes it is added to ice cream mix or milk shakes, or made into marmalade. Even in their countries of origin, where the fruits may at times appear in markets, their repute is due largely to a belief in their therapeutic value, while, at the same time, there prevails a fear that over-indulgence may be harmful. The epithet "matasano" (interpreted as "kill health") has a sinister connotation. Dr. J.B. Londoño, in his Frutas de Antioquia, published in Medellin, Colombia, in 1934, referred to the white sapote as disagreeable and indigestible. Some years ago in Central America there were unsuccessful efforts to manufacture from the pulp an acceptable preserve. In processing trials at the Western Regional Research Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, California, technologists decided that white sapotes; are not suitable for either canning in sirup or freezing as a puree.

Crotalaria spectabilis (loco weed)

=====
Crotolaria spectabilis is in the Fabaceae (Leguminosae) family and originates from India and Asia. As the species epithet implies this is one spectacularly gorgeous annual. Even though it is an annual it will readily self seed and form large patches which return year after year. It is a fast grower and a profuse bloomer. It grows from 1-3 feet tall with large, leathery leaves that resemble no other legume I can think of. They look more like tobacco leaves! Above the leaves the plant sends up tall spikes with purplish stems which bloom in progression as they grow. This plant is in bloom from mid Summer until frost and really puts on a dazzling display with its large yellow flowers. After the flowers the equally ornamental pods form. The inflated pods are lime green and dangle like ornaments on a Christmas tree. They have a prominent dark stripe along their length. When the pods ripen the seeds fall loose inside and rattle in the slightest breeze. This plant is drought tolerant to the max and also grows extremely well in the poorest of soils. The plant is hardy and self seeding well into zone 5! Behind all of the beauty of this species lies its dirty little secret. It is rather toxic and is the cause of livestock "dumbing disease". It makes animals that feed on it behave as if drunk; hence the common name of Loco Weed! This is due to the potent alkaloids contained in all parts of the plant especially the seeds. I have yet to see any plants that have been foraged. Even our voracious deer avoid this one so I suspect there's not much to worry about unless you have goats. The alkaloids have several medicinal uses, but due to negative reactions are not used often. This species is an excellent nitrogen fixer and green manure/cover crop. It is a true soil building pioneer of waste areas and can put literally tons of Nitrogen per acre back into the soil.

Crotolaria longirostrata (Chipilín)

=====
Chipilin (Crotolaria longirostrata) is a Mesoamerican nitrogen-fixing shrub. The cooked leaves are a popular vegetable. They have a remarkable 38% protein dry weight and can produce 5-11 tons per hectare dry weight. Chipilin grows in semi-arid to humid tropics and subtropics, including highlands. This species should be much more widely grown.
=====

http://worldcrops.org/crops/chipilin[+http://worldcrops.org/crops/chipilin+]

=====
A leguminous plant originally from Central America and Southern Mexico that is a popular crop in the cuisines of El Salvador, Guatemala and parts of Southern Mexico. Chipilín is an annual slender shrub that will sometimes persist for more than a year. It grows upright to 2 – 6 feet high, with slender, vertical or arching branches, nearly cylindrical, and slightly hairy. The stem often turns dark-red as it matures. Chipilín is sensitive to cool weather and will die-back with a light frost.

Chipilin has been considered as one of the 16 most important species of edible leaves in the world (Arias, et al., 2003) due its high content in calcium, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid (Morton, 1994) and as a valuable source of protein (Arias, et al., l 2003).

=====
Chipilín is native to El Salvador and is a staple in the Salvadoran diet and popular among Guatemalans and people from southern Mexico. This green leafy vegetable is not cultivated on an agricultural scale; it’s something you might find at farmers’ markets. Chemical analyses show that the foliage is rich in calcium and iron. We must be careful of the seeds and roots since they are undeniably toxic. Introduced populations of this perennial legume exist on the island of Maui in Hawaii. In Australia importation has been banned because it is an invasive plant that disrupt and take over natural habitats. Other common names of plants that fall under this genus are longbeak rattlebox and chipilin. The name rattlebox comes from the fact that as the heart-shaped seeds mature, these seeds detach, become loose in the pod, and produce a rattling sound when shaken. Derived from the Greek word crotalus, the name of the genus also means castanet.

The chipilín (Crotalaria longirostrata) is a tropical legume domesticated since pre-Hispanic times maintaining the anthropocentric characteristics reported for other plants of the country. It covers a wide range of uses such as: food and refreshing drink for humans, cover crop or green manure (by fixing atmospheric nitrogen), improvement of fallows, paper elaboration, medicinal plant and melliferous species. An alternate possibility for its use would be as forage for animal feeding, as has been reported in Mexico and other countries. Notwithstanding that Crotalaria longirostrata is considered at world level as one of the 16 most important species of edible leaf, literature reports on it’s chemical composition and/or its nutritional value in Mexico are scarce. The present study describes the nutritional value of the plant evaluated by means of its chemical composition and in vitro digestibility.
Anyhow, Chipilin leaves can be boiled much like Pak Choy or Spinach. But much more common is the incorporation of finely chopped leaves into tamales, pupusas, soups, or sauces. You can used it in sautéed, or dried for seasoning. My Grandma would only use it for chipilin rice soup twice a week, (a good source of iron and calcium for her grandchildren) this soup is traditionally made with chicken or pork with rice, carrots, chayote, potatoes , green beans and aromatic spices that required a long, gentle simmering. As for me, my favorite was cream of corn with these edible flowers. This vegetable is hard to find here in the USA. Though, frozen products are an alternative for creating Central American dishes.

=====
This curious melon, also known as Garden Lemon, is by far the most productive melon we have grown to date. 15 plants produced about 200 3 to 4 inch long yellow fruits. While fragrant like a true melon, the flesh resembles a pear in texture and flavor, and thus can be used like pears in recipes, especially salads. Victorians grew this melon as a novelty on trellises and arches, so it can be trained up fences to save space. We found it especially well adapted to Southeast Asian cookery and makes excellent chutney and curry. The green melons are perfect when stuffed with spices and pickled.
=====

Cucumis metuliferus (African horned cucumber)
---------------------------------------------

*Other names*:  horned melon, kiwano, jelly melon, hedged gourd, melano, blowfish fruit

=====
This African climber is cultivated in various parts of the world for its showy, edible fruits.
Cucumis metuliferus is an annual climbing or rarely trailing herb; vegetative parts rough with spreading hairs. Stems are up to 3 m long, radiating from a woody rootstock. The leaves are broadly ovate-cordate in outline, up to 90 x 100 mm, unlobed or usually palmately 3–5-lobed, veins below very roughly hairy, margins minutely toothed; leaf stalks (petioles) up to 100 mm long. Both male and female flowers appear on the same plant (monoecious). Male flowers are solitary or up to 4 in sessile or short-stalked groups, greenish to light yellow, the corolla is 5–10 mm long. Female flowers are solitary on 20–60 mm long stalks; the ovary is up to 20 mm long, pale green with numerous minute, dark green fleshy spines, the corolla is yellow, 8–15 mm long. The fruit is ellipsoid-cylindrical, obscurely trigonous (triangular in shape), 60–150 mm long, 30–60 mm across when ripe, the scattered spines are rather stout, fleshy, ± 10 x 2–5 mm, broad-based, deep green-grey, ripening yellow to orange-red with obscure longitudinal stripes of small pale markings and rather softly fleshy. Seeds are ellipsoid, flattened, 6–9 mm long, numerous, embedded in a light green or emerald-green, jelly-like flesh.

Culinary uses: the fruit needs to be carefully handled because of the sharp spines on the skin. As is the case in C. africanus (March 2005 in this series), the fruits of C. metuliferus occur in very bitter forms, grading to non-bitter forms. The bitter forms are unpalatable and probably poisonous, but there is no way of distinguishing between them except by tasting. The taste of the non-bitter forms has been described as flavourless or rather bland pineapple-banana-like or even ± sour. Some observers noted that the fruit can be eaten like an ordinary cucumber, while Parsley (1981) suggests that the refreshing jelly is best scooped out of the shell with a spoon or used in fruit salad. A jelly can be made from the fruit by boiling it until soft, straining it and boiling the fruit pulp again with a cup of sugar for each cup of water. The fruit can also be cut into cubes and pickled in vinegar. 

Medicinal and spiritual uses and toxicity: the jelly melon contains saponin, a substance which is often toxic, but which contains many medicinal properties. Saponin is a kind of oily glycoside that foams freely when shaken with water. Roodt (1998) reports that in the Okavango area, the Shona tribe use a decoction of the root for relief of pain after childbirth. It is also alleged that the boiled root is a very good gonorrhoea cure. Only the bitter forms of the fruit are toxic. According to Roodt, the toxicity can usually be neutralized by cooking the fruits. Elderly persons in the Okavango believe that one can prevent ghosts or evil spirits from entering one's house by pounding the roots, mixing them with fat and smearing them onto the body.

Quite a few seed companies are now selling this unique melon and cucumber relative (known variously as "Kiwano," "African Horned Melon," "Jelly Melon," and more), but most varieties fail to ripen in the northern parts of the US. We got these seeds from the USDA, which got them from the Vavilov Institute in then-Leningrad in 1986, which in turn received them from the Netherlands. We believe this unique provenance explains why this strain ripens so early. It can be grown up a trellis or allowed to sprawl. A healthy, delicious, beautiful fruit, Kiwano is great in smoothies, ice-cream, or for fresh eating. Everyone should try growing this crop at least once. And if you've already tried and failed, give our strain a go.

Cucurbita foetidissima is a tuberous xerophytic plant found in the central and southwestern United States and northern Mexico.[3] It has numerous common names, including: buffalo gourd,[1] calabazilla,[1] chilicote, coyote gourd, fetid gourd, fetid wild pumpkin,[1] Missouri gourd,[1] prairie gourd,[4] stinking gourd, wild gourd,[1] and wild pumpkin.

=====
Buffalo gourd is a perennial that grows from a large tuberous root. It produces very long stems that trail along the ground for several yards, along which small, round gourds form. The roots, stems, and leaves were used for a variety of medicinal needs and the seeds were eaten.

The large, roughly triangular leaves of this plant are coarse, almost leathery, and emit what many consider an offensive odor when brushed against. The flower has five yellow petals and measures up to four inches from the base, and the fruit, which is green with white stripes but ripens to a yellowish green, is a globe-shaped gourd measuring 3-4 inches in diameter. The root can measure over one foot in diameter, and is described as spindle-shaped in some sources, thickest in the middle and tapering at each tip (Correll and Johnston 1970). The form of the root, however, is quite variable. Some buffalo gourd roots are over 15 inches wide at ground surface, and then split into two "legs" extending three feet deep, resembling a human form. Buffalo gourd is widespread in open disturbed areas in the Amistad Reservoir area. 

Both the root and the fruit/seed of the buffalo gourd were utilized by indigenous North Americans. They valued the root for its medicinal properties, and the seeds as a food source. The fruit and roots contain cucurbitacins, a group of triterpenoid glycosides that imparts a very bitter taste, and that can be poisonous in high concentrations. Cucurbitacins are produced by all members of the squash family, but they have been greatly reduced in domesticated squashes and cucumbers. The buffalo gourd, however, is rich in cucurbitacin and consumption of this plant requires some processing. Although there are accounts of other parts being consumed, most references mention only the seeds as a food source. The shell of the gourd, the leaves and stems, and the root had other applications. 

The seeds are edible and several Native American groups used them for food. Because of the widespread use of the seeds and the size of the taproot buffalo gourd was thought to be a potential dry-lands food source, hence, it was the subject of nutritional research. The seeds contain between 25-42% fat (Berry et al. 1976). Fat in the form of vegetable oil would be a critical dietary component in a desert, where animals carry very little fat on their bodies. Buffalo gourd seeds are also high in protein (22-35%) making them comparable to some legume seeds.

The seeds were roasted or boiled, and either eaten or ground into a meal. The Gila River Pimas of Arizona parched the seeds and ate them (Russell 1908:70). Other groups, such as the Luiseno and the Cahuilla of southern California, ground the seeds, mixing the resulting flour with water into a mush or paste (Bean and Saubel 1972:57; Sparkman 1908:229).

Pueblo Hubbard Squash

=====
Sometimes you happen on something so good you wonder how could this have almost slipped into extinction? Pueblo Hubbard is a diverse squash, a true landrace. Expect a cornucopia of shapes from warty hubbards with ribbing and colorful stripes to fat pink bananas and egg shapes to round blues with pinkish hues, and more! It is clear this squash was selected for culinary flavor not shape. However, while diverse in shape, it is uniformly the most amazing squash that has ever touched my lips. The dark orange-red flesh is custardy, richly sweet, and never stringy. Interestingly the seeds are slightly puffy and roast up nicely to make a delicious snack, less chewy than other squash seeds I've trialed. By keeping these often shiny hard-shelled squashes around 50F, I've found most keep right through the winter into the early spring.

This is a working name as it's original name has been lost. This squash comes from the highlands of New Mexico – known for the extremes of blistering hot days and frigid cold nights and even occasional summer frosts. True to form, this squash has some frost resistance in the foliage as far as squashes go. The story I was told is that about ten years ago, a worker was tearing down a house that had been abandoned for a long time. The previous owner was a Native American man with no immediate family. Inside the house, a glass jar was found behind a wall. It was estimated at the time that the seeds were at least 30 years old. The worker kept this jar of seeds for several years as a novelty until someone suggested that they might still be viable. A small patch of fruits were grown out and the seeds were sent to a gardener in Nevada. My original seed came from a friend who received some of this seed from this person in Nevada. To my knowledge, this squash has not been kept by anyone else and is otherwise lost, until now. This has become one of my go-to squashes and you will see why!

=====
Yakima Marblehead is a hubbard type generally on the large size, slate gray in color with slight ribbing, flesh is golden yellow and stringy, and seeds are white which is a bit unusual. It is fine baked, use this as you would a spaghetti squash. These squashes have a hard rind and easily store in ideal conditions around 50F right through the winter with many storing into the spring.

Current theories suggest that until very recently, historically most of North America only had access to Cucurbita pepo squashes. It was only when the Spaniards brought with them the hubbards and other Cucurbita maxima types that North America was introduced to this wonderful squash species. Sadly, as quickly as many had arrived or been bred, many disappeared. The Marbleheads of the Pacific Northwest are one of those squashes. There are two types of Marblehead, the Umatilla and Yakima. Marblehead appears to have been introduced by James J. H. Gregory and sons in 1873 in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Late in the 1940's Gill Brothers Seed Company of Portland, OR offered these two strains. I do not know more about its history in Washington and Oregon and if the Yakima tribe played a part in the development of this strain, but I believe Umatilla was developed in an Eastern Oregon Research Station and that an earlier strain, the Yakima Marblehead, was selected in Washington.

Cushaw of Martinique

=====
This scarce heirloom variety of fragrant squash was first brought to the US during the 1790s by black émigrés from the West Indies. A classic feature of the Creole cuisine of the islands, the Martinique Cushaw quickly became a key ingredient in Philadelphia pepperpots, soups, veloutés, flans, and other dishes calling for rich, tropical flavor. Its French name giraumon derives from the term jurumu, a word for squash in the language of the Tupi people of coastal Brazil. Giraumon is generally rendered into English as cushaw since it refers almost exclusively to members of the moschata species.

Rampant 10 to 20 foot vines produce round or slightly oblong fruits weighing anywhere from 15 to 25 pounds, although there are also many smaller ones. The deep orange flesh is rich in Vitamin A and the extra-large flowers are excellent for stuffing. The fruits can be harvested young while green and flecked with white, or they can be harvested later as they ripen to dark orange. Unlike many tropical squash, this variety stores well and will keep for several months. Due to the invasive nature of the vines, we recommend this variety for small field culture.

Many of the plants (but not all) will have a tendency to put out short runners or sprawl after initial bush growth.

Tatume

http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/newsletters/hortupdate/2010/jun/tatume.html[+http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/newsletters/hortupdate/2010/jun/tatume.html+]

=====
Tatume is a hardy, open-pollinated variety that does very well in our hot Texas climate. Unlike the bushing habit of zucchini or yellow crookneck, ‘tatume’ produces very long vines like a gourd. The long vines are prolific bloomers and produce a large amount of flowers that are beautiful to look at and almost as good to eat as the squash itself. It is a big producer and its fruit is more firm and flavorful than yellow squash or zucchini. Plus, as a huge added bonus, ‘tatume’ is almost immune to the squash vine borer! In my opinion, all of these traits combine to make ‘tatume’ the perfect summer squash for the Texas garden.

Whether you grow from seeds or transplants, be prepared for rapid vine growth. The first year I grew ‘tatume’ I planted my transplants in early April. By late April I was beginning to wonder what I had gotten myself into. In three weeks time the plant sent out vines that were more than six feet long! In addition, each place a node lay against the ground, it rooted and sent out more vines. The “aggressive” vining habit of this plant is about the only thing bad I can say about it. If you choose to grow ‘tatume,’ put it in a place that allows it room to grow since it is not uncommon for it to send out 12-foot vines in all directions.

The rapid rate of vine growth slows noticeably once the blooms start. Since ‘tatume’ creates such a large plant, it produces a lot of flowers. These flowers are full of pollen that is irresistible to bees. When in bloom, your garden will literally be “abuzz” with the sound of all of the bees that are working the “squash blossoms.” This is a good thing. Without pollinators, the pollen from the male plant will not reach the female flowers.

If you want to ensure good pollination without bees, you can pollinate your squash by hand. Since squash produce large amounts of fairly large pollen, they are very easy to pollinate by hand. Squash plants (and all cucurbits for that matter) produce both male and female flowers. The male and female flowers are very easy to identify. Female flowers have a miniature fruit beginning to develop under the flower. If you see no fruit, then the flower is male. To hand pollinate, pick a male flower from the plant and remove all of the petals. You will be left with a stem and the pollen-covered stamen. Use the stamen as a paint brush to apply the pollen to the pistol inside the female flower.

After pollination, the plant begins to set fruit. The fruit of the ‘tatume’ is round or oblate in shape. The skin of the fruit is striped green and resembles a small watermelon or pumpkin in immature form. The fruits develop quickly. Once you find a small fruit in all of that foliage, it is a good idea to keep an eye on it. If it is receiving ample water, it will go from the size of the end of your finger to harvest size in about a week. It is best to pick ‘tatume’ when it is about the size of a baseball. If allowed to grow bigger than this, the seeds begin to get firm and make the flesh a lot less fun to eat.

This is a mixture of our dark green, light green, yellow and white oval squash.  The parent of all these lines is Tatume, a very resilient green pumpkin from the southwest U.S. which we liked because of it's productivity even during hot and dry weather and resistance to insects and disease.  Several years ago we crossed mother Tatume to the best tasting of our summer zucchini squash.  These delightful oval squash are the children of Tatume.  The vines are productive and the squash is widely acclaimed for slicing and grilling when young.  They mature into an interesting assemblage of striped and mottled oval pumpkins which can be baked or used in hearty vegetable soups in native tradition.

Cudrania tricuspidata (Chinese Mulberry)
----------------------------------------

*Other names:* Che, Chinese Che, Chinese Mulberry, Cudrang, Mandarin Melon Berry, Silkworm Thorn

http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/che.html[+http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/che.html+]

=====
The che requires minimal care and has a tolerance of drought and poor soils similar to that of the related mulberry. It can be grown in most parts of California and other parts of the country, withstanding temperatures of -20° F. 

The deciduous trees can eventually grow to about 25 ft. in height, but often remains a broad, spreading bush or small tree if not otherwise trained when they are young. Immature wood is thorny but loses its thorns as it matures. Female trees are larger and more robust than male trees. 

The alternate leaves resemble those of the mulberry, but are smaller and thinner and pale yellowish-green in color. The typical form is distinctly trilobate, with the central lobe sometimes twice as long as the lateral ones, but frequently unlobed leaves of varied outlines are also found on the same plant. As the plant grows, the tendency seems towards larger and entire leaves, with at the most indistinct or irregular lobing. The general form of the leaves comprise many variations between oblong and lanceolate. The che leafs and blooms late in spring--after apples. 

The che is dioecious, with male and female flowers on different plants. Appearing in June, both types of flowers are green and pea-sized. The male flowers turn yellow as the pollen ripens and is released, while the wind-pollinated female flowers develop many small stigmas over the surface of the immature fruit. Male plants occasionally have a few female flowers which will set fruit. 

Like the related mulberry, the che fruit is not a berry but a collective fruit, in appearance somewhat like a round mulberry crossed with a lychee, 1 to 2 inches in diameter. The ripe fruits are an attractive red or maroon-red color with a juicy, rich red flesh inside and 3 to 6 small brown seeds per fruit. The flavor is quite unlike the vinous quality of better mulberries. While still firm they are almost tasteless, but when fully soft ripe they develop a watermelon-like flavor that can be quite delicious. The sugar content is similar to that of a ripe fig. In colder areas with early leaf drop the bright red fruit are an attractive sight dangling from smooth, leafless branches. 

Ches need a warm, sunny location. They should not be planted near sidewalks since the fallen fruit will stain. Like the mulberry, the trees are quite wind-resistant. One method of planting is to put a male and a female plant in a single site, about 1 ft. apart, and prune to a combined volume of approximately 25% male and 75% female.

Cyphomandra betacea (tamarillo)
-------------------------------

*Other names*: tamarillo, tree tomato, tamamoro, tomate de árbol

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarillo[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarillo+]

=====
The tamarillo is native to the Andes of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. Today, it is still cultivated in gardens and small orchards for local production,[4] and it is one of the most popular fruits in these regions.

The plant is a fast-growing tree that grows up to 5 meters. Peak production is reached after 4 years,[6] and the life expectancy is about 12 years.[4] The tree usually forms a single upright trunk with lateral branches. The flowers and fruits hang from the lateral branches. The leaves are large, simple and perennial, and have a strong pungent smell.[6] The flowers are pink-white, and form clusters of 10 to 50 flowers. They produce 1 to 6 fruits per cluster. Plants can set fruit without cross-pollination, but the flowers are fragrant and attract insects. Cross-pollination seems to improve fruit set.[6] The roots are shallow and not very pronounced, therefore the plant is not tolerant to drought stress, and can be damaged by strong winds. Tamarillos will hybridize with many other solanaceae, though the hybrid fruits will be sterile, and unpalatable in some instances.

The fruit is eaten by scooping the flesh from a halved fruit. When lightly sugared and cooled, the flesh is used for a breakfast dish. Some people in New Zealand cut the fruit in half, scoop out the pulpy flesh and spread it on toast at breakfast. Yellow-fruited cultivars have a sweeter flavor, occasionally compared to mango or apricot. The red-fruited variety, which is much more widely cultivated, is more tart, and the savory aftertaste is far more pronounced. In the Northern Hemisphere, tamarillos are most frequently available from July until November, and fruits early in the season tend to be sweeter and less astringent.

=====
Desmanthus illinoensis (Illinois Bundle Flower) is bushy and smooth, growing up to 4' tall. Flowering June through August, the round clusters appear fuzzy due to long stamens projecting from each flower. The small numerous paired leaflets are delicate in appearance and resemble those of a fern.

This is a legume species (member of the pea family).  Most legumes harbor beneficial bacteria called rhizobia on their roots.  Prairie Moon provides genus-specific strains of this bacterium called inoculum for legume seed free of charge with the purchase of legume seed.  To properly inoculate your legume seed prior to planting, follow germination code I below.

=====
This native US prairie herb has been the subject of domestication efforts by the Land Institute for decades. Land Institute breeders have had substantial gains towards developing non-shattering (seeds held in pod until harvest), higher-yielding, large-seeded varieties. The challenge they are currently facing is the poor flavor of the cooked beans, with several processing techniques under investigation.

Diospyros digyna (black sapote)
-------------------------------

*Other names*: black sapote, black persimmon, sapote negro, zapote, zapote prieto, ebano

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/black_sapote.html[+https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/black_sapote.html+]

=====
The black sapote is not, as might be assumed, allied to either the sapote (Pouteria sapota H.E. Moore & Stearn) or the white sapote (Casimiroa edulis Llave & Lex.). Instead, it is closely related to the persimmon in the family Ebenaceae. For many years it has been widely misidentified as Diospyros ebenaster Retz., a name confusingly applied also to a strictly wild species of the West Indies now distinguished as D. revoluta Poir. The presently accepted binomial for the black sapote is D. digyna Jacq. (syn. D. obtusifolia Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.).
In Spanish, it is known variously as sapote, sapote negro, zapote, zapote negro, zapote prieto, zapote de mico, matasano (or matazano) de mico, or ebano. It has been called black persimmon in Hawaii.

The tree is handsome, broad-topped, slow-growing, to 80 ft (25 m) in height, with furrowed trunk to 30 in (75 cm) in diameter, and black bark. The evergreen, alternate leaves, elliptic-oblong to oblong-lanceolate, tapered at both ends or rounded at the base and bluntly acute at the apex, are leathery, glossy, 4 to 12 in (10-30 cm) long. The flowers, borne singly or in groups of 3 to 7 in the leaf axils, are tubular, lobed, white, 3/8 to 5/8 in (1-1.6 cm) wide, with persistent green calyx. Some have both male and female organs, large calyx lobes and are faintly fragrant; others are solely male and have a pronounced gardenia-like scent and a few black specks in the throat of the corolla. The fruit is bright-green and shiny at first; oblate or nearly round; 2 to 5 in (5-12.5 cm) wide; with a prominent, 4-lobed, undulate calyx, 1 1/2 to 2 in (4-5 cm) across, clasping the base. On ripening, the smooth, thin skin becomes olive-green and then rather muddy-green. Within is a mass of glossy, brown to very dark-brown, almost black, somewhat jelly-like pulp, soft, sweet and mild in flavor. In the center, there may be 1 to 10 flat, smooth, brown seeds, 3/4 to 1 in (2-2.5 cm) long, but the fruits are often seedless.

The black sapote is native along both coasts of Mexico from Jalisco to Chiapas, Veracruz and Yucatan and in the forested lowlands of Central America, and it is frequently cultivated throughout this range. It was apparently carried by the Spaniards to Amboina before 1692, and to the Philippines long before 1776, and eventually reached Malacca, Mauritius, Hawaii, Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In 1919, seeds from Guadalajara, Mexico, were sent to the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture; cuttings and seeds were received from the Isle of Pines, Cuba, in 1915; seeds arrived from Hawaii in 1916 and 1917; others from Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1920. Numerous seedlings have been grown in southern California but all have been killed by low temperatures. The tree does very well in southern Florida, though it has been grown mainly as a curiosity. Outside of its homeland, the fruit has not achieved any great popularity. In Mexico, the fruits are regularly marketed.

Unkind writers have employed unflattering phrases in describing the flesh of the black sapote and have probably hindered its acceptance. This seems quite unreasonable because the color and texture of the pulp closely match stewed prunes, to which there seems to be no aesthetic objection. In the Philippines, the seeded pulp is served as dessert with a little milk or orange juice poured over it. The addition of lemon or lime juice makes the pulp desirable as a filling for pies and other pastry. It is also made into ice cream. In Mexico, the pulp may be mashed, beaten or passed through a colander and mixed with orange juice or brandy, and then served with or without whipped cream. Also, they sometimes mix the pulp with wine, cinnamon and sugar and serve as dessert. Some Floridians use an eggbeater to blend the pulp with milk and ground nutmeg. A foamy, delicious beverage is made by mixing the pulp with canned pineapple juice in an electric blender. In Central America, the fermented fruits are made into a liqueur somewhat like brandy.

Dimocarpus longan (longan)
--------------------------

*Other names:*  longan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longan[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longan+]

=====
The longan (literally "dragon eye" in Chinese) is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris). The seed is small, round and hard, and of an enamel-like, lacquered black. The fully ripened, freshly harvested shell is bark-like, thin, and firm, making the fruit easy to shell by squeezing the fruit out as if one is "cracking" a sunflower seed. When the shell has more moisture content and is more tender, the fruit becomes less convenient to shell. The tenderness of the shell varies due to either premature harvest, variety, weather conditions, or transport/storage conditions.

The Dimocarpus longan tree is a medium-sized evergreen that can grow up to 6 to 7 metres (20 to 23 ft) in height. It is somewhat sensitive to frost. Longan trees prefer sandy soil. While the species prefers temperatures that do not typically fall below 4.5 °C (40 °F), it can withstand brief temperature drops to about −2 °C (28 °F).[3] Longans usually bear fruit slightly later than lychees.

The fruit is sweet, juicy and succulent in superior agricultural varieties and, apart from being eaten fresh, is also often used in Asian soups, snacks, desserts, and sweet-and-sour foods, either fresh or dried, sometimes canned with syrup. The taste is different from lychees; while longan have a drier sweetness, lychees are often messily juicy with a more tropical, sour sweetness.
The seed and the shell are not consumed

Dried longan are often used in Chinese cuisine and Chinese sweet dessert soups. In Chinese food therapy and herbal medicine, it is believed to have an effect on relaxation[citation needed]. In contrast with the fresh fruit, which is juicy and white, the flesh of dried longans is dark brown to almost black. In Chinese medicine, the longan, much like the lychee, is thought to give internal "heat".

Dioscorea bulbifera (air potato)
--------------------------------

*Other names*: air potato

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_bulbifera[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_bulbifera+]

=====
Dioscorea bulbifera is a perennial vine with broad leaves and two types of storage organs. The plant forms bulbils in the leaf axils of the twining stems, and tubers beneath the ground. These tubers are like small, oblong potatoes. Some varieties are edible and cultivated as a food crop, especially in West Africa. The tubers of edible varieties often have a bitter taste, which can be removed by boiling. They can then be prepared in the same way as other yams, potatoes, and sweet potatoes.
The air potato is one of the most widely-consumed yam species. It can grow up to 150 feet tall.

Air potato can grow extremely quickly, roughly 8 inches per day,[3] and eventually reach over 60 feet long[citation needed]. It typically climbs to the tops of trees and has a tendency to take over native plants. New plants develop from bulbils that form on the plant, and these bulbils serve as a means of dispersal. The aerial stems of air potato die back in winter, but resprouting occurs from bulbils and underground tubers.

The primary means of spread and reproduction are via bulbils. The smallest bulbils make control of air potato difficult due to their ability to sprout at a very small stage. The vine produces small white flowers, however these are rarely seen when it grows in Florida. The fruits are capsules.

Dovyalis hebecarpa (Ceylon gooseberry)
--------------------------------------

*Other names:* kei apple, ketembilla, Ceylon gooseberry, kitambilla

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/ketembilla_ars.html[+https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/ketembilla_ars.html+]

=====
The shrub or small tree reaches no more than 15-20 ft (4.5-6 m) in height but its long, slender, arching, wide-spreading branches may cover 30 ft (9 m) of ground. Sharp spines to 1 1/2 in (4 cm) long, are plentiful on the trunk and lower branches. The alternate leaves are elliptical to ovate, pointed, 2 3/4 to 4 in (7-10 cm) long, wavy-margined, gray-green, finely velvety, with pinkish, woolly petioles, and thin in texture. Male, female and hermaphrodite flowers are borne on separate trees. They are petalless, greenish-yellow, nearly 1/2 in (1.25 cm) wide and clustered in the leaf axils. The fruit, borne in great abundance, is globose, 1/2 to 1 in (1.25-2.5 cm) wide. Its thin, bitter skin turns from somewhat orange to dark purple on ripening and is coated with short, grayish-green, velvety hairs, unpleasant in the mouth. The pulp is very juicy, extremely acid, purple-red, enclosing 9 to 12 hairy seeds about 1/4 in (6 mm) long.

The ketembilla is native to Ceylon. It was introduced into the United States by Dr. David Fairchild and was one of the few fruits he admitted he never liked very much. The first fruiting specimens in the western hemisphere were apparently those growing in southern Florida. P.J. Wester carried seeds to the northern islands of the Philippines where it began fruiting in 1916. From Florida, also, the plant was introduced into the Atkins Garden of Harvard University at Cienfuegos, Cuba. Seeds from the Garden were shipped to the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association in 1920, and to the Lancetilla Experimental Garden at Tela, Honduras, in 1927. Seeds from Florida were supplied to the Mayaguez and Trujillo Experimental Stations in Puerto Rico where the plants were 16 ft (5 in) high by 1929 and 1930. Plants were distributed widely throughout the Hawaiian Islands and use of the fruits was officially encouraged.

Florida pioneers grew the species and utilized the fruits until the plants took up too much space. When South Florida began to develop rapidly after World War II, most people had no room for such an aggressive plant. One enthusiast maintained a small commercial plot in West Palm Beach for juice production.
In 1935, horticulturists in Israel imported seeds from Ceylon and plants grew and fruited well in a variety of locations. Commercial exploitation was anticipated but was suspended during World War II because of the shortage of sugar for preserving.

In Florida, in the past, the ketembilla was used primarily for jelly. Recipes developed in Hawaii include juice, spiced jelly, ketembilla-papaya jam, ketembilla-guava jelly, and ketembilla-apple butter. In Israel, the fruit is valued mainly as a source of jelly for export.

Echinopsis pachanoi (San Pedro cactus)
--------------------------------------

*Other names:* San Pedro cactus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinopsis_pachanoi[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinopsis_pachanoi+]

=====
Echinopsis pachanoi (syn. Trichocereus pachanoi) — known as San Pedro cactus — is a fast-growing columnar cactus native to the Andes Mountains at 2,000–3,000 m (6,600–9,800 ft) in altitude.[1][2] It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru,[3] and it is cultivated in other parts of the world. Uses for it include traditional medicine and traditional veterinary medicine, and it is widely grown as an ornamental cactus. It has been used for healing and religious divination in the Andes Mountains region for over 3,000 years.[4] It is sometimes confused with its close relative, Echinopsis peruviana (Peruvian torch cactus).

Echinopsis pachanoi is native to Ecuador and Peru. Its stems are light to dark green, sometimes glaucous, with a diameter of 6–15 cm (2.4–5.9 in) and usually 6–8 ribs. The whitish areoles may produce up to seven yellow to brown spines, each up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long; the plant is sometimes spineless.[2] The areoles are spaced evenly along the ribs, approximately 2 cm (0.8 in) apart.[3] Echinopsis pachanoi is normally 3–6 m (10–20 ft) tall and has multiple branches, usually extending from the base.[2] The tallest recorded specimen was 12.2 metres (40 ft) tall.[3] White flowers are produced at the end of the stems; they open at night. The flowers are large, around 19–24 cm (7.5–9.4 in) long with a diameter of up to 20 cm (7.9 in). There are black hairs along the length of the tube leading to the flower. Oblong dark green fruits are produced after fertilization, about 3 cm (1.2 in) across and 5–6 cm (2.0–2.4 in) long.

Echinopsis pachanoi has a long history of being used in Andean traditional medicine. Archeological studies have found evidence of use going back two thousand years, to Moche culture.[5] Although Roman Catholic church authorities[who?] after the Spanish conquest attempted to suppress its use.

=====
Eccremocarpus Scaber Chilean Glory Flower or Glory Vine is a fast-growing, evergreen climbing vine. The Glory Vine has tubular flowers that grow in clusters and are in colors of orange, yellow, pink, and shades of red. A long bloomer, Chilean Glory Flower has flowers from spring to autumn. The leaves are light green, small, oval-shaped and boldly veined. This climbing vine will quickly cover a trellis or arbor and makes a wonderful display in the landscape.

Chilean Glory Vine, Eccremocarpus Scaber, is the perfect flowering plant for hummingbirds, and they visit it all day long. Chilean Glory Vine looks delicate, but it is vigorous and easy to grow and is considered a perennial in USDA Zones 9 - 10, but it will grow like an annual in colder zones. For areas with a long growing season, start the Eccremocarpus Scaber seeds directly outdoors in a prepared seedbed. In colder zones, start the flower seeds indoors 6 - 8 weeks before the end of frost season.

Eriobotrya japonica (loquat)
----------------------------

*Other names*: loquat

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/loquat.html[+https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/loquat.html+]

=====
A fruit of wide appeal, the loquat, Eriobotrya japonica Lindl., (syn. Mespilus japonicus Thunb.), of the rose family, Rosaceae, has been called Japan, or Japanese, plum and Japanese medlar. To the Italians, it is nespola giapponese; to French-speaking people, it is néflier du Japon, or bibassier. In the German language, it is japanische mispel, or wollmispel; in Spanish, nispero, nispero japonés, or nispero del Japón; in Portuguese, ameixa amarella, or ameixa do Japao.

A tree of moderate size, the loquat may reach 20 to 30 ft (6-9 in), has a rounded crown, short trunk, and woolly new twigs. The evergreen leaves, mostly whorled at the branch tips, are elliptical-lanceolate to obovate lanceolate, 5 to 12 in (12.5-30 cm) long and 3 to 4 in (7.5-10 cm) wide; dark-green and glossy on the upper surface, whitish-or rusty-hairy beneath, thick, stiff, with conspicuous parallel, oblique veins, each usually terminating at the margin in a short, prickly point. Sweetly fragrant flowers, borne in rusty-hairy, terminal panicles of 30 to 100 blooms, are white, 5-petalled, 1/2 to 3/4 in (1.25-2 cm) wide. The fruits, in clusters of 4 to 30, are oval, rounded or pear-shaped, 1 to 2 in (2.5-5 cm) long, with smooth or downy, yellow to orange, sometimes red-blushed, skin, and white, yellow or orange, succulent pulp, of sweet to subacid or acid flavor. There may be 1 to 10 seeds, though, ordinarily, only 3 to 5, dark-brown or light-brown, angular -ellipsoid, about 5/8 in (1.5 cm) long and 5/16 in (8 mm) thick.

The loquat is indigenous to southeastern China and possibly southern Japan, though it may have been introduced into Japan in very early times. It is said to have been cultivated in Japan for over 1, 000 years. The western world first learned of it from the botanist Kaempfer in 1690. Thunberg, who saw it in Japan in 1712, provided a more elaborate description. It was planted in the National Gardens, Paris, in 1784 and plants were taken from Canton, China, to the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, England, in 1787. Soon, the tree was grown on the Riviera and in Malta and French North Africa (Algeria) and the Near East and fruits were appearing on local markets. In 1818, excellent fruits were being produced in hothouses in England. The tree can be grown outdoors in the warmest locations of southern England.

In the New World, it is cultivated from northern South America, Central America and Mexico to California: also, since 1867, in southern Florida and northward to the Carolinas, though it does not fruit north of Jacksonville. It was quite common as a small-fruited ornamental in California gardens in the late 1870's. The horticulturist, C.P. Taft, began seedling selection and distributed several superior types before the turn of the century, but further development was slow. Dwarfing on quince root-stocks has encouraged expansion of loquat cultivation in Israel since 1960. In the northern United States and Europe, the tree is grown in greenhouses as an ornamental, especially var. variegata with white and pale-green splashes on the leaves.

The skin of the loquat is easily removed. Peeled and seeded fruits are eaten fresh, sometimes combined with sliced banana, orange sections and grated coconut. They are delicious simply stewed with a little sugar added. The fruits are also used in gelatin desserts or as pie-filling, or are chopped and cooked as a sauce. Loquats canned in sirup are exported from Taiwan. Some people prepare spiced loquats (with cloves, cinnamon, lemon and vinegar) in glass jars. The fruit is also made into jam and, when slightly underripe, has enough pectin to make jelly. The jelly was formerly manufactured commercially in California on a small scale.

Eryngium foetidum (culantro)

*Other names:*  culantro

https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-506.html[+https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-506.html+]

=====
Culantro (Eryngium foetidum L., Apiaceae) is a biennial herb indigenous to continental Tropical America and the West Indies. Although widely used in dishes throughout the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Far East, culantro is relatively unknown in the United States and many other parts of the world and is often mistaken and misnamed for its close relative cilantro or coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.). Some of its common names descriptive of the plant include: spiny or serrated coriander, shado beni and bhandhania (Trinidad and Tobago), chadron benee (Dominica), coulante (Haiti), recao (Puerto Rico), and fit weed (Guyana). 

Culantro grows naturally in shaded moist heavy soils near cultivated areas. Under cultivation, the plant thrives best under well irrigated shaded conditions. Like its close relative cilantro, culantro tends to bolt and flower profusely under hot high-light long days of summer months.

The appearance of culantro and cilantro are different but the leaf aromas are similar, although culantro is more pungent. Because of this aroma similarity the leaves are used interchangeably in many food preparations and is the major reason for the misnaming of one herb for the other. While relatively new to American cuisine, culantro has long been used in the Far East, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In Asia, culantro is most popular in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore where it is commonly used with or in lieu of cilantro and topped over soups, noodle dishes, and curries. In Latin America, culantro is mostly associated with the cooking style of Puerto Rico, where recipes common to all Latin countries are enhanced with culantro. The most popular and ubiquitous example is salsa, a spicy sauce prepared from tomatoes, garlic, onion, lemon juice, with liberal amounts of chiles. These constituents are fried and simmered together, mixed to a smooth paste and spiced with fresh herbs including culantro. Salsa is usually consumed with tortilla chips as an appetizer. Equally popular is sofrito or recaito, the name given to the mixture of seasonings containing culantro and widely used in rice, stews, and soups (Wilson 1991). There are reportedly as many variations of the recipe as there are cooks in Puerto Rico but basically sofrito consists of garlic, onion, green pepper, small mild peppers, and both cilantro and culantro leaves. Ingredients are blended and can then be refrigerated for months. Sofrito is itself the major ingredient in a host of other recipes including eggplant pasta sauce, cilantro garlic butter, cilantro pesto, pineapple salsa, and gazpacho with herb yogurt.

If you cook Carribean cuisine (or hail from Southest Asia), you crave the familiar flavor of Culantro (Shado beni, Ngo Gai, Phak Chi Farang, Cilantro Coyote). It tastes like home. You won't find it in the local supermarket, but you can grow it in your garden.

Eryngium foetidum is known by many names around the world , Culantro, Racao, Shado beni, Cilantro Coyote, Ngo Gai, Phak Chi Farang. Its pungent flavor is essential to soups, stews, and sauces in many tropical cuisines and nothing else will do.

Culantro loves heat. It's perennial in zones 10-11, annual elsewhere, and does just fine in a pot. Plant as you would basil, but don't expect seedlings to appear for two to three weeks. They need warm soil, and high humidity, but take care not to over-water. The young seedlings dampen off easily. If you haven't grown up with the herb, treat it as an exotic tropical. It will germinate on schedule, but takes special care and some patience.

Erythrina edulis (Chachafruto)
------------------------------

*Other names*: Frijol mompás, Pajuro, Sachaporoto del basul, Poroto del sacha, Chachafruto, Balú, Baluy, Sachaporoto, Guato

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrina_edulis[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrina_edulis+]

=====
Erythrina edulis (Basul) is a nitrogen fixing tree that is native to the Andean region from western Venezuela to southern Bolivia.
Although it is widely known, it is not commonly cultivated. Future research is needed, especially in agroforestry.[1] Basul is a legume and so it produces protein-rich beans covered in pods which can be used for human or animal nutrition. The leaves and branches can be used as fodder. Besides the agricultural aspects, Erythrina edulis can also be used as a fence plant.

Erythrina edulis is a vigorous, fast-growing precocious legume species, and is considered one of the easiest trees to grow.[citation needed] As it is sensitive to the cold, it grows only in the tropics and is not suitable for temperate regions. Optimum temperatures are between 15 and 22 °C (59 and 72 °F)),[3] and it grows in a broad range of altitudes (from 900-3200 a.s.l.).[clarification needed] In its native habitat, the average annual precipitation varies between 450 and 1,800 mm (18 and 71 in).[1] Erythrina edulis grows best in well-drained soils with a sandy or clayey texture and a pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.[3] Erythrina edulis is a totipotent plant and thus propagates easily. Hence, stems can be cut and planted into the soil and will sprout. Propagation can also be achieved by planting mature seeds and in most cases they germinate easily. Grafting is another possibility; the advantage is that seed production will start earlier. The seeds must be planted very soon after harvesting because they lose their viability 8 days after harvesting. The viability can be extended to 20 days when the seeds are covered in a thin paraffin layer.[4] Erythrina edulis produces a raceme of red flowers, which are pollinated by bees, wasps and birds.[2] The ripening of the seeds is not synchronized. The tree can live for decades and the older it gets, the more grain it will produce. A three- to four-year-old tree can produce about 30 kg (66 lb) of grain per year, while a 20-year-old tree reaches 120 to 210 kg (260 to 460 lb) of grain per year.[5] Thanks to the symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria, Erythrina edulis can fix atmospheric nitrogen and therefore does not need any additional nitrogen fertilizer.

=====
Chachafruto (Erythrina edulis) is a phenomenal food plant. A nitrogen-fixing tree, easily propagated by live stakes, it produces enormous pods full of edible beans. Yields are very high – 13 tons per hectare (three to four times higher than soybeans), yet chachafruto has received little breeding attention and is difficult to even acquire for testing outside of its native Andes. This species should be in every backyard in the highland tropics. A stunning example of the potential of perennial beans.

Eugenia aggregata (cherry of the Rio Grande)
--------------------------------------------

*Other names*: Cherry of the Rio Grande

http://edibleplantproject.org/cherryriogrande/[+http://edibleplantproject.org/cherryriogrande/+]

=====
This Cherry Tree (Eugenia aggregata)  grows as a narrow evergreen shrub, 10-20 ft high.
It flowers in the spring and summer. Flowers are followed in three weeks by 1-2″ oblong, dark- red/purple fruits that are sweet, have a thin skin and a single seed.
Cherry of the Rio Grande tolerates a wide range of soils, but can show signs of mineral deficiency in calcareous/basic soils, preferring those with a pH in the range of 5.5-6.8.
New plants should be lightly fertilized with a magnesium containing fertilizer that has a 1-1-1 ratio.

Fruit size and quality is largely a function of proper nutrition and irrigation.

Manilkara zapota (chico sapote)
-------------------------------

*Other names*: sapodilla, chico sapote

=====
One of the most interesting and desirable of all tropical fruit trees.

Among numerous vernacular names, some of the most common are: baramasi (Bengal and Bihar, India); buah chiku (Malaya); chicle (Mexico); chico (Philippines, Guatemala, Mexico); chicozapote (Guatemala, Mexico, Venezuela); chikoo (India); chiku (Malaya, India); dilly (Bahamas; British West Indies); korob (Costa Rica); mespil (Virgin Islands); mispel, mispu (Netherlands Antilles, Surinam); muy (Guatemala); muyozapot (El Salvador); naseberry (Jamaica; British West Indies); neeseberry (British West Indies; nispero (Puerto Rico, Central America, Venezuela); nispero quitense (Ecuador); sapodilla plum (India); sapota (India); sapotí (Brazil); sapotille (French West Indies); tree potato (India); Ya (Guatemala; Yucatan); zapota (Venezuela); zapote (Cuba); zapote chico (Mexico; Guatemala); zapote morado (Belize); zapotillo (Mexico).

The sapodilla is a fairly slow-growing, long-lived tree, upright and elegant, distinctly pyramidal when young; to 60 ft (18 m) high in the open but reaching 100 ft (30 m) when crowded in a forest. It is strong and wind-resistant, rich in white, gummy latex. Its leaves are highly ornamental, evergreen, glossy, alternate, spirally clustered at the tips of the forked twigs; elliptic, pointed at both ends, firm, 3 to 4 1/2 in (7.5-11.25 cm) long and 1 to 1 1/2 in (2.5-4 cm) wide. Flowers are small and bell-like, with 3 brown-hairy outer sepals and 3 inner sepals enclosing the pale-green corolla and 6 stamens. They are borne on slender stalks at the leaf bases. The fruit may be nearly round, oblate, oval, ellipsoidal, or conical; varies from 2 to 4 in (5-10 cm) in width. When immature it is hard, gummy and very astringent. Though smooth-skinned it is coated with a sandy brown scurf until fully ripe. The flesh ranges in color from yellowish to light- or dark-brown or sometimes reddish-brown; may be coarse and somewhat grainy or smooth; becomes soft and very juicy, with a sweet flavor resembling that of a pear. Some fruits are seedless, but normally there may be from 3 to 12 seeds which are easily removed as they are loosely held in a whorl of slots in the center of the fruit. They are brown or black, with one white margin; hard, glossy; long-oval, flat, with usually a distinct curved hook on one margin; and about 1/4 in (2 cm) long.

The sapodilla is believed native to Yucatan and possibly other nearby parts of southern Mexico, as well as northern Belize and Northeastern Guatemala. In this region there were once 100,000,000 trees. The species is found in forests throughout Central America where it has apparently been cultivated since ancient times. It was introduced long ago throughout tropical America and the West Indies, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Florida Keys and the southern part of the Florida mainland. Early in colonial times, it was carried to the Philippines and later was adopted everywhere in the Old World tropics. It reached Ceylon in 1802.

Generally, the ripe sapodilla, unchilled or preferably chilled, is merely cut in half and the flesh is eaten with a spoon. It is an ideal dessert fruit as the skin, which is not eaten, remains firm enough to serve as a "shell". Care must be taken not to swallow a seed, as the protruding hook might cause lodging in the throat. The flesh, of course, may be scooped out and added to fruit cups or salads. A dessert sauce is made by peeling and seeding ripe sapodillas, pressing the flesh through a colander, adding orange juice, and topping with whipped cream. Sapodilla flesh may also be blended into an egg custard mix before baking.

Moringa oleifera (drumstick tree)
---------------------------------

*Other names*: drumstick tree, horseradish tree, ben oil tree, benzoil tree

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa_oleifera[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa_oleifera+]

=====
Moringa oleifera is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Moringa, which is the only genus in the family Moringaceae. English common names include: moringa,[2] drumstick tree[2] (from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), horseradish tree[2] (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), ben oil tree, or benzoil tree[2] (from the oil which is derived from the seeds). It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree, native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas where its young seed pods and leaves are used as vegetables. It can also be used for water purification and hand washing, and is sometimes used in herbal medicine.

Moringa oleifera is a fast-growing, deciduous tree.[5] It can reach a height of 10–12 m (32–40 ft) [6] and the trunk can reach a diameter of 45 cm (1.5 ft).[7] The bark has a whitish-grey colour and is surrounded by thick cork. Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white, hairy bark. The tree has an open crown of drooping, fragile branches and the leaves build up a feathery foliage of tripinnate leaves.

White mulberry leaves are cooked and eaten in at least several areas of Latin America. They are very high in protein, and selected varieties have very good flavor and texture. Fresh leaf yields can reach an astonishing 53 tons per hectare. Much is known about coppiced mulberry leaf production as it is a critical fodder for silkworm production and also widely used as a fodder for other livestock. Now perhaps it will take its place as a human fodder as well. Some reports also indicate that dried mulberry fruit, along with hazelnuts, are or were the staple food of some Himalayan regions. They are delicious and filling, though information on nutrition and yields is hard to come by.

This is actually a pretty cool pea. Not only does the intense purple color turns heads but it also has many uses. The deep purple will turn to green when cooked but looks great plated raw. We use these as they have traditionally been used as a soup pea. Wait until they are almost bursting through the pod and dried down. They are especially loved during the New Years festivities as part of special soup for the Dutch. It is said the name Kapucijner is named after the capuchin monks whose robes were also of the same color. This is earlier than golden sweet snow pea for us.

Pouteria campechiana (canistel)
-------------------------------

*Other names*: canistel

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouteria_campechiana[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouteria_campechiana+]

=====
The canistel (Pouteria campechiana) is an evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America.[3] It is cultivated in other countries, such as Brazil, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines for its fruit.

The canistel grows up to 10 meters (33 ft) high, and produces orange-yellow fruit, also called yellow sapote, up to 7 centimeters (2.8 in) long, which are edible raw. Canistel flesh is sweet, with a texture often compared to that of a hard-boiled egg yolk, hence its colloquial name "eggfruit". It is closely related to the Mamey sapote and abiu.

The shape and size of the fruit is highly variable, depending on the cultivar. The better selections consistently produce large ovate fruit with glossy skin weighing upwards of 14 ounces. The flesh is somewhat pasty, although the best varieties have a creamy mousse-like texture. The flavor is rich and is reminiscent of an egg-custard.[4] The fruit may contain between one and six large brown seeds.

The canistel displays climacteric fruit ripening. A fully mature fruit shows an intense yellow skin color. It will eventually soften and drop from the tree. Insects and birds avoid the fruit flesh, perhaps because of its astringent properties, that are much reduced in senescent fruits, but still perceptible to the human palate. Apparently mature fruits severed from the tree while still hard often fail to develop the desired climacteric changes in terms of reduced astringency and a texture reminiscent of egg yolk. This, and the fact that climacteric fruits quickly start to decay at ambient temperatures, may have contributed to the low economic importance of the canistel.

As the related lucuma, the canistel can be eaten out of hand. The ripe fruit has been made into jam, marmalade, pancakes, and flour.[5] The ripe flesh is blended with milk and other ingredients to make a shake, and pureed it is sometimes added to custards or used in making ice cream.[2]

The wood of the tree is occasionally used in construction where it is available, especially as planks or rafters. In its native range, it has been a source of latex used to adulterate chicle.

Senecio confusus (Mexican flame vine)
-------------------------------------

*Other names*: Mexican flame vine, orangeglow vine

https://toptropicals.com/html/toptropicals/plant_wk/senecio.htm[+https://toptropicals.com/html/toptropicals/plant_wk/senecio.htm+]

=====
For sheer beauty, this flowering vine is hard to beat. Mexican Flame Vine is a great fast-growing everbloomer and butterfly attractor. The plant is good for beginners since it is drought resistant and hardly bothered by any pests. Minimum care is rewarded with impressive floral displays. It is a vigorous climber with thick evergreen leaves which deep green color provides a rich background for brilliant bright orange daisy-like flowers, borne in clusters. Blooms almost year round, from November through Spring when it is fully covered with gorgeous flowers, then blooms sporadically for the rest of the year.

The vine is originated from Mexico, as the common name indicates. It is a twining vine to 10 feet long with evergreen leaves that are shaped like arrowheads and serrated on the edges - a succulent type leaf similar to German Ivy. They are arranged alternately on the vine and create very dense deep green background for the "flame". As the flowers age, they change from orange to almost red to be followed by fruiting structures that resemble smaller versions of the dandelion puffy seed heads. This is a nectaring plant for butterflies, especially gulf fritillaries, and is also very attractive to hummingbirds.

The scientific name Senecio confusus translates to "confused" referring to this vine's rampant habit of growth. The flower is another point of "confusion", with an unusual-looking tangle of yellow fibers that are actually the styles. Without a support, a "confusion" of stems form a sprawling shrub. It can be also used as a dense groundcover if you let it go without regular trimming or control. It's a good idea to use Mexican Flame Vine to drape over porch rails or even mailboxes thanks to its drought resistance and very low maintanance requrements. It's the best choice for improving the visual charm of chain link fences. The vine can be planted as well in mixed hedges to create splashes of bright color. It also looks great clambering up palm or pine tree trunks. Suitable for Xeriscape.

The most profuse blooming is from November through Spring, then the plant blooms sporadically on and off for the rest of the year, leaving only a few weeeks every once in a while for short periods of rest.

Cultivation is very easy. The plant prefers full sun for more profuse blooming, but will also thrive in light shade. Water the young plant until established, then it becomes drought tolerant. Not particular about soil. This tropical vine is killed to the ground by frost, but even in Zone 8B gardens it will recover from roots in spring.

There will be no problems with spread of the vine by seed, but it will run along the ground and root between the leaf nodes. Judicious pruning once or twice a year keeps the vine under control. It normally does not outgrow small gardens and yards.

Solanum muricatum (pepino)
--------------------------

*Other names:*  pepino duoce, pepino, pepino melon, melon pear, tree melon

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_muricatum[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_muricatum+]

=====
Solanum muricatum is a species of evergreen shrub native to South America and grown for its sweet edible fruit.
It is known as pepino dulce ("sweet cucumber" in English, in order to differentiate it from cucumber which is also called "pepino" in Spanish) or simply pepino; the latter is also used for similar species such as "S. mucronatum" (which actually seems to belong in the related genus Lycianthes). The pepino dulce fruit resembles a melon (Cucumis melo) in color, and its flavor recalls a succulent mixture of honeydew and cucumber, and thus it is also sometimes called pepino melon or melon pear, but pepinos are only very distantly related to melons and pears. Another common name, "tree melon", is more often used for the Papaya (Carica papaya) though the pepino dulce plant generally does not look much like a tree; it looks more like a ground cover, trailing plant. The present species is, however, a close relative of other nightshades cultivated for their fruit, including the tomato (S. lycopersicum) and the eggplant (S. melongena), which its own fruit closely resembles.

The fruit is common in markets in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Chile, but less often overseas because it is quite sensitive to handling and does not travel well. Attempts to produce commercial cultivars and to export the fruit have been made in New Zealand, Turkey, Mauritius and Chile.

The pepino dulce is relatively hardy. In its native range it grows at altitudes ranging from close to sea level up to 3,000 m (10,000 ft.). However, it performs best in a warm, relatively frost-free climate. The plant can survive a low temperature of -2.5°C (27 to 28°F) if the freeze is not prolonged, though it may drop many of its leaves.[2] The species is a perennial, but its sensitivity to chilling, pests, and diseases force the growers to replant the crop every year. The crop also adapts well to greenhouse cultivation, training the plants up to 2 m tall, and obtaining yields that are 2-3 times larger than those obtained outdoors.

They are propagated by cuttings since they are established easily without rooting hormones. It is grown in a manner similar to its relatives such as the tomato, though it grows naturally upright by habit and can thus be cultivated as a free-standing bush, though it is sometimes pruned on trellises. Additionally, supports are sometimes used to keep the weight of the fruit from pulling the plant down. It has a fast growth rate and bears fruit within 4 to 6 months after planting. It is a perennial, but is usually cultivated as an annual. Seedlings are intolerant of weeds, but it can later easily compete with low growing weeds. Like their relatives tomatoes, eggplants, tomatillos and tamarillos, pepinos are extremely attractive to beetles, aphids, white flies and spider mites. Pepinos are tolerant of most soil types, but require constant moisture for good fruit production. Established bushes show some tolerance to drought stress, but this typically affects yield. The plants are parthenocarpic, meaning it needs no pollination to set fruit, though pollination will encourage fruiting.

Syzygium cumini (java plum)
---------------------------

*Other names:* java plum, jambolan, jambul, jamblang, jamun

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_cumini[+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_cumini+]

=====
A slow growing species, it can reach heights of up to 30 m and can live more than 100 years. Its dense foliage provides shade and is grown just for its ornamental value. At the base of the tree, the bark is rough and dark grey, becoming lighter grey and smoother higher up. The wood is water resistant. Because of this it is used in railway sleepers and to install motors in wells. It is sometimes used to make cheap furniture and village dwellings though it is relatively hard to work on.

The leaves which have an aroma similar to turpentine, are pinkish when young, changing to a leathery, glossy dark green with a yellow midrib as they mature. The leaves are used as food for livestock, as they have good nutritional value.

Syzygium cumini trees start flowering from March to April. The flowers are fragrant and small, about 5 mm in diameter. The fruits develop by May or June and resemble large berries; the fruit of Syzygium species is described as "drupaceous".[6] The fruit is oblong, ovoid, starts green and turns pink to shining crimson black as it matures. A variant of the tree produces white coloured fruit. The fruit has a combination of sweet, mildly sour and astringent flavour and tends to colour the tongue purple.

The seed is also used in various alternative healing systems like Ayurveda (to control diabetes, for example.[7][8]), Unani and Chinese medicine for digestive ailments.

The pulp of the fruit, extracts from the bark and seeds is of great benefit when it comes to lowering of blood glucose level. Taking dried extract of the seeds orally, greatly reduces the blood sugar and glucosuria.[9][dubious – discuss]

The leaves and bark are used for controlling blood pressure and gingivitis. Wine and vinegar are also made from the fruit. It has a high source in vitamin A and vitamin C.

=====
Called wakatay or huacatay in Quechua, this annual herb native to southern South America is treated both as a culinary and medical plant by the indigenous peoples of Peru, Ecuador, and other areas of the High Andes. A botanical relative of the marigold, it produces small, insignificant yellow-white flowers born on tall, erect plants often reaching 6 to 10 feet in height (depending on the fertility of the soil).

The glossy, dark green, fern-like leaves are the part used in cookery, and are extremely pungent when crushed. They are also dried for use during the winter. A pesto made from the leaves is sold commercially in South America under the name “black mint paste” which is popularly used with potatoes. Herbals teas from both the leaves and flowers are used for chest colds and stomach ailments.

Seeds should be started indoors and then transplanted to the garden after all threat of frost has past. The plants are slow to grow during the early summer but will mature rapidly at the onset of shorter day-length in September. Once established they will reseed from year to year because small birds are fond of the seeds and will carry them into all parts of the garden. For seed purposes, allow 150 days to maturity.

A rambling shrub that will grow to 20 feet with support or can be pruned into an upright shrub that is 8 feet tall with branches that root where they touch the ground. The shiny leaves are divided into 5-7 toothed and pointed leaflets, similar to a rose leaf. Orange-red long tubular flowers bloom in clusters during the fall and winter. Plant in sun or light shade, needs little water. Cold hardy to 23° F although may lose leaves so leaves as temperatures fall below 25° F and tolerate seaside conditions. It is resistant to deer predation but the flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. A good plant that can be left in its natural form or can be sheared for use as a screen or hedge. This plant is native to a large part of South Africa and found throughout Northern Province, Mpumalanga, Swaziland, KwaZulu-Natal, Cape coast and Mozambique. The name Tecomaria comes from this plants resemblance to the new world genus Tecoma, whose name comes from the native Mexican Nahuatl language name for plants with trumpet like flowers. The specific epithet means coming from the cape, in this case the Cape region of South Africa. Many references have this as a species of Tecoma.

=====
Tithonia diversifolia is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.
It is native to eastern Mexico and Central America but has a nearly pantropical distribution as an introduced species.[1] Depending on the area they may be either annual or perennial. It has shown great potential in raising the soil fertility in soils depleted in nutrients.[3] Originating in Mexico; research has shown its potential in benefiting poor African farmers.[4] This plant is a weed that grows quickly and has become an option as an affordable alternative to expensive synthetic fertilizers.[5] It has shown to increase plant yields and the soil nutrients of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).

Tithonia diversifolia is 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) in height with upright and sometimes ligneous stalks in the form of woody shrubs. The large, showy flowers are yellow to orange colored and 5–15 cm wide and 10–30 cm long. Leaves are sub-ovate, serrate, acute, 10 to 40 cm long, simply or mostly 3-7 lobed, somewhat glandular, and slightly grayish beneath. The seeds are achenes, 4-angled, and 5mm long. The seeds are spread by wind.[6] The leaves of the plant alternate in sides they grow on, which is where the plant gets the name diversifolia. This is accompanied by flowers which are yellow in colour and range from 6–13 cm in length.[7] It can grow throughout the year and its seeds are spread through way of wind, water, and animals.
