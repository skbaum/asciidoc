This very tasty variety did well for us in our 2018 grow-outs. 2.5 feet tall, indeterminate rugose leafed plants, produced 6-8 ounce tomatoes that had very nice flavor and texture. Plants have dense foliage, so it can sometimes be difficult to see fruits. Without hurting the suckers, we pruned some of the bottom leaves to better see fruits. That worked well! Our fruits reminded me of Black Krim, but with a firmer texture. Very good sandwich tomato and more! Expect first ripened fruits about 75 days after transplant."

"This tomato really knows how to party, and not just because of the name. Dwarf Confetti’s striped skin is a festive addition to any garden or food dish, and the sweet flavor has a pizzaz that many older dwarf tomato varieties lack. Slightly flattened 6-8 oz globe fruit have yellow/pink bicolored flesh. High yielding plants benefit from a short cage or staking so they don’t fall over. With over 100 tomatoes already in our catalog, it’s rare that one gets instant approval from the whole Adaptive Seeds team, and Dwarf Confetti did just that. Variety released in 2018 by the Dwarf Tomato Project."

The original tomato had an explosion of beetroot red interior flesh colour, so the naming of this tomato is a kind of memorial I guess."

Plants are “tree type” and grow to about 3.5 feet tall. They produce 6-8 ounce fruits that are balanced, which are earthy and satisfying. Maralinga Dwarf  plants can be grown in containers for patio growing, but they work well in small or large garden spaces too. Growing about two feet apart would do perfectly fine for most dwarf varieties. Container plants do require a little more attention. Maralinga Dwarf is perfect for sandwiches, drying, slicing, fresh eating and drying. But they are also very attractive on your table if you are a market vendor.

--------------

"75 days, dwarf — 'Rosella Purple' is similar to 'Cherokee Purple' in color, size, shape and flavor but on a dwarf growing plant.

The fruits are oblate, ranging from six to twelve ounces, and ripen to a deep purple-pink color. Flavor is full, intense, balanced and delicious.

'Rosella Purple' originated from a cross between 'Budai' (a small red fruited dwarf) and 'Stump of the World', made in 2006 by Patrina Nuske Small in Australia. A subsequent selection discovered by Craig LeHoullier led to 'Rosella Purple'. It was grown out to its ninth generation before being released, and is a quite stable open-pollinated variety, but still may produce the occasional off-type plant.

Others involved in its development are David Lockwood (Australia), Lee Newman, Dee Sackett, Paola Gelmetti, Linda Black, Susan Anderson, Patty Brown, Reinhard Kraft (Germany) and Bill Minkey.

This was a Victory Seed Company introduction for 2011 and one of the first dwarf varieties from the "Dwarf Tomato Project.""

The plentiful, medium large (six to fourteen ounces), smooth, oblate fruit are produced on vigorous, rugose, potato leaf dwarf plants. The medium yellow tomatoes, often showing a pale pink blossom end blush, have an intense, wonderful and memorable flavor.

When the original release of 'Summertime Gold' showed too much of a similarity to 'Dwarf Mr. Snow', likely due to some lingering segregation of genes, Craig LeHoullier and Lee Newman began a new selection process. The result is this improved version that they named 'Summer Sweet Gold', which is exactly what they had hoped for with the original release of 'Summertime Gold'. A bit smaller in average size and a bit later maturing than 'Summertime Gold', this variety was introduced in 2015."

Tasmanian Chocolate
-------------------

"85 days, dwarf — The plants of 'Tasmanian Chocolate' have dark green, regular leaf,  rugose foliage, stout central stems, and grows to three to four feet in height. Perfect for a large pot or garden. The fruits are oblate, ranging from five to twelve ounces, and ripen to a deep mahogany color. Flavor is full, balanced and delicious.

'Tasmanian Chocolate' originated from a cross between 'New Big Dwarf' (an historic large fruited pink dwarf) and 'Paul Robeson', made in 2006 by Patrina Nuske Small in Australia. The variety was further selected and named by Linda Reid of Tasmania. Now past its ninth generation, it is a quite stable open-pollinated variety but still may produce the occasional off-type plant.

Others involved in its development were Craig LeHoullier, Lee Newman, Greg Fee, Michael Volk, Tim McElroy, Howard Kushner, Paul Fish and Bill Minkey. This was a Victory Seed Company introduction for 2011 and one of the first introductions from the "Dwarf Tomato Project."

"Tasmanian Chocolate dwarf tomato is a full flavored and beautiful fruit. They grow on plants that are about 3.5 feet tall. These will perform well in buckets or in the ground. Plants produce plenty, light chocolate colored fruits that can reach 12 ounces. Take a bite and you will discover a really juicy fruit that has a bit of earthiness to it. Plants quickly become top heavy so some staking may be necessary. You can expect your first ripened fruits around the 80 day mark."
