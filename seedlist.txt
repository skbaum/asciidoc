Aribibi Gusano aka Caterpillar Chili
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"The Aribibi Gusano is a weird and wonderful looking habanero type chili pepper.  It originates from the city Aribibi in Bolivia and Gusano is the spanish word for worm – hence its name.  Obviously it is also known as „Caterpillar Chili Pepper“ because of its caterpillar look. This is another relatively rare chili that grows fairly compact into an umbrella like shape.  Don’t let the little innocent shaped pods fool you this is a true hottie.  Pods mature from a lovely light green to creamy white when ripe. They have a strong citrus flavor and the yield of the plants are very high. 300,000 – 470,000 SHU."

https://www.ebay.com/itm/162699021036[+https://www.ebay.com/itm/162699021036+]

"Aribibi Gusano or Caterpillar chilli is a very cool looking and rare little plant from Bolivia. Gusano means “Worm” in Spanish, so that’s where they get the name, as they look like a little worm or caterpillar, very very cool.

The Caterpillar Chilli is a beautiful looking plant. It grows to around 60 cm in a pot and has sort of an umbrella shape. An amazing producer of hundreds of pods. The pods are about 4-5 cm long, 1 cm  wide and look like a Caterpillar with their wrinkles. They start off a light green, then change to a creamy white and finishing white. Looks spectacular and is a new favourite of ours.

Crisp and fresh with a sweet flavour.  Stingy habanero heat. Surprisingly hot."

https://thehippyseedcompany.com/product/caterpillar-chilli/[+https://thehippyseedcompany.com/product/caterpillar-chilli/+]

"So, this Aribibi Gusano is an odd pepper or chilli, weirdest form, creamy white to yellowish like when it is ripe. More strange, it has a list of possible names about an arm long. Scientifically we are talking about the Capsicum chinense Jacquin cv. 'Aribibi Gusano' but it is also known as Aribibi, Aribibi Gusano, Aji Gusanito, Habanero Aribibi Gusano, Aribibi Gusanito, Caterpillar Pepper, Aribibi Caterpillar, Arivivi Gusano and last but not least Turtle Claw. Now this chilli is supposed to be a chinense, but is also called a Frutescens or a Frutescens / Chinense cross. Now, have I lost you? Well only good as that is how I felt after doing a bit of extra research."

Beetroot Flat of Egypt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"‘Beetroot Flat of Egypt’ is a very old heritage variety with a flattened heart-shaped root. It is known by a number of variants on the name - The ‘Egyptian Flat Rooted Beetroot’, ‘Egyptian Beetroot’ or even, would you believe, The ‘Egyptian Turnip Rooted Beetroot’!
Originating in Egypt, (although you may never have guessed), it was first described in the early 1800's and was common in seed catalogues from 1870. In 1885, Vilmorin said “An exceedingly early variety and certainly the best of the early kitchen-garden kinds”. In France it is better known as Betterave 'Rouge Noir Plate d’Egypte'.

Egyptian Beetroot produces smooth skinned roots, often heart-shaped, more wider than tall, with a deep red, tender and flavoursome flesh. Its interior has no fibrous 'strings' and its sweet flesh is a deep crimson/burgundy. It is particularly good when eaten raw, for instance when grated in salads.
The plants are shorter than conventional beet relatives and the leaves are a beautiful blend of emerald green and crimson/burgundy.

Egyptian Beetroot has rapid early season growth and, as most of the root forms above the ground, the mature beet can be pulled rather than dug in 50 to 60 days. It is ideal for early sowings in cold frames and for successional sowing outside for a prolonged cropping period. It is at its best when grown in spring and summer as the exposed mature beetroot does not enjoy hard frosts.
The plants are quick growing, very early maturing, and resistant to bolting. They are recommended for shallow soils and growing in cold frames and can be grown closer together than most heritage varieties because the plants do not develop large tops."

Komatsuna F1 Comred
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Despite being one of Japan's most popular vegetables, in the western world Komatsuna is one of the least known of all the oriental greens
Most Asian greens taste fairly similar with only subtle differences between them. Komatsuna has a lovely interesting taste: sweet, slightly sour and very tender. The mild flavour is a happy compromise between the blandness of cabbage and the sharpness of most of the oriental mustards. The common name of Mustard Spinach can be rather confusing, it is not at all pungent and has a very mild brassica flavour.

Komatsuna does not make full hearts, but matures to make lovely roundish emerald green leaves that sit atop perfectly juicy stems. This leafy green is the Japanese equivalent of our Spring Cabbage; the leaves are great in salads or simply cooked as you would spinach. Stir fry or steam as an easily prepared and very tasty and nutritious leafy vegetable.

This versatile vegetable can be used at any stage of growth from babyleaf or teen leaf stage. The leaves can be harvested individually as needed, or the whole plant can be snipped off just above the roots. The leaves will resprout from the roots after cutting and usually at least two cuttings can be made before rejuvenating the soil and replanting is necessary.

Like many other Asian greens, Komatsuna are very easy to grow: vigorous and adaptable. They are among the hardiest and most productive winter vegetables coping well with both high and low temperatures and being more tolerant of drought than most oriental brassicas.

Komatsuna ‘F1 Comred’ has rich ruby red leaves and contrasting green stems. Ideal as micro or baby greens, the flat, round leaves are tinted red above and green with red veins below, they maintain their colour under crop covers or glasshouse, even in hot weather. The plants are uniform with excellent upright growth for easy harvest
The new generation of F1 hybrid Komatsuna, bring some significant improvements to this underrated vegetable. Komatsuna can now be sown virtually every month of the year, for glasshouse or tunnel crops or open field."

Leaf Beet, Perpetual Spinach Everglade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Perpetual Spinach is not spinach, nor is it perpetual, but it does grow reliably for quite a long time in the garden.
This old heirloom is, in fact a relative of chard. You rarely see it in the shops because it ideally needs to be picked soon before eating. The leaves are shiny green with white midribs, the steamed stalks taste something like mild asparagus.

Perpetual Spinach 'Everglade' is a modern selection with an upright habit and dark green compact leaves that contrast sharply with bright white stems. It can be grown as a baby leaf or left to grow to maturity.
Growing to around 50cm (20in) in the first year, it responds particularly well to repeat cutting and is one of the easiest and most productive vegetables for a small space.

Perpetual Spinach is extremely resistant to bolting, so with just one sowing you can feast on these succulent dark green leaves and white stalks the entire summer and through autumn and winter.
Use raw in salads, steamed with other greens or in place of spinach. Include in quiche or lasagne for a savory change of pace."

Lettuce Little Gem Maureen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"At last a real little gem selection from an Organic source. A firm favourite for generations of gardeners, Little Gem is a well known compact variety of Cos lettuce. It is one of the best you can grow.
Little Gem ‘Maureen’ is a high quality selection; with improved tolerance to tip burn and resistance to Bremia BL, Downy Mildew, which is very helpful in wet summers. It will tolerate hot weather and resist bolting. The small, compact plants are uniform and quick to mature. They form crisp, tightly filled sweet hearts densely packed with flavour.

Suited to sowing March to July outdoors for harvesting May to October, sow little and often to ensure a continuous supply. Little Gem Maureen is also a good choice for containers and can be grown all year round with a greenhouse and cloche.
If you thought Little Gem was the tastiest lettuce, this selection has an even better flavour, try it, you are bound to be delighted!

Little Gem Lettuce 'Maureen' was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit (AGM) in 2012.   t has been trialed, tested and is recommended by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany.

Lettuce Lobjoits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"'Lobjoits Green Cos' is considered by many to be the best lettuce that you can grow or eat. Smaller and more compact than most other romaine’s, this excellent variety forms elongated 20cm (8in) heads with self folding leaves.
Cultivated since 1790, this heirloom romaine is renowned for its reluctance to bolt in summer and is one of the most reliable varieties for autumn sowing and over-winter growing under protection. 60 to 65 days.

Lobjoits Green Cos is slow to develop with slightly savoyed dark green leaves and a creamy white heart. A home-grown one will astonish you with its freshness and taste. The flavour is sweet and intense, the crispness unrivaled and the crunchy midrib is particularly succulent.

Lettuce 'Lobjoits Green Cos' was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit (AGM) in 1993 .
It has been trialed, tested and is recommended by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany.


With an excellent flavour and good keeping qualities Romaine, also called Cos Lettuce, is the second most popular lettuce next to iceberg. It adds crunch and flavour to mixed green salads and is the lettuce of choice for Caesar salads.
Romaine is normally grown at high density to give a top quality product with excellent sweet flavour. They can be grown all year and are very useful for cloches; an autumn or early spring sowing will provide really early crops.
Easy to grow, even in the smallest of gardens they can be grown in pots on a balcony or patio. "

Lettuce Rougette de Monpellier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Rougette de Montpellier is very old variety that originated in France. It is also very popular in Northern Italy where it is also known as Rougette Du Midi or Parella Rossa. A mini butterhead that makes a perfect baby butterhead lettuce, it is one of the originals in a whole class of lettuces that are just now becoming popular.

With perfect rosette shaped heads, the loosely formed leaves are deep green kissed with ruby red accents at the leaf tips. It has the soft, tender, butter-textured leaves with sweet, succulent flavour typical of Butterhead lettuces.
The crunchy sweet buttery heads grow to be fairly small, around 15cm (6in) or so, with open leaves and a small tight centre head. They are quick to size up and are fully mature in around 52 days.

Rougette de Montpelier is very hardy and resistant to frost. Good when planted in spring and great as an autumn crop, they have good resistance to low temperatures - even sub zero and hold well into winter."

Minutina aka Erba Stella
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Minutina, also known as Erba Stella is a unique, cold weather salad green prized in Italy for its mild nutty flavour and crunchy texture. Resembling a narrow mizuna it develops into a small plant with a delicate rosette of slender green leaves. The narrow leaves have little “horns” along the edges.

Like miner’s lettuce, corn salad, wild rocket and mizuna, Minutina, is very hardy and will stand all winter in an unheated greenhouse. Often planted for winter salads it can tolerate moderate frosts and be grown all winter in temperate climates.
Incredibly easy to grow, sow in rows in the garden or in containers and harvest after just seven weeks at approx 15cm (6in) high. The leaves are at their most delicious when they are in the young and succulent phase. A perennial plant, once harvested new growth often follows again.

Minutina is a great addition to salad mixes for variety in leaf shape and texture, it can be used in oriental dishes and stir fried in or can simply be pan fried with the most basic ingredients. Use as an edible bed for seafood, cooked vegetables and meat medallions, it is an ideal garnish for main entrées and perfect for savory creations."

Mizuna F1 Red Knight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Mizuna F1 Red Knight' is a new red hybrid Mizuna, great for adding colour in a salad. The purple-red leaf blades contrast wonderfully against green undersides. It has a long petiole and thick bladed leaves with shallow serrations. Vigorous and high yielding.

The marvellous Mizuna is an oriental wonder! It grows as a large rosette of finely serrated, feathery leaves, which are dark, glossy green, similar to rocket leaves. A very hardy plant, being both heat and cold tolerant, it usually grows better in moist conditions.
The flavour is fresh but not overpowering and a characteristic peppery-cabbage flavour. It can be used raw in salads or cooked for stir-fries or soups. The young flowering stems can be cooked like broccoli.

Naturally vigorous, Mizuna, together with its partner Mibuna, is ideally suited to, and one of the most versatile 'Cut and Come Again' winter vegetables. It is very easy to grow and can be cut back 4 to 5 times - the new growth being more resistant to frosts and snow."

Mustard Red Dragon F1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Upright, fast and frilly, Mustard ‘F1 Red Dragon’ is a mild mustard, a recent introduction that is quick growing yet refined, with good taste, texture and colour that will set your salads apart.
The broad but heavily indented leaves resemble oak leaves and are beautifully patterned purple and green, with lime green petioles and purple veining throughout.
The mild tangy flavour has a very subtle horseradish overtone but is without the heat of some of the other mustards. The plants make the classic indent leaf early in the growing cycle and make a beautiful baby leaf in the salad bowl.
‘Red Dragon’ has good vigour and uniformity and has been bred for fast growth and resistance to bolting, so it is slower to go to seed in summer heat than many other varieties. It does not require warm soil for germination, so it’s an excellent choice for early spring right through to late autumn cropping. Growing to just 30cm (12in) tall, the plants mature in just 35 days.

Easy to grow, oriental mustards pack a peppery dijon-like wallop in salads. They are fantastic when lightly steamed, stir-fried or sautéed. Use in bean soups, julienned, or as a substitute for spinach in your quiche. They are also delicious with cold beef dishes instead of horseradish or simply add to salads for a unique flavour.
They can be sown little and often and eaten as mini micro greens or used as a garnish. Alternately grow until the leaves are a few centimetres in size and use in a baby leaf salad and mesclun mixes. Left to grow to full size, whole heads can be harvested, or pick individual mature leaves one or two at a time and the plant will continue to grow.

Mustard is a good-looking plant, the red-tinged leaves intensifying to deep burgundy purple in cold weather. In the garden it looks gorgeous whether partnered with flowers, herbs and other vegetables. It is both ‘cold and bolt’ tolerant and often to be found in the ornamental garden or the potager, where it adds colour from autumn right through to spring. As a final encore, if allowed to flower, it has incredible yellow flowers that emerge as a tall spike out of its centre."

Mustard Wasabi-Na
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Mustard ‘Wasabi-na’ is a Japanese specialty green mustard bred for its wasabi like flavour. The name means ‘like wasabi’ in Japanese because the taste of the leaves remind you of the flavour of wasabi.
The bright green leaves are deeply serrated with curly edges when mature. They are beautiful as a baby leaf, give volume to winter salads and are very good for bunching. Use delicate baby leaves for salad and fresh eating and mature leaves for tsukemono, ohitashi, stir-frying, and pickling.

Seeds can be sown little and often and eaten as micro-greens or used as a garnish. Alternately grow until the leaves are a few centimetres in size and use in a baby leaf salad and mesclun mixes. Left to grow to full size, whole heads can be harvested, or pick individual mature leaves one or two at a time and the plant will continue to grow.
The flavour is at its best when grown briskly so plant in fertile soil and keep well watered. Start harvesting at 20 days for baby leaf or 45 days to maturity. For cut-and-grow-again crops, seed can be densely broadcast.

Oriental Mustards can be grown almost all year round. Sown in late summer the nutritious greens will grow away quickly with little chance of the bolting that affects other crops sown earlier on in the growing season. Oriental Mustards are also a good cool season annual, while there are not many vegetables that will put up with low light levels and cold temperatures to produce a fulsome harvest, these hardy vegetables positively thrive where others fail."

Onion, Red Welsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Allium fistulosum is a non-bulbing, leaf onion that produces clumps of tube-like hollow leaves with large creamy white globe shaped flowers in early summer of the second season. It is a very popular cultivated vegetable and an important ingredient in Asian cuisine. In Japan it is used in miso soup and in the takoyaki dumpling dish, among others.
It is a versatile plant, the seeds can be used as sprouts, the leaves snipped for use in salads or the whole plant pulled up. It is often grown in a bunch as an ornamental plant.

The Red Welsh is an old form of the perennial bunching onion with very decorative red stalks and a slightly stronger flavoured than the white variety. It is also slightly hardier. It is distinguished from the bulb onion by its round hollow leaves and only slight bulb formation. They are an interesting addition to a vegetable plot or herb garden that, once established, tend to look after themselves.
The flowers are attractive to bees, while the whole plant is an effective insect repellent. It is very easy to grow from seed, extremely hardy and pest resistant. It will grow from cold regions right through to hot, tropical areas.

"Welsh" is a corruption of the German "Walsch" meaning "foreign" and has no reference to Wales. The onion originated in Siberia, and is very popular in the East where it is known as Japanese leek, Japanese bunching onion or nebuka. The Welsh onion is also known as spring onion, ciboule (French), zwiebel (German), negi, chibol, sybie, sybow, and stone leek. While fistulosum means "hollow"."

Pak Choi Rubi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Pak Choi 'Rubi' is quite simply, a little star. Very quick to crop, easy to grow and slow to bolt. This purple/red leaved variety with bright green stems looks as attractive in the garden as on a plate. Perfect for adding colour to baby leaf mixes, it be used as a babyleaf veg or as whole head shredded leaves in stir-fries.

Pak Choi 'Rubi' F1 can be harvested in three to six weeks and can be treated as a 'cut and come again' crop; harvesting a few leaves at a time. Alternatively the whole head can be lifted entirely and cut 2.5cm above ground level and left to re-sprout.

The flavour is sweet with a hint of mustard. It is used to enhance everything from soups to stir-fries and can be eaten young in salads or left to mature. Pak choi goes well with the flavours of soy sauce, hot peppers, and toasted sesame oil. It is used in Won Ton Soup and Chow Mein. Young flowering stems can be used like broccoli or as a substitute for spinach."

Pea Mangetout Carouby de Maussane Sugar Pod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Although not widely available commercially, the vintage, sugar pod type pea 'Carouby de Maussane' has been enjoying a small-scale renaissance among heritage vegetable enthusiasts.

The pods that are thin, flat and wide and grow to 12cm (5in) or so long, they are very sweet and tender. They are at their best harvested when the peas are barely showing, but remarkably they retain their flavour even when they reach a huge size and don't develop any fibre layer at any stage.
The vigorous vines grow 140 to 150cm (around 54in / 1.5m). Eight peas per pod is about average. Not that it makes much difference if you're eating the whole pod. The seeds are brown and dimpled.

The vine of 'Carouby de Maussane' are exceptionally beautiful. They are covered with beautiful lavender and purple flowers and the leaf axils are stained with dark purple. The flowers are borne in pairs and curl downwards, they change colour as they mature. Young flowers are a deep dusky pink, maturing through purple shades to a lovely sky blue. The wing petal, which is much less visible than on other pea varieties, is deep velvety maroon. The strong dark veining on the backs of the petals greatly adds to their attractiveness.
To be honest you could grow it in the flower border just for its beauty.

Originating in Maussane near Avignon in France, not only is the flavour superior, this beautiful plant has several unique or unusual traits and clearly differs from modern conventional peas. This heirloom is truly a gem."

Rocket Olive Leaf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Relatively unknown to our shores, Rocket ‘Olive Leaf’ is an excellent selection of the traditional Italian olive leaf wild rocket. Known as 'A Foglia Di Olivo', the foliage and flavour are both untypical of the wild rocket we have recently come to know.

Olive Leaf has a beautiful light green colour and smooth shape similar to an olive leaf, without the serrations usually associated with wild rocket. It has a distinctive aroma and more intense flavour than the cultivated types but the flavour is more subtle than the usual wild rockets.
This perennial form of wild rocket is very easy to grow. It is a drought tolerant, extremely cold hardy, evergreen. It has a prostrate habit and is resistant to bolting.

It seems strange that a peppery little leaf should have had such a big impact on cooking but, over the past ten years, nothing can quite beat rocket for its ubiquity. There is good reason for it, too. You can think of rocket in three ways: as a herb, as a salad leaf and as a wilted green, so if you’re a fan of its peppery bite, you can pretty much use it in anything."

Scorzonera Duplex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Corporate chain grocery stores and the industrialisation of our food supply may have decreased the diversity of vegetables people consume. While there may be a number of movements working to combat such trends, more adventurous gardeners have always found and grown these lively vegetables.
Salsify and scorzonera are good examples of vegetables that have been around for centuries but have eluded the grocery stores. Scorzonera has an oyster-like taste while Salsify's flavour has been described as more of a cross between oysters and asparagus. Some people complain that salsify is more fibrous, and harder to peel than scorzonera, while others remain loyal to Salsify. The plants are grown the same way. Grow small plantings of both, experiment a little and decide for yourself.

Scorzonera is a root vegetable with an awkward name and an ugly appearance but with a delicious oyster-like flavour. ‘Duplex’ is a fine selection with long, truncated roots with a deep black skin. The root is considered to be finer textured, and remains so further into the winter.
Duplex is popular with home gardeners, it is known for its resistance to running from seed it also appears hardier than other selections. The foliage does not die down during the heat of the summer so the plants can be also be grown for perennial greens.

The new growth at the top of the plants, called chards can also be used in spring, cooked like asparagus or used in salads. These tops can be forced in darkness, much as chicory. The roots can be peeled, boiled, chopped into pieces and served with a tasty sauce for a gourmet delicacy.
Oh, and if you let them flower, you will be pleasantly surprised. They have gorgeous bright yellow flowers that exude a pleasant aroma redolent of sweet chocolate."

Tatsoi x Pak Choi F1 Kuro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"No one interested in vegetable growing can fail to be inspired by the Chinese people and the diversity and productivity of their vegetables. Traditionally Chinese farmers bred and saved their own seed, an eminently sensible practice as over the years strains were bred and selected that were adapted to the locality. This is most true of the beloved workhorses of the vegetable garden, the Brassicas, many of which have only ten chromosomes and generally intercross.

Global cuisine and an increasingly culturally diverse population have introduced these piquant greens to grower’s world wide. They are becoming an important crop for the home producer, as so many of which have proved to be ideally suited to the cooler months of autumn and spring when our choice of vegetables is limited. Many have been previously unavailable in seed form; this treasure trove of highly adaptable vegetables is becoming larger each year.

‘F1 Kuro’ is a traditional hybrid Pak Choi and Tatsoi cross, that produces plants with an upright habit, luminescent green flat stems and tender, dark green, thick glossy leaves. With the traditional advantages of Pak Choi and the Tatsoi's beautiful dark green, spoon-shaped leaves, they form a plant worthy to be grown for its culinary and decorative value.

It is suitable for both baby leaf and whole head production and can be harvested anytime during growth. As a baby leaf it has an attractive round leaf shape.
‘F1 Kuro’ matures from seed in only 45 to 50 days and is able to withstand temperatures as low as -10°C (15°F). It will often continue to grow throughout winter, and can even be harvested from beneath snow, making it one of the best vegetables to grow in a cool climate."

Karate Cabbage

"Now here is something unique! Originally sourced from seedsman, George Stevens (Synergy Seeds), this Ethiopian green grows quickly to a nice mound of shiny light green leaves that have an amazing texture and sweet flavor that truly tastes buttery; yes that’s right, like butter! Must be tried to be believed. Also Known as “Ethiopian Kale” or Abyssinian mustard."

"This unique green hails from Ethiopia and goes by a few different names. It is not quite kale, nor mustard, nor cabbage. Whatever you want to call I'm sure you'll agree it is delicious. Buttery sweet flavor that can be eaten raw or cooked. Prolific producer of cut and come again leaves that will overwinter in many climate zones. As seed producers we loved the heavy seed yield and the fact that it won't cross pollinate with other brassica crops!"

Lady Murasaki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"(45 days) Open-pollinated. Brassica rapa Lady Murasaki, the courtly author of The Tale of Genji, considered one of the world’s first and finest novels, is an apt namesake for this elegant komatsuna (Japanese mustard spinach). Murasaki means ‘purple’ in Japanese—and this variety is so very purple that it lured me through a field of about three dozen other kinds of greens to get a closer look. The slow-growing 8–10" deep purple rounded leaves stand as beautifully as a lady-in-waiting, without bolting, and are mild and delectable all the way through the season."

Maruba Santoh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"(35 days) Brassica rapa (pekinensis group) Open pollinated. With Maruba you get four vegetables in one. The loose round vibrant chartreuse leaves provide a mild piquant mustardy flavor while the flat white stems impart a juicy crisp pac choy taste. High-end chefs like to use the blossoms. Market grower Scott Howell finds the flavor more subtle and complex than that of other greens and cuts Maruba small for his mesclun. Fairly bolt tolerant, so plant after the early spring flea beetle invasion subsides."

Mibuna
~~~~~~

"A fast-growing and popular Japanese edible green. An unusual edible, the short plants grow with a clumping habit, leaving the edible foot long stalks and leaves. Leaves have a mustard-like flavor and are popular as an addition to salads and cooked foods. Easy to grow. Annual."

http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/mibuna-seeds[+http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/mibuna-seeds+]

"Mibuna is a delicate and unusual plant that has been grown for centuries in Japan and named after the town of Mibu.
It has several characteristics that distinguish it from other Japanese greens, each plant comprises of many slender spear-shaped leaves that emerge from the soil in clumps. The dark green leaves have rounded tips and iridescent pale green stems. They have a faint, sweet mustard flavour that intensifies as the plant matures.

It is best enjoyed in baby leaf salads where its addictive flavour can shine, or in stir-fries for a milder taste. Perfect for “cut and come” scissor harvest, this vigorous grower is tolerant of heat but thrives as a cool weather crop. In Japan, mibuna is also pickled or used in soups.

Mibuna is closely related to Mizuna, not as a vigorous - but with a stronger flavour. Its leaves tend to be longer and narrower having rounded tips. Mibuna is one of the most versatile 'Cut and Come Again' winter vegetables. It is very easy to grow and can be cut back 4-5 times - the new growth being more resistant to frosts and snow."

Mizuna, 605 Summer

"A taste of Kyoto’s culinary heritage, this heat tolerant Mizuna variety was originally bred to withstand the heat and intense humidity of Japan’s interior. Summer Mizuna is incredibly bolt resistant, even in the face of punishing heat and moisture. Mizuna is suitable for several harvests and can be eaten at all stages. This variety is traditionally sown for high summer harvest, when the juicy, watery stems make the most refreshing mid-day snack."

Okahijik, Land Seaweed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"An exotic herbal vegetable that is popular for use in Japanese cooking. Leaves are rich in minerals and vitamins and are used both at the young and mature stages when added to salads, sushi and steamed foods. Grows to 12". 

http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/salsola-komarovii-okahijiki-land-seaweed-seeds[+http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/salsola-komarovii-okahijiki-land-seaweed-seeds+]

"Salsola komarovii, is considered one of Japan’s oldest vegetables. A gourmet speciality, popularly known as Okahijiki, it gets its name from the fact that it looks like seaweed (hijiki), but grows on land (oka). This annual plant is found in the wild growing in salt laden coastal marshes. It is cultivated, harvested and sold in Japanese markets in very small packets.
In Japanese cuisine Okahijiki is a traditional vegetable that has many uses. Often it is used as an ingredient in sushi, in dressed salads or as an accompaniment for numerous fish or white meat based dishes. 

Okahijiki is a bit of stunner to look at. It has vibrant green stems and that fantastic springiness that you get with succulent plants, a quality often to be found in the garden but not often in edible plants. A first tentative taste of a sprig reveals a surprising texture, biting into a stem the tubular leaves and branched stems are juicy with a crisp texture and salty flavour.
Its delicate flavour is easily drowned out if it is mixed with other strong flavours. It is best either eaten raw in salads, steamed or blanched briefly in salted water and then quickly cooled in iced water before serving. It is wonderful when simply cooked in butter or oil and served while the fine stems still have their crispness intact.

Okahijiki is an annual plant that is very easily grown either in the garden or in containers, the plants grow vigorously in warm weather. An interesting plant for home gardening or for home cooking."

Senposai
~~~~~~~~

F-1 hybrid. Developed in Japan, a cross between Komatsuna (Japanese Mustard Spinach Brassica rapa) and regular cabbage. “Customers buy it once because it looks absolutely stunning, then they buy it again because it is extremely delicious. Absurdly productive and easy to grow,” raves John Eisenstein of Port Royal, Pa. Round medium-green leaves are wonderful in okonamiyaki or for braising. A spring sowing will stand the entire summer (even through drought) and well into fall before bolting. Can be overwintered in warmer climes or used for spring greenhouse salad production because it grows so rapidly. Open plant habit requires 12–18" spacing. 20,600 seeds/oz. Cold-hardy through at least part of the Maine winter.

Anuenue doesn’t look like much in June when most other lettuce is in full glory, but as the days get shorter and the heat gets stronger it really comes into its own. In late July and even early August, this 1987 University of Hawaii introduction has no peers for crispness and sweetness and never develops even the faintest hint of bitterness. Slow growth is its secret. It remains compact as it matures, surrounding its round tightly packed heart with crisp outer leaves. Unlike most lettuces, seed will germinate at 80°."

"The Crawford lettuce is an heirloom, black-seeded romaine cos-type lettuce that sports 10-inch heads of slightly savory green leaves with blotches of reddish brown toward the margins. It has a wonderful non-bitter flavor, loves the winter garden climate, stands up to heat well and will self-seed (for my brown-thumb friends, you must let the lettuce flower and form seed in the spring before re-seeding will occur the following year!) and sprout the following fall when temperatures are ideal. Obviously, gardeners who want the lettuce to reseed cannot cover the area in mulch. If you use lots of mulch, you should collect the seed and sow them in the fall on exposed soil. Crawford lettuce can be grown in pots and flower beds as well. When the lettuce finally bolts (flowers) and goes to seed in the spring, it is very attractive with the yellow flowers on a tall spike."

Homs Landrace Watermelon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"We are honored to be offering this diverse population of Syrian watermelons for the first time, though we're profoundly disappointed that the war in Syria itself has not abated since we started growing them years ago. Like all landraces, these Homs watermelons display a wide range of traits, and this diversity is their greatest strength. If you have never successfully grown a watermelon, try this variety. It is very forgiving. Incredibly drought tolerant, this is a great watermelon for marginal areas. Fruit range from round to oblong (with the occasional pear shape), solid green to beautifully patterned, with flesh in various shades of pink, and varying degrees of sweetness. Even the seeds vary, with some off-white and a few black, but most are off-white with a dark line around the edge. They are quite striking, and also quite delicious themselves (watermelon seeds, known as "egusi" in parts of Africa, are an incredibly nutritious and underrated food). Some of these fruit have thick rinds excellent for pickling, and many have relatively dense flesh, making them excellent for candying. As with all landraces, plant breeders could have a field day with these."

Cassia
~~~~~~

"F-1 hybrid. This excellent Italian innovation bears the name of ancient patrician family Cassia, whose most famous member proposed the first Roman land reform laws in 486 BCE and was promptly executed for pandering to the lower classes. Romanesca-type Cassia is a zucchini for the people, providing a bounty of slender, gently ribbed, and exceptionally long fruits on an easy-to-harvest open-habit plant. Although its flavor can’t match beloved but less predictable open-pollinated Costata Romanesca, Cassia sets dense nutty fruits earlier, prolifically and keeps going for weeks longer. No pithy cores. While reliable harvests of attractive and tasty fruits recommend Cassia to the specialty market, plebeian gardeners should claim it as their own. Tolerates cooler temps than other zukes, Cassia stood out in the prolonged chilly Maine spring of 2017. May not perform well in extreme heat. Recommended for standard field production and for early season planting in high tunnels."

Cornell's Bush Delicata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"This compact delicata variety is a product of Cornell University's breeding program, a breeding project lead by Molly Jahn. Bush Delicata has all the perks of a great delicata: the first winter squash to ripen, sweet, firm flesh, and great flavor. Unlike other varieties though, this one is compact enough to grow in a large container or smaller garden space. Plus, Molly bred Powdery Mildew Resistance into this variety too! Expect anywhere from 2-5 ripe fruits from each plant."

https://hudsonvalleyseed.com/cornell-s-bush-delicata.html[+https://hudsonvalleyseed.com/cornell-s-bush-delicata.html+]

"A lush, tasty squash with cream-color skin and forest-green stripes, named Cornell's Bush Delicata, has been named a 2002 All-America Selection (AAS), a seed-industry award. It is the first Cornell University-developed variety to win the prestigious award in 39 years.

The squash, bred by Molly Jahn, Cornell associate professor of plant breeding, and George Moriarty, Cornell research plant breeder, combines the best features of an heirloom-type delicata. That squash is noted for excellent eating quality and disease resistance, which reduces the need to apply fungicide during the growing season. The delicata squash was popular in the early part of the 20th century, but went out of style due to poor yields and susceptibility to disease.

Cornell's Bush Delicata is not a hybrid, as are most modern crop varieties, but an open-pollinated variety, which means the seed can be saved. It has the sweet and nutty heirloom flavor with uniform, deep yellow color and thick flesh, but better yield than the delicata."

Fig Leaf Gourd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"A climbing, annual or perennial vine that is vigorous in growth habit up to a few dozen feet. In frost free climates it can overwinter and produce for multiple years. Flowers are monoecious, but both male and female flowers are born separately on single plants, so only one plant is required to produce fruit. Fruits are oblong in shape and can grow up to 6-9" and weigh up to 10-15 pounds. A single plant is said to be able to produce up to 50 fruits. The fruits are noteworthy for their long storage life. Once mature fruits develop a hard rind that lends itself to extended storage.

Quite easy to grow. Growing requirements are similar to standard melons. The vines need regular water, full sun and room for growth. They will climb, but are easily grown as ground trailing plants. The plant seems to show more tolerance to disease than many standard melons and has subsequently been used as a rootstock in some areas.

Mature fruits have a sweet flavor and are used in desserts and beverages. Immature fruits can be cooked as a vegetable. Both the flowers and young shoots are eaten as leafy greens. The protein rich seeds are also eaten and are used to make palanquetas, a Mexican confection.

Native to the Americas, though the exact range is unknown. Today it is spread through much of tropical America and is popularly cultivated from Mexico through Argentina."

http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/content/malabar-gourd.htm[+http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/content/malabar-gourd.htm+]

"Like most members of the genus Cucurbita, C. ficifolia is a climbing vine that is an annual in temperate climates and a perennial in tropical zones. Unlike some other Cucurbita species, it does not have swollen storage roots. The plant stem can grow five to fifteen meters and produces tendrils that help it climb adjacent plants and structures. It may root from the leaf axils, unlike most other curcubits. The vine can become semiwoody if left to grow perennially, although most commercial plants are annual. Its leaves resemble fig leaves, hence its most common name in English – fig-leaf gourd – and its Latin species name (C. ficifolia which means fig leaf). The fruit is oblong, resembling a watermelon, with wide black seeds. In stark contrast to other Cucurbita, its fruit is highly uniform in size, shape, and color.

The plant is monoecious with imperfect flowers (meaning its flowers are either male or female but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and are pollinated by insects, especially bees. The color of the flowers is yellow to orange.

The fruit is oblong with a diameter of eight inches or 20 centimeters, weighs eleven to 13 pounds (5 to 6 kilograms), and can produce up to 500 seeds. Its skin can vary from light or dark green to cream. One plant can produce over 50 fruit. The fruit can last without decomposing for several years if kept dry after harvest. 

The flowers, leaves and tender shoots are used in Mexico and other countries as greens. The most nutritional part of Cucurbita ficifolia is its fat- and protein-rich seeds, which can vary in color from white to black. They are used in Mexico to make palanquetas, a sweet similar to peanut brittle. The fruit has several uses as food. The immature fruit is eaten cooked, while the mature fruit is sweet and used to make confectionery and beverages, sometimes alcoholic. The fruit is low in beta-carotene, as can be seen from its white flesh, and is relatively low in vitamins and minerals, and moderately high in carbohydrates.

In Europe: In Spain this squash is used to make a jam known as "cabello de ángel" (angel's hair), "cabell d'àngel" in Catalan, that is used to fill pies, sweets and confectionery. In Portugal, where the fruit is known as "chila" or "gila", it is still used extensively in the production of traditional Portuguese sweets and confectionery; it was also used as a crop for non-human consumption in order to feed pigs.

In Latin America: In Chile and Argentina, jam is often made out of the fruit of "alcayota" or "cayote". In Costa Rica, it is traditional to make empanadas stuffed with sugared "chiverre" filling at Easter time.

In Asia, the pulp strands are used to make soup, quite similar to shark fin soup, hence the name "shark's fin melon". The cultivation and this usage feature briefly in the film Grow Your Own. Across Asia, eating this melon is also said to help people with diabetes. Several scientific studies have confirmed its hypoglycemic effect. It is used effectively to treat diabetes due to its high D-Chiro-Inositol content.

Georgia Candy Roaster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Similar to the Banana Squash, but with even larger fruits! The huge, cylindrical fruits can grow in excess of 60 pounds. Features pink skin and orange flesh, with a great flavor that is popular for use in baking."

http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/georgia-candy-roaster-squash-seeds[+http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/georgia-candy-roaster-squash-seeds+]

"Here is a smaller strain of Candy Roaster from northern Georgia. This type of squash is famous among the people of the Southeast. Pink, banana-shaped fruit has a blue tip and weigh around 10 lbs. Delicious, smooth orange flesh is perfect baked, fried and makes great pies; hard to find and quite beautiful."

https://www.rareseeds.com/candy-roaster-north-georgia-squash/[+https://www.rareseeds.com/candy-roaster-north-georgia-squash/+]

"Rare heirloom variety. Originally cultivated by the Cherokee Indians in the Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern portion of the United States. It is still most often grown in parts of northern Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

Like many of the winter squashes enjoyed in America, this one continues to be cultivated because of seeds provided by Native Americans. The North Georgia Candy Roaster Squash is part of a group of candy roaster squashes that were all cultivated by the Cherokee and vary in shape from oblong to round."

https://simpleseasonal.com/how-to/all-about-north-georgia-candy-roaster-squash[+https://simpleseasonal.com/how-to/all-about-north-georgia-candy-roaster-squash+]

"Local to present day North Carolina, the Candy Roaster Squash is known for its sweet, unique flavor, which is the reasoning behind its name. The Cherokee tribes in the southern Appalachians originally cherished this squash for its ability to withstand winter frost  and its long shelf life; many more people have come to treasure it for its unique taste.

When fully ripe and stored for several months, it will reach its full flavor potential.  A favorite in pies, soups, butters and breads, recipes that utilize this squash do not call for any additional sugar or sweetener. When baked, stewed, boiled, or mashed its pulp can be compared to a sweet potato.

Native to the areas surrounding the Cherokee tribes in present day western North Carolina, northern Georgia, and eastern Tennessee, this food is of cultural significance to the region. There it  is considered to be the best winter squash to eat, and people still plant it in the Cherokee tradition using the “Three Sisters” farming strategy. According to the traditional companion planting technique the Candy Roaster grows around the base of the corn and pole beans (two other regionally native plants) to keep weeds from growing and to retain moisture in the soil surrounding them.

The Candy Roaster Squash can be round, oblong, or pear shaped and can often look somewhat like a pumpkin. It grows to a weight range of 10 to 250 pounds. It generally has a pink, tan, or orange color, but some varieties can include green, grey, or blue accents as well. Despite its wide-ranging appearance, most have a fine-textured orange-colored flesh and grow on large vines with large leaves.

The Cherokees in the southern Appalachian Mountains originally bred the Candy Roaster Squash in the 1800’s. The first documentation of it being introduced to those beyond the Cherokee Nation was a newspaper article from the Charlotte Observer in 1925. This article tells of the “Indian Fair at Cherokee School” where Candy Roaster Squash seeds were made available to people who applied for them through the Chamber of Commerce.  This cultivar is of immense cultural importance to the Cherokee (evinced by the Cherokee Nation’s protection of Candy Roaster Squash seeds through a seed bank from its Natural Resources Department) and to others who have come to value it over the last century.

Today, the availability of seeds for this heirloom squash is a concern. This is compounded by the fact that this squash is a variety of the squash species Cucurbita maxima, which is open pollinated. The Candy Roaster Squash can accidentally cross-pollinate with any other variety of Cucurbita maxima at distances up to 1 mile. Due to this risk, dedicated and skilled seedsmen are needed in order to protect its biodiversity and distinct genetic makeup."

Little Dipper

"F-1 hybrid. In summer 2015, we trialed a slew of those personal-size, supposedly powdery-mildew–resistant, hybrid butternuts. We were shocked to find that all but one variety melted down and yielded poorly. While we pawed around salvaging the few fruits of this and that failure, Little Dipper’s ongoing eruption of green stood in sharp contrast. The small fruits of the other personal butternuts come with restricted habit and often a correspondingly low yield. Dipper’s plethora of uniform pale-tan 2–3 lb fruits are set on fully running weed-suppressing vines. We harvested an impressive 22 fruits from 3 plants. Open-pollinated Burpee’s Butterbush stills reigns for flavor, but Dipper offers nice smooth semi-dry texture and medium nutty sweetness through long storage. While supplier stats of other varieties in the trial advertised their supposed-PMR status boldly, Little Dipper’s just warned of us of the crazy growth. For disease and worry resistance, we’ll take vigor and volume any day."

Nanticoke 
~~~~~~~~~

"The 'Nanticoke' winter squash is just plain incredible. It must be grown, seen, and tasted, to be believed. It is an unimproved landrace from the Nanticoke (or Kuskarawaok) people, who once spoke an Algonquin language and lived mainly in southern Delaware and on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake in Maryland. They were encountered by John Smith (of Pocahontas fame) in the 1600s. Today, Nanticoke people live primarily in Delaware and southern New Jersey (where they have merged with the local Lenni Lenape to form the Nanticoke Lenni Lenape Nation). Intriquingly, this squash is a Cucurbita maxima, which means it originated in Argentina. Most scientists and scholars believe all maxima squash reached North America in the 1500s or later, so the genesis of the Nanticoke squash in the mid-Atlantic region is relatively recent. Nevertheless, this landrace holds within its genome a staggering diversity.

Fruits appear in a range of colors, including blue, pink, grey, orange, coral, white, green, gold, and red (though blue, pink, and grey seem to be most common). Some fruits have a distinctive "turban" quality to them. Some have a profuse amount of warts. Some are small and round, others large and flat, and still others pointed. Some have stripes, some have dots, and some have asymmtrical splotches of color. Flavors and textures vary too, but thankfully most of them are quite delicious. In the decade since EFN co-founder Nate Kleinman first started growing them (from seeds received from Seed Savers Exchange's seed bank in Iowa), he has meticulously hand-pollinated or isolated for purity, and mainly saved and replanted seeds from the best tasting plants, regardless of form, resulting in a population that is still incredibly diverse, but has a higher proportion of good-sized (3-8 lb) and good-tasting fruit.

The vast majority of plants produce delicious fruit. We believe many of the world's favorite heirloom squash (including the Galeaux d'Eysines, the Turk's Turban, and the Rouge Vif d'Etampes, from France, and the Kabocha and Hokkaido from Japan) may have been bred from Nanticoke squash which found their way into global commerce due to the exceedingly long storeability of some fruits (we've had some last up to 18 months at room temperature). The diversity is the main reason to grow this squash: you never know what kind of fruit it will produce. We see new forms emerge every year. To a small degree we have begun selecting new varieties from the Nanticoke population, but it will be many years before any of these are stabilized. In the meantime, we are happy to share this wonderful squash with you. [20% of the proceeds of these seeds will be donated to the Nanticoke Lenni Lenape Nation based in Bridgeton, NJ.]"

Seminole Winter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Open-pollinated. Creek-speaking Seminole Indians gave it the name chassa-howitska, meaning ‘hanging pumpkin.’ Rated one of the ten most endangered American foods by RAFT, these buff-colored 7" teardrop-shaped squashes were cultivated by the Seminoles in the Everglades region of Florida in the 1500s. The seeds were sowed at the base of girdled trees, so that the irrepressible vines, which grow in excess of 30', climbed the trunks, allowing the fruit to hang from the bare limbs. The deep orange flesh is sweeter than butternut, superb for pies, soup and baked treats, and the key ingredient in delicious Seminole pumpkin bread. Rated third among 21 varieties in a 2005 fall taste test, and was co-star with Paydon in our February 2006 warehouse feast. Resistant to vine borers. Extremely hard rind must be cracked like a coconut. Stores nearly forever. A great performer in the south and along the Atlantic seaboard, it loves hot humid climates. Probably requires too long a season to thrive in the north, however Elisa Carbone of Hendricks, WV, advises that the immature fruits taste like extremely sweet zucchini. “Just chop them up and steam, sauté or make the most heavenly frittata ever!”"

The orange flesh is richly fragrant, very sweet and delicious--so sweet the juice caramelizes when baked--one of the sweetest squash anywhere! Fine for use in pies, soups or desserts, and keeps for up to nine months. Has been known to produce as much as 100 pounds of squash per plant. The plants are rugged and huge.They grow over a wide range of conditions, even in the scorching-hot summers of the Southwest. Introduced by Thompson and Morgan in 1977 from seed grown by our friend Steve Spangler of Exotica Rare Fruit Nursery in Vista, California. Steve was among the earliest people to grow Tahitian Melon squash in this country, from seed originally brought from the exotic Islands of Tahiti by a sailor in the 1960s."

The dark green to yellow skinned fruits are usually picked immature for delicious zucchini-like uses. They can also be left to mature to full size and used like a winter squash. An essential ingredient in many regional Mexican cuisines. Shows good resistance to the squash vine borer."

http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/tatume-squash-seeds[+http://www.tradewindsfruit.com/tatume-squash-seeds+]

"Do you like to try new things in the garden? If so, then 'Tatume', (also often called 'Calabacita') squash could be a worthy candidate for your next garden experiment. This hardy, open pollinated native of Mexico grows well in our hot climate and it produces pound after pound of flavorful firm fleshed squash. The long vines are prolific bloomers and they produce a large amount of flowers that are beautiful to look at and almost as good to eat as the squash itself.

Most of the squash that we are familiar with come from the species Cucurbita pepo. 'Tatume' is a variety of this species. C. pepo is a native of Meso-America and archeological evidence shows that gardeners there have been growing varieties of C. pepo for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. In America, squash is generally divided into two categories based on when they are harvested. Summer squashes such as yellow crookneck, zucchini, and pattypan are harvested in their immature state. Immature squash have a soft skin, flesh and seeds. Winter squash like butternut, spaghetti, and acorn are simply squash that are allowed to ripen on the vine before they are harvested. Winter squash have a thick hard skin and their flesh is generally firmer and sweeter than summer squash. 'Tatume' is one the rare varieties of squash that can be harvested as either a summer or winter type.
tatume fruit

The fruits of the 'Tatume' squash are round or oblate in shape. Their skins is striped green and they resemble a small watermelon or pumpkin in their immature form. It is best to harvest 'Tatume' when it is about the size of baseball. If left to mature, the skin will become a mottled, deep green and they can grow to almost the size of a soccer ball."

Tinda Gourd

"The unique Tinda squash melon gourd is indigenous to India. The round, light green fruit weigh only 3 to 4 ounces at harvest. The hairy 4' long vines flower within 30 to 35 days, and the smooth fruit is ready to pick 2 to 3 weeks later."

https://www.kitazawaseed.com/seed_321-178.html[+https://www.kitazawaseed.com/seed_321-178.html+]

"The plant is as with all cucurbits, a prolific vine, and is grown as an annual. The plant also is prickly with small thorns similar to the Zucchini. The fruit is approximately spherical, and 5–8 cm in diameter The seeds may also be roasted and eaten. Tinda is a famous nickname among Punjabi families in India. This unique squash-like gourd is native to South Asia, very popular in Indian and Pakistani cooking with curry and many gourmet dishes. Green colored, apple sized fruits are flattish round in shape and 50-60 grams in weight. Plants are vigorous, productive and begin to bear fruits in 70 days after planting.

Tinda can be confused with tendli or kundru due to similar-sounding names from different languages and regions. Tinda in Punjabi or most North Indian languages is "Indian baby pumpkin".

Tinda is considered a boring vegetable by many in North India - part of the reason is it is used in a lot of curries during high season, and tastes bland unless used with a lot of spices. Further, it's seeds are not favoured by many. It is practically unknown in South India."

"One of the unusual characteristics of the Centiflor tomatoes is that, unlike most garden tomatoes, they outcross occasionally. This creates problems in seed saving but opportunity for crosses that the bees can do. This new variety arose from a cross of Sungold with Red Centiflor. These are vigorous hypertress vines with remarkably delicious fruits."

"An absolutely amazing variety! Centiflors mean "100 flowers" and while not all of them will pollinate, these plants will still supply you with incredibly high yields. Delicious fruits, with a nice sweet flavor, are round and measure slightly under 1" each. Vigorous vines produce huge clusters of cherries that hang like grapes. Bred by Dr. Alan Kapuler, Ph.D. of Peace Seeds. Orange is a cross of Sungold and Red Centiflor. Indeterminate.  75 day."

Centiflor, Red
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"From our cross of L. humboldtii, the Grape Tress Tomato with L. hirsutum arose this unanticipated cultivar with clusters of dozens to hundreds of flowers held above the foliage where the silky hairs of the flower buds resemble insects followed by clusters of large numbers of 1" red sweet fruits that resist cracking and rot. The introduction of centiflor hypertress tomatoes as a new
development for the public domain provides parents for continued new developments in the
breeding of nutritionally and architecturally unique new cultivars. 

In the following list of tomatoes are several that flower with hypertresses. By this we mean that when they flower they have clusters of flowers and then clusters of fruits. Some like Golden Tressette have 20-40 flowers on a tress. Others like Red Centiflor, Yellow Centiflor and Orange Centiflor can have more that 100 flowers on a tress and hence we coined the term centiflor for this phenomenon. In addition, both Geranium Kiss and Full Moon Kiss have hypertresses with 20-50 or more fruits on an inflorescence.

During the decades that we have been growing tomatoes, saving their seeds and replanting them we have not found any crosses. That is until the centiflors. Occasionally the hypertress phenomenon arises in other cultivars that have bred true for a long time. Hence Dylana Kapuler has observed hypertresses in Peacevine Cherry and Palestinian heirloom.

The hypertress trait arose from a cross of a cherry tomato with an Andean species. It was completely unexpected. In order to adapt to changes in environmental conditions crosses between individuals and species (ie outbreeders) are a fundamental part of the process of evolution. As a society and gardening culture that favors tomatoes we have been growing and seeding inbreeders ie self fertile cultivars and they do not mix genetically with one another. Thus we have not been developing cultivars that are locally adapted. Only by outcrossing and especially outcrossing by local insect pollinators do we move back into the rapid and essential adaptation of tomatoes into our own gardens with their unique ecologies and that face the extreme environmental changes that are now happening."

Garden Gem
~~~~~~~~~~

" Tomato lovers, rejoice, for science has achieved the impossible: the perfect supermarket tomato. The Garden Gem won’t bruise during shipping, it resists many of the major diseases that regularly decimate tomato crops, and it is a flesh-producing powerhouse, turning out up to 22 pounds of tomatoes per plant, which is as productive as the best modern cultivars.

But there is one aspect in which the Garden Gem is very different from every other supermarket tomato: flavor. It actually has it. Lots. More than 500 sensory panelists at the University of Florida have declared it among the very best tomatoes they have tested.  

Tomato lovers, stop rejoicing. Because you will not find the perfect supermarket tomato in any supermarket. Not now, and perhaps not ever. It’s not because the Garden Gem is a genetically modified organism—it was bred the same way tomatoes have been bred for thousands of years. It’s not because some multinational owns the patent and won’t release it in the U.S. (which, unfortunately, is the case with a superb British potato called the Mayan Gold). It’s because Big Tomato doesn’t care about flavor. Tomato farmers don’t care. Tomato packers don’t care. And supermarkets don’t care."

Homs 11
~~~~~~~

"This gorgeous tomato was collected in Homs, Syria, by C.O. Eyer of the Near East Foundation in 1949 or earlier. Homs has been one of the cities most devastated by the ongoing war in Syria and is known for being a hotbed of resistance. It was also a major agricultural center. The 'Homs 11' tomato produces flat, severely fasciated (ribbed), bright red fruits on sprawling, indeterminate plants. These tomatoes are not long-keepers, so they may not be best suited for market farmers, but for the home gardener they are wonderful -- with a strong, heirloom tomato flavor, and a striking beauty. Being from Syria, the plants are extremely drought and heat tolerant."

Indigo Rose
~~~~~~~~~~~

"The first high anthocyanin (a naturally occurring pigment that has been shown to fight disease in humans) tomato commercially available anywhere in the world. The high amount of anthocyanin creates quite a vibrant indigo on 2" round fruits. The purple coloring occurs on the portion of the fruit that is exposed to light, while the shaded portion starts out green and turns deep red when mature. Inside, the flesh reveals the same red tone with a superbly balanced, multi-faceted tomato flavor. Allow fruits to mature completely for best flavor. Bred at Oregon State University. Heavy yielder.
Indeterminate.  75-80 days."

Legend
~~~~~~

"The late-blight-resistant tomato you've been looking for! Developed by Drs. Jim Myers and James Baggert at Oregon State University and released in 2008, 'Legend' is a big, early, productive, great tasting tomato. It would be worth growing even without its resistance to the killer late-blight fungus, simply for being the earliest big slicing tomato out there (fruits can reach 4-5" across). You should note that "resistance" is not the same as "immunity," but growers can expect two or three additional weeks of harvest from their 'Legend' plants beyond when late-blight infestation fully destroys the crops of other tomato varieties. This is also an uncommon "parthenocarpic" tomato variety, meaning it sets seed without fertilization, making it a great tomato for colder areas, where cool nights might otherwise make tomato flowers shrivel."

Maralinga
~~~~~~~~~

75 days, dwarf — The rugose, regular leaf plants produce heavy yields of rich-brown (yellow skinned black) tomatoes with deep crimson flesh that range between six to twelve ounces. The flavor shares the typical intensity of the best black tomatoes; rich, intense and memorable.

'Maralinga' is a "Dwarf Tomato Project" variety that originated with a cross between an early generation selection from the "Sleepy family" called 'Wilpena' and 'Cherokee Purple' made by Patrina Nuske Small in 2008 and named "Plentiful."

'Maralinga' was selected and named by Patrina who tells us that Maralinga is a, "site in an arid area of South Australia where the British carried out atom bomb tests in the 1950s causing trauma to the indigenous people who were displaced, and terrible radiation pollution. The original tomato had an explosion of beetroot red interior flesh colour, so the naming of this tomato is a kind of memorial I guess."

Minsk Early
~~~~~~~~~~~

"'Minsk Early', or 'Minskiy Ranniy', is one of the earliest tomatoes you'll ever find. We're eating them by the handful come July. Picked at peak ripeness, this small to medium-sized tomato has a lovely sweet-tart flavor and a pleasant texture. It's very productive too. Do not confuse with 'Orange Minsk,' a completely different heirloom. 'Minsk Early' is bright red.

We are curious to what extent this variety competes with other early varieties. Dusty just grew it this year in Minnesota, and it was early! Plants were put in the ground late May and started producing fruit in mid July in southern Minnesota in 2018. Seems to want to produce a bunch all at once and then fade away. Plants do not get very big, and instead will put all its energy into producing fruit."

"Selected from a well known hybrid since the early '70s, this vigorous indeterminate vine with two ranked flower spikes of a dozen flowers makes many very tasty 3/4" red fruits. In a university study of 30+ varieties of cherry tomatoes for Vitamin C content, this was #1. The fruit juice also contains 17 of the 20 amino acids used to make proteins with significant amounts of the neuromodulator GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid)."

Puerto Cortes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"This delicious tomato — our favorite for taste two years in a row — was collected by the USDA in 1976 along a road near the village of Puerto Cortes, about 20 miles outside San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras (and presently one of the most violent cities in the world, best known in the United States as the starting point for a famous migrant caravan). The fruit are not uniform — indicative of its semi-wild origins — ranging from round to somewhat flat, rarely larger than an inch and a half in diameter. The taste is a perfect blend of sweet and sour. We first grew this tomato to honor the resilient people of the San Pedro Sula region, which has been gravely affected by drug trafficking violence, corporate corruption, and political oppression. We were pleasantly surprised to find a real gem in this tomato. Very productive."

Rosella Purple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"75 days, dwarf — 'Rosella Purple' is similar to 'Cherokee Purple' in color, size, shape and flavor but on a dwarf growing plant. Regular leaf, dark green rugose foliage, stout central stem, grows to three to four feet in height. Perfect for a large container or a small garden space. The fruits are oblate, ranging from six to twelve ounces, and ripen to a deep purple-pink color. Flavor is full, intense, balanced and delicious.

'Rosella Purple' originated from a cross between 'Budai' (a small red fruited dwarf) and 'Stump of the World', made in 2006 by Patrina Nuske Small in Australia. A subsequent selection discovered by Craig LeHoullier led to 'Rosella Purple'. It was grown out to its ninth generation before being released, and is a quite stable open-pollinated variety, but still may produce the occasional off-type plant."

The firm, deep crimson flesh is mild and sweet, and the productivity and fruit size and texture make this a great canning or grilling variety.

This "Dwarf Tomato Project" variety originated with a cross between 'Black Zebra' and a pink selection of the "Cheeky family," made by Ray South and named "Streaky." 'Sarandipity' was selected and named by Craig LeHoullier after his daughter Sara."
